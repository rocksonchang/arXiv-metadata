  Bends</title><description>  We study the solutions to the wave equation in a two-dimensional tube of unit
width comprised of two straight regions connected by a region of constant
curvature. We introduce a numerical method which permits high accuracy at high
curvature. We determine the bound state energies as well as the transmission

the resonances which occur in the vicinity of channel thresholds. We explore
the dependence of these solutions on the curvature of the tube and angle of the
bend and discuss several limiting cases where our numerical results confirm
analytic predictions.

of closed systems, Gell-Mann and Hartle have argued that the variables
typically characterizing the quasiclassical domain of a large complex system
are the integrals over small volumes of locally conserved densities --
hydrodynamic variables. The aim of this paper is to exhibit some simple models
in which approximate decoherence arises as a result of local conservation. We
derive a formula which shows the explicit connection between local conservation
and approximate decoherence. We then consider a class of models consisting of a
large number of weakly interacting components, in which the projections onto
local densities may be decomposed into projections onto one of two alternatives
of the individual components. The main example we consider is a one-dimensional
chain of locally coupled spins, and the projections are onto the total spin in
a subsection of the chain. We compute the decoherence functional for histories
of local densities, in the limit when the number of components is very large.
We find that decoherence requires two things: the smearing volumes must be
sufficiently large to ensure approximate conservation, and the local densities
must be partitioned into sufficiently large ranges to ensure protection against
quantum fluctuations.

factored out in order to obtain a quantum remainder that can be treated
perturbatively without the occurrence of infrared divergences. However, this
separation, as usually performed, introduces spurious large-distance effects
that produce an apparent breakdown of the important correspondence between
stable particles and poles of the S-matrix, and, consequently, lead to apparent
violations of the correspondence principle and to incorrect results for
computations in the mesoscopic domain lying between the atomic and classical
regimes. An improved computational technique is described that allows valid
results to be obtained in this domain, and that leads, for the quantum
remainder, in the cases studied, to a physical-region singularity structure
that, as regards the most singular parts, is the same as the normal
physical-region analytic structure in theories in which all particles have
non-zero mass. The key innovations are to define the classical part in
coordinate space, rather than in momentum space, and to define there a
separation of the photon-electron coupling into its classical and quantum parts
that has the following properties: 1) The contributions from the terms
containing only classical couplings can be summed to all orders to give a
unitary operator that generates the coherent state that corresponds to the
appropriate classical process, and 2) The quantum remainder can be rigorously
shown to exhibit, as regards its most singular parts, the normal analytic
structure.

and analytic group (Lie group). In order to describe non-Hamiltonian
(dissipative) systems in quantum theory we need to use non-Lie algebra and
analytic quasigroup (loop).
  The author derives that analog of Lie algebra for quantum non-Hamiltonian
systems is commutant Lie algebra and analog of Lie group for these systems is
analytic commutant associative loop (Valya loop). A commutant Lie algebra is
an algebra such that commutant (a subspace which is generated by all
commutators) is a Lie subalgebra. Valya loop is a non-associative loop such
that the commutant of this loop is associative subloop (group). We prove that
a tangent algebra of Valya loop is a commutant Lie algebra. It is shown that
generalized Heisenberg-Weyl algebra, suggested by the author to describe
quantum non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems, is a commutant Lie algebra. As
the other example of commutant Lie algebra, it is considered a generalized
Poisson algebra for differential 1-forms.
  Note that non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) quantum theory has a broad range of
application for non-critical strings in &quot;coupling constant&quot; phase space and
bosonic string in non-Riemannian (for example, affine-metric) curved space
which are non-Hamiltonian (dissipative) systems.

  field</title><description>  We present the first purely semiclassical calculation of the resonance
spectrum in the Diamagnetic Kepler problem (DKP), a hydrogen atom in a constant
magnetic field with $L_z =0$. The classical system is unbound and completely
chaotic for a scaled energy $\epsilon \sim E B^{-2/3}$ larger than a critical
value $\epsilon_c &gt;0$. The quantum mechanical resonances can in semiclassical
approximation be expressed as the zeros of the semiclassical zeta function, a
product over all the periodic orbits of the underlying classical dynamics.
Intermittency originating from the asymptotically separable limit of the
potential at large electron--nucleus distance causes divergences in the
periodic orbit formula. Using a regularisation technique introduced in [G.\
Tanner and D.\ Wintgen, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~{\bf 75}, 2928 (1995)] together with a
modified cycle expansion, we calculate semiclassical resonances, both position
and width, which are in good agreement with quantum mechanical results obtained
by the method of complex rotation. The method also provides good estimates for
the bound state spectrum obtained here from the classical dynamics of a
scattering system. A quasi Einstein--Brillouin--Keller (QEBK) quantisation is
derived that allows for a description of the spectrum in terms of approximate
quantum numbers and yields the correct asymptotic behaviour of the
Rydberg--like series converging towards the different Landau thresholds.

examine the localised states of a large condensed object in the context of a
realistic model. Following the argument that an isolated macroscopic body is
usually described by a linear superposition of low-lying energy eigenstates, it
has been found that localised states of this type correspond to a nearly
minimum-uncertainty state for the center of mass. An indication is also given
of the dependence of the center of mass position spread on the number of
constituent particles.
 This paper is not offered as an answer to the intriguing question of the

mechanics is a ``naive realism about operators.'' By this we refer to various
ways of taking too seriously the notion of operator-as-observable, and in
particular to the all too casual talk about ``measuring operators'' that occurs
when the subject is quantum mechanics. Without a specification of what should
be meant by ``measuring'' a quantum observable, such an expression can have no
clear meaning. A definite specification is provided by Bohmian mechanics, a
theory that emerges from Sch\&quot;rodinger's equation for a system of particles
when we merely insist that ``particles'' means particles. Bohmian mechanics
clarifies the status and the role of operators as observables in quantum
mechanics by providing the operational details absent from standard quantum
mechanics. It thereby allows us to readily dismiss all the radical claims
traditionally enveloping the transition from the classical to the quantum
realm---for example, that we must abandon classical logic or classical
probability. The moral is rather simple: Beware naive realism, especially about
operators!

clarified. We then relate the pointlike scatterer to a finite-size scatterer

 It is shown that there exists some freedom in the choice of the form of the
Bargmann-Wigner scalar product: The general product depends implicitly on a
family of world-vectors. The standard choice of the product corresponds to
timelike and equal vectors which define a ``time&quot; direction. The generalized
form shows that formulas are simpler if one chooses {\it null\/} directions.
This freedom is used to derive simple covariant formulas for momentum-space
wave functions (generalized Wigner states) corresponding to arbitrary mass and
spin and using eigenstates of the Pauli-Lubanski vector. The eigenstates which
make formulas the simplest correspond to projections of the Pauli-Lubanski
vector on {\it null\/} directions. The new formulation is an alternative to the
standard helicity formalism.

adequate mathematical framework for quantum mechanics. In conjunction with the
specific quantum dynamics considered there, we give a general analysis of the
associated dichotomic jump processes. If we assume that Gillespie's
&quot;measurement probabilities&quot; \it are \rm the transition probabilities of a
stochastic process, then the process must have an invariant (time independent)
probability measure. Alternatively, if we demand the probability measure of the
process to follow the quantally implemented (via the Born statistical
postulate) evolution, then we arrive at the jump process which \it can \rm be
interpreted as a Markov process if restricted to a suitable duration time.
However, there is no corresponding Markov process consistent with the $Z_2$
event space assumption, if we require its existence for all times $t\in R_+$.

guishability for quantum states. These measures should have important appli-
cations in quantum cryptography and quantum computation theory. The results
reported include the following. An exact expression for the quantum fidelity
between two mixed states is derived. The optimal measurement that gives rise to
it is studied in detail. Several upper and lower bounds on the quantum mutual
information are derived via similar techniques and compared to each other. Of
note is a simple derivation of the important upper bound first proved by Holevo
and an explicit expression for another (tighter) upper bound that appears
implicitly in the same derivation. Several upper and lower bounds to the quan-
tum Kullback relative information are derived. The measures developed are also
applied to ferreting out the extent to which quantum systems must be disturbed
by information gathering measurements. This is tackled in two ways. The first
is in setting up a general formalism for describing the tradeoff between
inference and disturbance. The main point of this is that it gives a way of
expressing the problem so that it appears as algebraic as that of the problem
of finding quantum distinguishability measures. The second result on this theme
is a theorem that prohibits &quot;broadcasting&quot; an unknown (mixed) quantum state.
That is to say, there is no way to replicate an unknown quantum state onto two
separate quantum systems when each system is considered without regard to the
other. This includes the possibility of correlation or quantum entanglement
between the systems. This result is a significant extension and generalization
of the standard &quot;no-cloning&quot; theorem for pure states.

their limitations assessed. A quantum channel can recover from arbitrary
decoherence of x qubits if K bits of quantum information are encoded using n
quantum bits, where K/n can be greater than 1-2 H(2x/n), but must be less than
1 - 2 H(x/n). This implies exponential reduction of decoherence with only a
polynomial increase in the computing resources required. Therefore quantum
computation can be made free of errors in the presence of physically realistic

It is
formed by a particular superposition of canonical coherent states. In the
simplest case, these superpositions are eigenfunctions of the annihilation
operator $A=P(d/dx+x)/\sqrt2$, where $P$ is the parity operator. Such $A$
arises naturally in the $q\to -1$ limit for a symmetry operator of a specific
self-similar potential obeying the $q$-Weyl algebra, $AA^\dagger-q^2A^\dagger
A=1$. Coherent states for this and other reflectionless potentials whose
discrete spectra consist of $N$ geometric series are analyzed. In the harmonic
oscillator limit the surviving part of these states takes the form of
orthonormal superpositions of $N$ canonical coherent states
$|\epsilon^k\alpha\rangle$, $k=0, 1, \dots, N-1$, where $\epsilon$ is a
primitive $N$th root of unity, $\epsilon^N=1$. A class of $q$-coherent states
related to the bilateral $q$-hypergeometric series and Ramanujan type integrals
is described. It includes a curious set of coherent states of the free
nonrelativistic particle which is interpreted as a $q$-algebraic system without
discrete spectrum. A special degenerate form of the symmetry algebras of
self-similar potentials is found to provide a natural $q$-analog of the Floquet
theory. Some properties of the factorization method, which is used throughout
the paper, are discussed from the differential Galois theory point of view.

of polarization operator (generalized susceptibility), can be measured on a
finite interval and the high frequency asymptotics (up to a few orders) of
$\Pi$ can be calculated theoretically. In such a case, it is desirable to
derive an equivalent form of the Kramers-Kronig dispersion relation, the
so-called sum rule, in which both the high-frequency part of Im $\Pi$ in the
dispersion integral and the high-order contribution to $\Pi$ are suppressed. We
provide a general framework for derivation of such sum rules, without any
recourse to an infinite-order differential operator. We derive sum rules for a
wide set of weight functions and show that any departure from the $e^{-t}$
behaviour of the weight function in sum rules leads to modulating factors on
the theoretical side of sum rules, providing its low frequency regularization.
We argue that by including modulating factors one can extend the domain of
validity of sum rules further to an intermediate region of frequencies and can
account for ``bumps&quot; which were observed numerically on the phenomenological
side of sum rules at ``intermediate'' frequencies.

initiated by Duru and Kleinert is studied by recognizing it as a special case
of the general treatment of the separable Hamiltonian of Liouville-type. The
basic dynamical principle involved is identified as the Jacobi's principle of
least action for given energy which is reparametrization invariant, and thus
the appearance of a gauge freedom is naturally understood. The separation of
variables in operator formalism corresponds to a choice of gauge in path
integral, and the Green's function is shown to be gauge independent if the
operator ordering is properly taken into account. Unlike the conventional
Feynman path integral,which deals with a space-time picture of particle motion,
the path integral on the basis of the Jacobi's principle sums over orbits in
space. We illustrate these properties by evaluating an exact path integral of
the Green's function for the hydrogen atom in parabolic coordinates, and thus
avoiding the use of the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. In the present
formulation , the Hamiltonian for Stark effect is converted to the one for
anharmonic oscillators with an unstable quartic coupling. We also study the
hydrogen atom path integral from a view point of one-dimensional quantum
gravity coupled to matter fields representing the electron coordinates. A

time. The assumption of instantaneous alternatives in usual quantum mechanics
is an approximation whose validity can be investigated in the generalized
quantum mechanics of closed systems in which probabilities are predicted for
spacetime alternatives that extend over time. In this paper we investigate how
alternatives extended over time reduce to the usual instantaneous alternatives
in a simple model in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show
how the decoherence of a particular set of spacetime alternatives becomes
automatic as the time over which they extend approaches zero and estimate how
large this time can be before the interference between the alternatives becomes
non-negligible. These results suggest that the time scale over which coarse
grainings of such quantities as the center of mass position of a massive body
may be extended in time before producing significant interference is much
longer than characteristic dynamical time scales.

quantum mechanical system is that of a Poisson space with a transition
probability. This is a topological space equipped with a Poisson structure, as
well as with a function $p:P\times P-&gt; [0,1]$, with certain properties. The
Poisson structure is connected with the transition probabilities through
unitarity (in a specific formulation intrinsic to the given context).
  In classical mechanics, where $p(\rho,\sigma)=\dl_{\rho\sigma}$, unitarity
 poses no restriction on the Poisson structure. Quantum mechanics is
characterized by a specific (complex Hilbert space) form of $p$, and by the
property that the irreducible components of $P$ as a transition probability
space coincide with the symplectic leaves of $P$ as a Poisson space. In
conjunction, these stipulations determine the Poisson structure of quantum
mechanics up to a multiplicative constant (identified with Planck's constant).

to require a mind-bogglingly large and perhaps even infinite amount of
information, even if we restrict our attention to a small subsystem such as a
rabbit. In this paper, it is suggested that most of this information is merely
apparent, as seen from our subjective viewpoints, and that the algorithmic
information content of the universe as a whole is close to zero. It is argued
that if the Schr\&quot;odinger equation is universally valid, then decoherence
together with the standard chaotic behavior of certain non-linear systems will
make the universe appear extremely complex to any self-aware subsets that
happen to inhabit it now, even if it was in a quite simple state shortly after
the big bang. For instance, gravitational instability would amplify the
microscopic primordial density fluctuations that are required by the Heisenberg
uncertainty principle into quite macroscopic inhomogeneities, forcing the
current wavefunction of the universe to contain such Byzantine superpositions
as our planet being in many macroscopically different places at once. Since
decoherence bars us from experiencing more than one macroscopic reality, we
would see seemingly complex constellations of stars etc, even if the initial
wavefunction of the universe was perfectly homogeneous and isotropic.

state into the eigenstates of a suitable operator, which we denote as the
``time-of-arrival'' operator. We discuss the general properties of this
operator. We construct the operator explicitly in the simple case of a free
nonrelativistic particle, and compare the probabilities it yields with the ones
estimated indirectly in terms of the flux of the Schr\&quot;odinger current. We
derive a well defined uncertainty relation between time-of-arrival and energy;
this result shows that the well known arguments against the existence of such a
relation can be circumvented. Finally, we define a ``time-representation'' of
the quantum mechanics of a free particle, in which the time-of-arrival is
diagonal. Our results suggest that, contrary to what is commonly assumed,
quantum mechanics exhibits a hidden equivalence between independent (time) and
dependent (position) variables, analogous to the one revealed by the

  applications</title><description>  Despite the seminal connection between classical multiply-periodic motion and
Heisenberg matrix mechanics and the massive amount of work done on the
associated problem of semiclassical (EBK) quantization of bound states, we show
that there are, nevertheless, a number of previously unexploited aspects of
this relationship that bear on the quantum-classical correspondence. In
particular, we emphasize a quantum variational principle that implies the
classical variational principle for invariant tori. We also expose the more
indirect connection between commutation relations and quantization of action
variables. With the help of several standard models with one or two degrees of
freedom, we then illustrate how the methods of Heisenberg matrix mechanics
described in this paper may be used to obtain quantum solutions with a modest
increase in effort compared to semiclassical calculations. We also describe and
apply a method for obtaining leading quantum corrections to EBK results.
Finally, we suggest several new or modified applications of EBK quantization.

the indefiniteness of the pointer observable at the conclusion of a measurement
process governed by unitary quantum dynamics. There has been hope to solve this
problem by eliminating idealizations from the characterization of measurement.
We state and prove two `insolubility theorems' that disappoint this hope. In
both the initial state of the apparatus is taken to be mixed rather than pure,
and the correlation of the object observable and the pointer observable is
allowed to be imperfect. In the {\it insolubility theorem for sharp
observables}, which is only a modest extension of previous results, the object
observable is taken to be an arbitrary projection valued measure. In the {\it
insolubility theorem for unsharp observables}, which is essentially new, the
object observable is taken to be a positive operator v alued measure. Both
theorems show that the measurement problem is not the consequence of neglecting
the ever-present imperfections of actual measurements.

conjugation conditions and the electron number are changed. We use a
semiempirical model with the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger type electron-phonon
interactions. In the neutral one-dimensional C60-polymer, electronic structures
change among direct-gap insulators and the metal, depending on the degree of
conjugations. High pressure experiments could observe such pressure-induced
metal-insulator transitions. The C60-polymer doped with one electron per one
molecule is always a metal. The energy difference between the highest-occupied
state and the lowest-unoccupied state of the neutral system becomes smaller
upon doping owing to the polaron effects. When the C60-polymer is doped with
two electrons per one C60, the system is insulating. When the conjugation in
the direction of the polymer chain is smaller, it is a direct-gap insulator.
The energy gap becomes indirect when the conjugation is stronger. We also study
the antiferromagnetic phase of AC60 by using a tight-binding model with
long-range Coulomb interactions. The antiferromagnetism is well described by
the model. The comparison with the photoemission studies shows that the new
band around the Fermi energy of the AC60 phase can be explaind by the extremely
large intrusion of an energy level into the gap of the neutral system. This
indicates that the interaction effects among electrons are important in doped
C60-polymers.

$S_{e}$. It turns out that neither of these quantities depends in any way on
the system $R$, but only on the initial state and dynamical evolution of $Q$.
$F_{e}$ and $S_{e}$ are related to various other fidelities and entropies, and
are connected by an inequality reminiscent of the Fano inequality of classical
information theory. Some insight can be gained from these techniques into the
security of quantum cryptographic protocols and the nature of quantum

(QECC) provide two ways of protecting quantum states from interaction with the
environment. In an EPP, perfectly entangled pure states are extracted, with
some yield D, from a mixed state M shared by two parties; with a QECC, an arbi-
trary quantum state $|\xi\rangle$ can be transmitted at some rate Q through a
noisy channel $\chi$ without degradation. We prove that an EPP involving one-
way classical communication and acting on mixed state $\hat{M}(\chi)$ (obtained
by sharing halves of EPR pairs through a channel $\chi$) yields a QECC on
$\chi$ with rate $Q=D$, and vice versa. We compare the amount of entanglement
E(M) required to prepare a mixed state M by local actions with the amounts
$D_1(M)$ and $D_2(M)$ that can be locally distilled from it by EPPs using one-
and two-way classical communication respectively, and give an exact expression
for $E(M)$ when $M$ is Bell-diagonal. While EPPs require classical communica-
tion, QECCs do not, and we prove Q is not increased by adding one-way classical
communication. However, both D and Q can be increased by adding two-way com-
munication. We show that certain noisy quantum channels, for example a 50%
depolarizing channel, can be used for reliable transmission of quantum states
if two-way communication is available, but cannot be used if only one-way com-
munication is available. We exhibit a family of codes based on universal hash-
ing able toachieve an asymptotic $Q$ (or $D$) of 1-S for simple noise models,
where S is the error entropy. We also obtain a specific, simple 5-bit single-
error-correcting quantum block code. We prove that {\em iff} a QECC results in
high fidelity for the case of no error the QECC can be recast into a form where
the encoder is the matrix inverse of the decoder.

the incident wave exceeds a certain threshold, a soliton-shaped brightening
(darkening) appears on the layer causing diffraction of the wave. Thus the
spontaneously formed transverse pattern can be viewed as a self-induced
nonlinear quantum screen. Attractive or repulsive nonlinearities result in
different phase shifts of the wave function on the screen, which give rise to
quite different diffraction patterns. Among others, the nonlinearity can cause
self-focusing of the incident wave into a ``beam'', splitting in two ``beams'',
single or double traces with suppressed reflection or transmission, etc.

computation remains an entreating but elusive goal, due to the ubiquitous
nature of decoherence. Recent progress in quantum error correction schemes have
given new hope to this field, but thus far, the codes presented in the
literature assume a restricted number of errors and error free encoding,
decoding, and measurement. We investigate a specific scenario without these
assumptions; in particular, we evaluate a scheme to preserve a single quantum
bit against phase damping using a three-qubit encoding based on Shor. By
applying a new formalism which gives simple operators for decoherence and noisy
logic gates, we find the fidelity of the stored qubit as a function of time,
including decoherence which occurs not only during storage but also during
processing. We generalize our results to include any source of error, and
derive an upper limit on the allowable decoherence per timestep. Physically,
our results suggest the feasibility of engineering artificial metastable states
through repeated error correction.

computing unless successful error correction techniques are developed. To this
end, we have discovered a new scheme for perfectly detecting and rejecting the
error caused by loss (amplitude damping to a reservoir at T=0), based on using
a dual-rail representation of a quantum bit. This is possible because (1)
balanced loss does not perform a ``which-path'' measurement in an
interferometer, and (2) balanced quantum nondemolition measurement of the
``total'' photon number can be used to detect loss-induced quantum jumps
without disturbing the quantum coherence essential to the quantum bit. Our
results are immediately applicable to optical quantum computers using single
photonics devices.

against noise and other unwanted interactions in quantum computation and
communication. We develop a general theory of quantum error correction based on
encoding states into larger Hilbert spaces subject to known interactions. We
obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery of an
encoded state after its degradation by an interaction. The conditions depend
only on the behavior of the logical states. We use them to give a recovery
operator independent definition of error-correcting codes. We relate this
definition to four others: The existence of a left inverse of the interaction,
an explicit representation of the error syndrome using tensor products, perfect
recovery of the completely entangled state, and an information theoretic
identity. Two notions of fidelity and error for imperfect recovery are
introduced, one for pure and the other for entangled states. The latter is more
appropriate when using codes in a quantum memory or in applications of quantum
teleportation to communication. We show that the error for entangled states is
bounded linearly by the error for pure states. A formal definition of
independent interactions for qubits is given. This leads to lower bounds on the
number of qubits required to correct $e$ errors and a formal proof that the
classical bounds on the probability of error of $e$-error-correcting codes
applies to $e$-error-correcting quantum codes, provided that the interaction is
dominated by an identity component.

spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs. Interference terms (IT) between such

The parity bit of that $n$-bit string is described by one of two density

distinguish between the two density matrices, e.g., in terms of optimal mutual

information-theoretic description of quantum entanglement. In a consistent
quantum information theory of entanglement, entropies (uncertainties)
conditional on measurement outcomes can be negative, implying that measurement
can be described via unitary, entropy-conserving, interactions, while still
producing randomness in a measurement device. In such a framework, quantum
measurement is not accompanied by a wave-function collapse, or a quantum jump.
The theory is applied to the measurement of incompatible variables, giving rise
to a stronger entropic uncertainty relation than heretofore known. It is also
applied to standard quantum measurement situations such as the Stern-Gerlach
and double-slit experiments to illustrate how randomness, inherent in the
conventional quantum probabilities, arises in a unitary framework. Finally, the
present view clarifies the relationship between classical and quantum concepts.

impossible. A futher difficulty is that inaccuracies in quantum state
transformations throughout the computation accumulate, rendering the output of
long computations unreliable. It was previously known that a quantum circuit

The kinetic equation is derived without using the so called rotating-wave

  Computers</title><description>  Quantum computers are important examples of processes whose evolution can be
described in terms of iterations of single step operators or their adjoints.
Based on this, Hamiltonian evolution of processes with associated step
operators $T$ is investigated here. The main limitation of this paper is to
processes which evolve quantum ballistically, i.e. motion restricted to a
collection of nonintersecting or distinct paths on an arbitrary basis. The main
goal of this paper is proof of a theorem which gives necessary and sufficient
conditions that T must satisfy so that there exists a Hamiltonian description
of quantum ballistic evolution for the process, namely, that T is a partial
isometry and is orthogonality preserving and stable on some basis. Simple
examples of quantum ballistic evolution for quantum Turing machines with one
and with more than one type of elementary step are discussed. It is seen that
for nondeterministic machines the basis set can be quite complex with much
entanglement present. It is also proved that, given a step operator T for an
arbitrary deterministic quantum Turing machine, it is decidable if T is stable
and orthogonality preserving, and if quantum ballistic evolution is possible.
The proof fails if T is a step operator for a nondeterministic machine. It is
an open question if such a decision procedure exists for nondeterministic
machines. This problem does not occur in classical mechanics.

finite state models in discrete spacetime. Quantum cellular automata, in
particular, are tightly constrained. In previous work we proved a simple No-go
Theorem which precludes nontrivial homogeneous evolution for linear quantum
cellular automata. Here we carefully define general quantum cellular automata
in order to investigate the possibility that there be nontrivial homogeneous
unitary evolution when the local rule is nonlinear. Since the unitary global
transition amplitudes are constructed from the product of local transition
amplitudes, infinite lattices require different treatment than periodic ones.
We prove Unitarity Theorems for both cases, expressing the equivalence in $1+1$
dimensions of global unitarity and certain sets of constraints on the local
rule, and then show that these constraints can be solved to give a variety of
multiparameter families of nonlinear quantum cellular automata. The Unitarity
Theorems, together with a Surjectivity Theorem for the infinite case, also
imply that unitarity is decidable for one dimensional cellular automata.

protocols for bit commitment and coin tossing. However, we, and independently
Mayers, showed that all proposed quantum bit commitment (and therefore coin
tossing) schemes are, in principle, insecure because the sender, Alice, can
always cheat successfully by using an EPR-type of attack and delaying her
measurements. One might wonder if secure quantum bit commitment and coin
tossing protocols exist at all. Here we prove that an EPR-type of attack by
Alice will, in principle, break {\em any} realistic quantum bit commitment and
{\em ideal} coin tossing scheme. Therefore, provided that Alice has a quantum
computer and is capable of storing quantum signals for an arbitrary length of
time, all those schemes are insecure. Since bit commitment and coin tossing are
useful primitives for building up more sophisticated protocols such as
zero-knowledge proofs, our results cast very serious doubt on the security of
quantum cryptography in the so-called ``post-cold-war'' applications.

which classical orbits and path integrals for the motion of a point particle in
flat space can be transformed correctly into those in curved space. This
procedure evolved from well established methods in the theory of plastic
deformations where crystals with defects are described mathematically by
applying nonholonomic coordinate transformations to ideal crystals. In the
context of time-sliced path integrals, there seems to exists a quantum
equivalence principle which determines the measures of fluctating orbits in
spaces with curvature and torsion. The nonholonomic transformations produce a
nontrivial Jacobian in the path measure which in a curved space produces
 an additional term proportional to the curvature scalar canceling a similar
term found earlier by DeWitt from a naive formulation of Feynman's time-sliced
path integral. This cancelation is important in correctly describing
semiclassically and quantum mechanically various systems such as the hydrogen
atom, a particle on the surface of a sphere, and a spinning top. It is also
indispensible for the process of bosonization, by which Fermi particles are
redescribed in terms of Bose fields.

non-relativistic quantum mechanics as a stochastic theory. The sample space
corresponds to a decomposition, as a sum of orthogonal projectors, of the
identity operator on a Hilbert space of histories. Provided a consistency
condition is satisfied, the corresponding Boolean algebra of histories, called
a {\it framework}, can be assigned probabilities in the usual way, and within a
single framework quantum reasoning is identical to ordinary probabilistic
reasoning. A refinement rule, which allows a probability distribution to be
extended from one framework to a larger (refined) framework, incorporates the
dynamical laws of quantum theory. Two or more frameworks which are incompatible
because they possess no common refinement cannot be simultaneously employed to
describe a single physical system.

we derive an inversion formula for the space variable $x$ as a function of the

relates $x$, the prepotential ${\cal F}$, and the probability density. We
invert the Schr\&quot;odinger equation to a third-order differential equation for
${\cal F}$ and observe that the inversion procedure implies a $x$-$\psi$
duality. This phenomenon is related to a modular symmetry due to the
superposition of the solutions of the Schr\&quot;odinger equation. We propose that
in quantum mechanics the space coordinate can be interpreted as a macroscopic
variable of a statistical system with $\hbar$ playing the role of a scaling
parameter. We show that the scaling property of the space coordinate with
respect to $\tau=\partial_{\psi}^2{\cal F}$ is determined by the
``beta-function''. We propose that the quantization of the inversion formula
is a natural way to quantize geometry. The formalism is extended to higher
dimensions and to the Klein-Gordon equation.

The approximation is excellent in the adiabatic regime and up to the extreme
nonadiabatic limit. In particular, the range of validity for this approximation
extends farther into the nonadiabatic regime than for the linear Landau-Zener
result. This method also allows calculation of the source- and
detector-dependent terms in the unaveraged survival probability, and analytic
results for these terms are given. These interference terms may be important in

confined initially in a finite region of space, extending our analysis given
recently (Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 337 (1995)). For this purpose, we solve exactly
the time-dependent Schroedinger equation for a finite-range potential. We
calculate and compare two quantities: (i) the survival probability S(t), i.e.,
the probability that the particle is in the initial state after a time t; and
(ii) the nonescape probability P(t), i.e., the probability that the particle
remains confined inside the potential region after a time t. We analyze in
detail the resonant and nonresonant decay. In the former case, after a very
short time, S(t) and P(t) decay exponentially, but for very long times they
decay as a power law, albeit with different exponents. For the nonresonant case
we obtain that both quantities differ initially. However, independently of the
resonant and nonresonant character of the initial state we always find a
transition to the ground state of the system which indicates a process of
``loss of memory'' in the decay.

  We show that a density matrix comprised of two (${P}_{\alpha }$ and

decomposition into diagonal form with orthogonal projectors. Only then,
according to axioms of Von Neumann and Fock, can we have probability
interpretation of that density matrix, only then can the diagonal elements be

  Those probabilities on the diagonal are not ${P}_{\alpha }$ and

The bound state--problem is analogous to that of point interactions in the
plane: since a two--dimensional point interaction is never repulsive, there are
$ m $ discrete eigenvalues, $ 1\le m\le N $, the lowest of which is
nondegenerate. On the other hand, due to the presence of the boundary the point
interactions give rise to infinite series of resonances; if the coupling is
weak they approach the thresholds of higher transverse modes. We derive also
spectral and scattering properties for point perturbations in several related
models: a cylindrical surface, both of a finite and infinite heigth, threaded
by a magnetic flux, and a straight strip which supports a potential independent
of the transverse coordinate. As for strips with an infinite number of point
perturbations, we restrict ourselves to the situation when the latter are
arranged periodically; we show that in distinction to the case of a

Application to the Quantum Zeno Effect</title><description>  Short pulses of a probe laser have been used in the past to measure whether a
two-level atom is in its ground or excited state. The probe pulse couples the
ground state to a third, auxiliary, level of the atom. Occurrence or absence of
resonance fluorescence were taken to mean that the atom was found in its ground
or excited state, respectively. In this paper we investigate to what extent
this procedure results in an effective measurement to which the projection
postulate can be applied, at least approximately. We discuss in detail the
complications arising from an additional time development of the two-level
system proper during a probe pulse. We extend our previous results for weak
probe pulses to the general case and show that one can model an ideal
(projection-postulate) measurement much better with a strong than a weak probe
pulse. In an application to the quantum Zeno effect we calculate the slow-down
of the atomic time development under n repeated probe pulse measurements and
determine the corrections compared to the case of n ideal measurements.

from problems that arise from resonant coupling of successive orders in the
perturbation series. Multiple-scale analysis, a powerful and sophisticated
perturbative method that quantitatively analyzes characteristic physical
behaviors occurring on various length or time scales, avoids such problems by
implicitly performing an infinite resummation of the conventional perturbation
series. Multiple-scale perturbation theory provides a good description of the
classical anharmonic oscillator. Here, it is extended to study (1) the
Heisenberg operator equations of motion and (2) the Schr\&quot;odinger equation for
the quantum anharmonic oscillator. In the former case, it leads to a system of
coupled operator differential equations, which is solved exactly. The solution
provides an operator mass renormalization of the theory. In the latter case,
multiple-scale analysis elucidates the connection between weak-coupling
perturbative and semiclassical nonperturbative aspects of the wave function.

paper we first specify a stochastic metric obtained from fluctuations that
propagate with the velocity of light, and then develop the non-Markovian
quantum state diffusion theory required to estimate the resulting decoherence
effects on a model matter interferometer. Both commuting and non-commuting
fluctuations are considered. The effects of the latter are so large that if
they applied to some real atom interferometry experiments they would have
suppressed the observed interference. The model is too crude to conclude that
such fluctuations do not exist, but it does demonstrate that the small

``dynamical Casimir effect'' might provide the driving force behind the
puzzling phenomenon of sonoluminescence. Motivated by that exciting suggestion,
we have computed the static Casimir energy of a spherical cavity in an
otherwise uniform material. As expected the result is divergent; yet a
plausible finite answer is extracted, in the leading uniform asymptotic
approximation. This result agrees with that found using zeta-function
regularization. Numerically, we find far too small an energy to account for the
large burst of photons seen in sonoluminescence. If the divergent result is
retained, it is of the wrong sign to drive the effect. Dispersion does not
resolve this contradiction. In the static approximation, the Fresnel drag term
is zero; on the mother hand, electrostriction could be comparable to the
Casimir term. It is argued that this adiabatic approximation to the dynamical
Casimir effect should be quite accurate.

desirable to measure not merely the square modulus of the spatial wavefunction,
but the entire density matrix, whose phases carry information about momentum
and how pure the state is. An experimental setup is presented which can measure
the density matrix (or equivalently, the Wigner function) of a beam of
identically prepared charged particles to an arbitrary accuracy, limited only
by count statistics and detector resolution. The particles enter into an
electric field causing simple harmonic oscillation in the transverse direction.
This corresponds to rotating the Wigner function in phase space. With a
slidable detector, the marginal distribution of the Wigner function can be
measured from all angles. Thus the phase-space tomography formalism can be used
to recover the Wigner function by the standard inversion of the Radon
transform. By applying this technique to for instance double-slit experiments
with various degrees of environment-induced decoherence, it should be possible
to make our understanding of decoherence and apparent wave-function collapse
less qualitative and more quantitative.

contending with the potentially large number of consistent sets of history
propositions. One possibility is to find a scheme in which a unique set is
selected in some way. However, in this paper we consider the alternative
approach in which all consistent sets are kept, leading to a type of `many
world-views' picture of the quantum theory. It is shown that a natural way of
handling this situation is to employ the theory of varying sets (presheafs) on
the space $\B$ of all Boolean subalgebras of the orthoalgebra $\UP$ of history
propositions. This approach automatically includes the feature whereby
probabilistic predictions are meaningful only in the context of a consistent
set of history propositions. More strikingly, it leads to a picture in which
the `truth values', or `semantic values' of such contextual predictions are not
just two-valued (\ie true and false) but instead lie in a larger logical
algebra---a Heyting algebra---whose structure is determined by the space $\B$
of Boolean subalgebras of $\UP$.

subspace implications. For example, if a particle is confined in a particular
region $R$ of space, then in these theories we can deduce that it is confined
in regions containing $R$. However, subspace implications are generally
violated by versions of quantum theory that assign probabilities to histories,
such as the consistent histories approach. I define here a new criterion,
ordered consistency, which refines the criterion of consistency and has the
property that inferences made by ordered consistent sets do not violate
subspace relations. This raises the question: do the operators defining our
observations form an ordered consistent history? If so, ordered consistency
defines a version of quantum theory with greater predictive power than the
consistent histories formalism. If not, and our observations are defined by a
non-ordered consistent quantum history, then subspace implications are not
generally valid.

of absolute causality scheme preserving Lorentz symmetry. It is related to an
appropriate choice of the synchronization procedure (definition of time). In
this formulation existence of field excitations (tachyons) distinguishes an
inertial frame (privileged frame of reference) via spontaneous breaking of the
so called synchronization group. In this scheme relativity principle is broken
but Lorentz symmetry is exactly preserved in agreement with local properties of
the observed world. It is shown that tachyons are associated with unitary
orbits of Poincar\'e mappings induced from $SO(2)$ little group instead of
$SO(2,1)$ one. Therefore the corresponding elementary states are labelled by
helicity. The cases of the helicity $\lambda = 0$ and $\lambda =
\pm\frac{1}{2}$ are investigated in detail and a corresponding consistent field
theory is proposed. In particular, it is shown that the Dirac-like equation
proposed by Chodos et al., inconsistent in the standard formulation of QFT, can
be consistently quantized in the presented framework. This allows us to treat
more seriously possibility that neutrinos might be fermionic tachyons as it is
suggested by experimental data about neutrino masses.

current, in the ordinary tensorial language-- we obtain the decomposition of
the non-relativistic field velocity into two orthogonal parts: (i) the
&quot;classical part, that is, the 3-velocity w = p/m OF the center-of-mass (CM),
and (ii) the so-called &quot;quantum&quot; part, that is, the 3-velocity V of the motion
IN the CM frame (namely, the internal &quot;spin motion&quot; or zitterbewegung). By
inserting such a complete, composite expression of the velocity into the
kinetic energy term of the non-relativistic classical (i.e., newtonian)
lagrangian, we straightforwardly get the appearance of the so-called &quot;quantum
potential&quot; associated, as it is known, with the Madelung fluid. This result
carries further evidence that the quantum behaviour of micro-systems can be
adirect consequence of the fundamental existence of spin. In the second part
(Sections 3 and 4), we fix our attention on the total 3-velocity v = w + V, it
being now necessary to pass to relativistic (classical) physics; and we show
that the proper time entering the definition of the four-velocity v^mu for
spinning particles has to be the proper time tau of the CM frame. Inserting the
correct Lorentz factor into the definition of v^mu leads to completely new
kinematical properties for v_mu v^mu. The important constraint p_mu v^mu = m,
identically true for scalar particles, but just assumed a priori in all
previous spinning particle theories, is herein derived in a self-consistent
way.

  equations</title><description>  Quantum trajectory methods can be used for a wide range of open quantum
systems to solve the master equation by unraveling the density operator
evolution into individual stochastic trajectories in Hilbert space. This C++
class library offers a choice of integration algorithms for three important
unravelings of the master equation. Different physical systems are modeled by
different Hamiltonians and environment operators. The program achieves
flexibility and user friendliness, without sacrificing execution speed, through
the way it represents operators and states in Hilbert space. Primary operators,
implemented in the form of simple routines acting on single degrees of freedom,
can be used to build up arbitrarily complex operators in product Hilbert spaces
with arbitrary numbers of components. Standard algebraic notation is used to
build operators and to perform arithmetic operations on operators and states.
States can be represented in a local moving basis, often leading to dramatic
savings of computing resources. The state and operator classes are very general
and can be used independently of the quantum trajectory algorithms. Only a
rudimentary knowledge of C++ is required to use this package.

memories and quantum channels require gates with asymptotically zero error to
store or transmit an input quantum state for arbitrarily long times or
distances with fixed error. In this report a method is given which has the
property that to store or transmit a qubit with maximum error $\epsilon$
requires gates with error at most $c\epsilon$ and storage or channel elements
with error at most $\epsilon$, independent of how long we wish to store the
state or how far we wish to transmit it. The method relies on using
concatenated quantum codes with hierarchically implemented recovery operations.
The overhead of the method is polynomial in the time of storage or the distance

exponential localization generally occurs for $\eta$ (a scaled $\hbar$) in the
infinitesimal vicinity of QAR points $\eta_0$. The localization length $\xi_0$

``QAR-localization&quot; is associated in some cases with an integrable limit of the

pseudorandom tight-binding models, exhibiting dynamical localization (DL). By

QAR-localization is an excellent approximation to DL sufficiently close to QAR.
The transition from QAR-localization to DL in a semiclassical regime, as $\eta$

uncertainty relations and this makes possible an essential reduction of the

detectable phase shift are obtained in terms of the Jacobi polynomials. These
expressions are compared with results for some conventional input states, and
some known results for the squeezed input states are reviewed. It is shown that
the phase sensitivity for an interferometer that employs squeezing-producing
active devices (such as four-wave mixers) should be analyzed in two regimes:
(i) fixed input state and variable interferometer, and (ii) fixed
interferometer and variable input state. The behavior of the phase sensitivity
is essentially different in these two regimes. The use of the SU(2) intelligent
states allows us to achieve a phase sensitivity of order $1/\bar{N}$ (where
$\bar{N}$ is the total number of photons passing through the phase shifters of
the interferometer) without adding four-wave mixers. This avoids the duality in
the behavior of the phase sensitivity that occurs for the squeezed input. On
the other hand, the SU(1,1) intelligent states have the property of achieving
the phase sensitivity of order $1/\bar{N}$ in both regimes.

The parameter space of such systems which has the structure of $\xC P^2$ is

the localization time, $ (\hbar / \gamma k T )^{\half}$, where $\gamma$ is the
dissipation and $T$ the temperature of the thermal environment. The
localization time is typically greater than the decoherence time, but much
shorter than the relaxation time, $\gamma^{-1}$. We use this result to show
that the reduced density operator rapidly evolves into a state which is
approximately diagonal in a set of generalized coherent states. We thus
reproduce, using a completely different method, a result we previously obtained
using the quantum state diffusion picture (Phys.Rev. D52, 7294 (1995)). We also
go beyond this earlier result, in that we derive an explicit expression for the
weighting of each phase space localized state in the approximately diagonal
density matrix, as a function of the initial state. For sufficiently long times
it is equal to the Wigner function, and we confirm that the Wigner function is
positive for times greater than the localization time (multiplied by a number

tunneling rate is strongly affected by the magnetic field, such as a complete
suppression by a large parallel magnetic field, an example of the dynamical
localization. In such case a small perpendicular component of the field, or the
dissipation, can enhance the tunneling rate. In the small parallel field and
finite temperatures the tunneling rate is finite. Explicit expressions will be

magnetic field as a dissipative tunneling process, by varying the magnetic
field and the potential one can obtain the dissipative spectral function
between the subohmic $s =0$ and the superohmic $s = \infty$. In combination
with a real dissipative spectral function, the effect of the magnetic field can
map the spectral function from $s $ to $2-s$, with $s&gt;2$ mapping to $ s = 0$,

purely geometrical effect by introducing a {\sl phase space metric structure}.
This produces an ${\cal O}(\hbar)$ modification of the classical equations of
motion reducing at the same time the quantization of an arbitrary Hamiltonian
system to standard procedures. Our analysis is carried out in analogy with the
adiabatic motion of a charged particle in a curved background (the additional
metric structure) under the influence of a universal magnetic field (the
classical symplectic structure). This allows one to picture dynamics in an
unusual way, and reveals a dynamical mechanism that produces the selection of
the right set of physical quantum states.

of several physical qubits. It is constructed in such a way that if one of the
physical qubits is perturbed, for example if it gets entangled with an unknown
environment, there still is enough information encoded in the other physical
qubits to restore the logical qubit, and disentangle it from the environment.
The recovery procedure may consist of the detection of an error syndrome,
followed by the correction of the error, as in the classical case. However, it
can also be performed by means of unitary operations, without having to know
the error syndrome. Since quantum codewords span only a restricted subspace of
the complete physical Hilbert space, the unitary operations that generate
quantum dynamics (that is, the computational process) are subject to
considerable arbitrariness, similar to the gauge freedom in quantum field
theory. Quantum codewords can thus serve as a toy model for investigating the
quantization of constrained dynamical systems.

Bell's inequality (namely, tests that involve several composite systems
simultaneously) may sometimes lead to a violation of Bell's inequality, even if
the latter is satisfied when each composite system is tested separately.

a realistic homodyne measurement is described by a family of operational

characterizes the experimental device and is independent of a specific state of
the measured system. We also derive operational homodyne observables for the

measurement of the photon statistics of a pulsed diode laser. The operational
formulation directly gives the relation between the detected noise and the
intrinsic quantum fluctuations of the measured field. We demonstrate this on
two examples: the operational uncertainty relation for the field quadratures,
and the homodyne detection of suppressed fluctuations in photon statistics.

This model reconciles General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics without the need

DECREASES with growing velocity of the EPR pair of spin-1/2 particles. The

is therefore stronger than standard relativistic phenomena such as the Lorentz

storage. Quantum channels have dual uses: they can be used to transmit known
quantum states which code for classical information, and they can be used in a
purely quantum manner, for transmitting or storing quantum entanglement. We
propose here a definition of the von Neumann capacity of quantum channels,
which is a quantum mechanical extension of the Shannon capacity and reverts to
it in the classical limit. As such, the von Neumann capacity assumes the role
of a classical or quantum capacity depending on the usage of the channel. In
analogy to the classical construction, this capacity is defined as the maximum
von Neumann mutual entropy processed by the channel, a measure which reduces to
the capacity for classical information transmission through quantum channels
(the &quot;Kholevo capacity&quot;) when known quantum states are sent. The quantum mutual
entropy fulfills all basic requirements for a measure of information, and
observes quantum data-processing inequalities. We also derive a quantum Fano
inequality relating the quantum loss of the channel to the fidelity of the
quantum code. The quantities introduced are calculated explicitly for the
quantum &quot;depolarizing&quot; channel. The von Neumann capacity is interpreted within
the context of superdense coding, and an &quot;extended&quot; Hamming bound is derived
that is consistent with that capacity.

that, unlike in Shannon theory, conditional entropies can be negative when
considering quantum entangled systems such as an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair,
which leads to a violation of well-known bounds of classical information
theory. Negative quantum entropy can be traced back to ``conditional'' density
matrices which admit eigenvalues larger than unity. A straightforward
definition of mutual quantum entropy, or ``mutual entanglement'', can also be
constructed using a ``mutual'' density matrix. Such a unified
information-theoretic description of classical correlation and quantum

quantum communication, a state can be transmitted over arbitrary distances with
error $\epsilon$ provided each gate has error at most $c\epsilon$. We discuss a
similar concatenation technique which can be used with fault tolerant networks
to achieve any desired accuracy when computing with classical initial states,
provided a minimum gate accuracy can be achieved. The technique works under
realistic assumptions on operational errors. These assumptions are more general
than the stochastic error heuristic used in other work. Methods are proposed to
account for leakage errors, a problem not previously recognized.

sense, and if so, does quantum randomness or nondeterminism add power? Although
reasonable quantum random sources do not add computational power, the
discussion of quantum randomness naturally leads to several definitions of the
complexity of quantum states. Unlike classical string complexity, both
deterministic and nondeterministic quantum state complexities are interesting.
A notion of \emph{total quantum nondeterminism} is introduced for decision
problems. This notion may be a proper extension of classical nondeterminism.

approximation in quantum mechanics and in the self-consistent mean field
approach to studying the dynamics of quantum fields. In this study, we first
show that any variational approximation to the dynamics of a quantum system
based on the Dirac action principle leads to a classical Hamiltonian dynamics
for the variational parameters. Since this Hamiltonian is generically nonlinear
and nonintegrable, the dynamics thus generated can be chaotic, in distinction
to the exact quantum evolution. We then restrict attention to a system of two
biquadratically coupled quantum oscillators and study two variational schemes,
the leading order large N (four canonical variables) and Hartree (six canonical
variables) approximations. The chaos seen in the approximate dynamics is an
artifact of the approximations: this is demonstrated by the fact that its onset
occurs on the same characteristic time scale as the breakdown of the
approximations when compared to numerical solutions of the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation.

applied laser. We investigate two possible ways to implement qubits, in
metastable optical transitions and in Zeeman sublevels of a stable ground
state, and show that in both cases the numbers that can be factorized are not
large enough to be of practical interest. We also investigate the effect of
quantum error correction on our estimates and show that in realistic systems
the impact of quantum error correction is much smaller than expected. Again no

therefore, leads to a natural description of interaction between quantum and

the inhomogeneous Lorentz group or the affine group. Within the framework of
wavelets, it is possible to define the ``window'' which allows us to introduce
a Lorentz-covariant cut-off procedure. The window plays the central role in
tackling the problem of photon localization. It is possible to make a
transition from light waves to photons through the window. On the other hand,
the windowed wave function loses analyticity. This loss of analyticity can be
measured in terms of entropy difference. It is shown that this entropy
difference can be defined in a Lorentz-invariant manner within the framework of
the wavelet formalism.

We show that the quantum corrections are essentially of two types: unitary and

show that this semiquantal chaos is the mechanism trough which tunneling is

studied in this paper-- have an infinite total energy: therefore, they are not
physically realizable. However, they can be truncated in both space and time

Explicit forms of the negative binomial (multinomial) states are given in terms

systems, such as electromagnetic or acoustic waves, is described. This theory
provides a realization of the theorem of Foias and Nagy; there is a subspace of
the Hilbert space in which the unitary evolution of the system, restricted to
this subspace, is realized as a semigroup. The embedding of the quantum theory
into this structure, carried out by Flesia and Piron, is reviewed. We show how
the density matrix for an effectively pure state can evolve to an effectively
mixed state (decoherence) in this framework. Necessary conditions are given for
the realization of the relation between the spectrum of the generator of the
semigroup and the singularities of the $S$-matrix (in energy representation).
It is shown that these conditions may be met in the Liouville space formulation
of quantum evolution, and in the Hilbert space of relativistic quantum theory.

of &quot;spacetime information&quot; - the information available about a quantum system's
boundary conditions in the various sets of decohering histories it may display
- and investigates its properties. We note here that Hartle's analysis contains
errors which invalidate several of the conclusions. In particular, the proof
that the proposed definition agrees with the standard definition for ordinary
quantum mechanics is invalid, the evaluations of the spacetime information for
time-neutral generalized quantum theories and for generalized quantum theories
with non-unitary evolution are incorrect, and the argument that spacetime
information is conserved on spacelike surfaces in these last theories is
erroneous. We show however that the proposed definition does, in fact, agree
with the standard definition for ordinary quantum mechanics. Hartle's
definition relies on choosing, case by case, a class of fine-grained consistent
sets of histories. We supply a general definition of the relevant class of sets
that agrees with Hartle's definition in the cases explicitly considered and
that generalizes to other cases.

employing a modified de Broglie relation. Formalizing the wave-function $\psi$
in real notation yields internal energy components due to mass oscillations.
The wave-features can then be referred to physical waves of discrete frequency
$\nu$ and the classical dispersion relation $\lambda \nu = u $, complying with
the classical wave equation. Including external potentials yields the
Schr\&quot;odinger equation, which, in this context, is arbitrary due to the
internal energy components. It can be established that the uncertainty
relations are an expression of this, fundamental, arbitrariness. Electrons and
photons can be described by an identical formalism, providing formulations
equivalent to the Maxwell equations. The wave equations of intrinsic particle
properties are Lorentz invariant considering total energy of particles,
although transformations into a moving reference frame lead to an increase of
intrinsic potentials. Interactions of photons and electrons are treated
extensively, the results achieved are equivalent to the results in quantum
theory. Electrostatic interactions provide, a posteriori, a justification for
the initial assumption of electron-wave stability: the stability of electron
waves can be referred to vanishing intrinsic fields of interaction. The concept
finally allows the conclusion that a significant correlation for a pair of spin
particles in EPR--like measurements is likely to violate the uncertainty
relations.

  Non-vacuum Initial States</title><description>  Transition from quantum to semiclassical behaviour and loss of quantum
coherence for inhomogeneous perturbations generated from a non-vacuum initial
state in the early Universe is considered in the Heisenberg and the
Schr\&quot;odinger representations, as well as using the Wigner function. We show
explicitly that these three approaches lead to the same prediction in the limit
of large squeezing (i.e. when the squeezing parameter $|r_k|\to \infty$): each
two-modes quantum state (k, -k) of these perturbations is equivalent to a
classical perturbation that has a stochastic amplitude, obeying a non-gaussian
statistics which depends on the initial state, and that belongs to the
quasi-isotropic mode (i.e. it possesses a fixed phase). The Wigner function is
not everywhere positive for any finite $r_k$, hence its interpretation as a
classical distribution function in phase space is impossible without some
coarse graining procedure. However, this does not affect the transition to
semiclassical behaviour since the Wigner function becomes concentrated near a
classical trajectory in phase space when $|r_k|\to \infty$ even without coarse
graining. Deviations of the statistics of the perturbations in real space from
a Gaussian one lie below the cosmic variance level for the N-particles initial
states with N=N(|k|) but may be observable for other initial states without
statistical isotropy or with correlations between different k modes. As a way
to look for this effect, it is proposed to measure the kurtosis of the angular
fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background temperature.

and required symmetries. The noisy, non-linear term is a unimodular scalar
multiple of the time reversal operator that must be present whenever a
Hamiltonian term in the Schrodinger equation can distinguish the factorized
constituents of an entangled state. The dynamical mechanism involved in the
transformation of entangled into factorized states provides an explanation for
the fact that Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations appear in a time determined
by the response of the measuring device and independent of the distance between
the particles. The dependence on the response time of the measuring device may
be testable through a delay in observing the collapse of mesoscopic
``Schrodinger cat&quot; states in ion traps. It is further shown that there are
situations where a two-particle interaction can induce a non-linear term by
virtue of coupling to decay modes that distinguish factorized constituents of
an entangled state. We show that this should happen in the neutral K-meson
system where the entangled $K_L$ state is pushed slightly in the direction of a
factorized constituent ($K_o$ or $\overline{K_o}$) as a consequence of the fact
that these can be distinguished via the sign of the charged lepton in a
semi-leptonic decay mode. The result is a CP violation that is within 20% of

a single system. Each probe pulse will cause a burst of fluorescence or no
fluorescence. If the probe pulses were strictly ideal measurements, the QZE
would predict periods of fluorescence bursts alternating with periods of no
fluorescence (light and dark periods) which would become longer and longer with
increasing frequency of the measurements. The non-ideal character of the

This class is defined over a field with p elements, so the elementary quantum
particle is not a qubit but a ``qupit''. With our codes, the threshold is about
10^(-6). Hopefully, this paper motivates a search for proper quantum codes with
higher thresholds, at which point quantum computation becomes practical.

fundamental questions in quantum mechanics. Recently, there has been work on
developing a consistent way of including constraints into the phase space path
integral that naturally arises in coherent state quantization. This new
approach has many advantages over other approaches, including the lack of any
Gribov problems, the independence of gauge fixing, and the ability to handle
second-class constraints without any ambiguous determinants. In this paper, I
use this new approach to study some examples of time reparameterization
invariant systems, which are of special interest in the field of quantum
gravity.

(such as decoherence) in the system, without disrupting its unitary evolution.
Quantum error correction suggests the possibility of achieving this, but only
if the recovery network can suppress more noise than it introduces. A general
method of constructing such networks is proposed, which gives a substantial
improvement over previous fault tolerant designs. The construction permits
quantum error correction to be understood as essentially quantum state
synthesis. An approximate analysis implies that algorithms involving very many
computational steps on a quantum computer can thus be made possible.

and it is known that they are as powerful as unrestricted computation. We study
the case where both noise and reversibility are combined and show that the
combined model is weaker than unrestricted computation. In our noisy reversible
circuits, each wire is flipped with probability p each time step, and all the
inputs to the circuit are present in time 0. We prove that any noisy reversible
circuit must have size exponential in its depth in order to compute a function
with high probability. This is tight as we show that any circuit can be
converted into a noise-resistant reversible one with a blow up in size which is
exponential in the depth. This establishes that noisy reversible computation
has the power of the complexity class NC^1.
  We extend this to quantum circuits(QC). We prove that any noisy QC which is
not worthless, and for which all inputs are present at time 0, must have size
exponential in its depth. (This high-lights the fact that fault tolerant QC
must use a constant supply of inputs all the time.) For the lower bound, we
show that quasi-polynomial noisy QC are at least powerful as logarithmic depth
QC, (or QNC^1). Making these bounds tight is left open in the quantum case.

present a simulation of them by a probabalistic classical Turing Machine. We
study the slowdown of the simulation for two cases: (1) sequential quantum
computers, or quantum Turing machines(QTM), and (2) parallel quantum computers,
or quantum circuits. This paper shows that the computational power of decohered
quantum computers depends strongly on the amount of parallelism in the
computation.
  The expected slowdown of the simulation of a QTM is polynomial in time and
space of the quantum computation, for any non zero decoherence rate. This means
that a QTM subjected to any amount of noise is worthless. For decohered quantum
circuits, the situation is more subtle and depends on the decoherence rate,
eta. We find that our simulation is efficient for circuits with decoherence
rate higher than some constant, but exponential for general circuits with
decoherence rate lower than some other constant. Using computer experiments, we
show that the transition from exponential cost to polynomial cost happens in a
short range of decoherence rates, and exhibit the phase transitions in various
quantum circuits.

information during public decision in for example the so-called two-party
secure computation. If this were the case, quantum smart-cards could prevent
fake teller machines from learning the PIN (Personal Identification Number)
from the customers' input. Although such optimism has been challenged by the
recent surprising discovery of the insecurity of the so-called quantum bit
commitment, the security of quantum two-party computation itself remains
unaddressed. Here I answer this question directly by showing that all
``one-sided'' two-party computations (which allow only one of the two parties
to learn the result) are necessarily insecure. As corollaries to my results,
quantum one-way oblivious password identification and the so-called quantum
one-out-of-two oblivious transfer are impossible. I also construct a class of
functions that cannot be computed securely in any ``two-sided'' two-party
computation. Nevertheless, quantum cryptography remains useful in key
distribution and can still provide partial security in ``quantum money''

is based upon the principle that the output of a laser is well-approximated by
a classical wave of fixed intensity and phase. This principle yields four
quantitative conditions which the output of a device must satisfy in order for
that device to be considered a laser. While explaining these requirements, I
analyse the similarities and differences between atom and photon lasers. I show
how these conditions are satisfied first by an idealized photon laser model,

of the interferometric Stern-Gerlach effect are described in terms of a

experiments involving trapped ions are suggested. The results are relevant to

nonlinear susceptibilities, the Hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field is
determined completely by this quantization method. From Heisenberg's equations
we derive Maxwell's equations for the field operators. When the nonlinearity

quantization procedure for linear inhomogeneous media [Phys. Rev. A, 43, 467,

possibility of new ways of performing efficient calculations. The most striking
example is the factoring problem. It has recently been shown that computers
that exploit quantum features could factor large composite integers. This task
is believed to be out of reach of classical computers as soon as the number of
digits in the number to factor exceeds a certain limit. The additional power of
quantum computers comes from the possibility of employing a superposition of
states, of following many distinct computation paths and of producing a final
output that depends on the interference of all of them. This ``quantum
parallelism'' outstrips by far any parallelism that can be thought of in
classical computation and is responsible for the ``exponential'' speed-up of
computation.
  This is a non-technical (or at least not too technical) introduction to the
field of quantum computation. It does not cover very recent topics, such as
error-correction.

the evolution of the reduced density matrix in the influence functional
formalism. As examples, we calculate the entropy of two exactly solvable
squeezed systems: an inverted harmonic oscillator and a scalar field mode
evolving in an inflationary universe. For the inverted oscillator with weak
coupling to the bath, at both high and low temperatures, $S\to r $, where r is
the squeeze parameter. In the de Sitter case, at high temperatures, $S\to
(1-c)r$ where $c = \gamma_0/H$, $\gamma_0$ being the coupling to the bath and H
the Hubble constant. These three cases confirm previous results based on more
ad hoc prescriptions for calculating entropy. But at low temperatures, the de
Sitter entropy $S\to (1/2-c)r$ is noticeably different. This result, obtained
from a more rigorous approach, shows that factors usually ignored by the
conventional approaches, i.e., the nature of the environment and the coupling
strength betwen the system and the environment, are important.

localized at the edge of a two-dimensional electron system. For the case of
electrons interacting via the long-range Coulomb interaction, these excitations
are edge magnetoplasmons. We address the time evolution of localized
edge-magnetoplasmon wave packets. On short times the wave packets move along
the edge with classical E cross B drift. We show that on longer times the wave
packets can have properties similar to those of the Rydberg wave packets that
are produced in atoms using short-pulsed lasers. In particular, we show that
edge-magnetoplasmon wave packets can exhibit periodic revivals in which a
dispersed wave packet reassembles into a localized one. We propose the study of
edge-magnetoplasmon wave packets as a tool to investigate dynamical properties
of integer and fractional quantum-Hall edges. Various scenarios are discussed
for preparing the initial wave packet and for detecting it at a later time. We
comment on the importance of magnetoplasmon-phonon coupling and on quantum and

improved understanding of the connection between basic quantum mechanics and
the covalent pair bond. It's focus is on the fact that the energy of the bond
is largely given by the kinetic energy of the electrons, while the Coulomb
forces are only comparable to the kinetic energy terms close to the atomic
nuclei, where they define the shape and the size of the atomic orbitals. If
atomic orbitals are used as a starting point, the kinetic energy operator is
sufficient to determine the energy of the chemical bond. The simple
mathematical structure of this operator allows a calculation of bond energy as
a function of the distance between the atoms. For Gaussian wavefunctions, it is
possible to calculate this bonding potential analytically, determining the bond
length, the bond energy and the elasticity of the bond from only a single
parameter, the width of the atomic wavefunction. It is shown that the results
correspond surprisingly well with experimental values for diatomic molecules.

states are closely linked. States are represented by density matrices $\rho$ on
a Hilbert space and the information-entropy $-tr(\rho\log\rho)$ is
minimised on pure states (pure states are the vertices of the boundary of the
convex set of states). The space of decoherence functions in the consistent
histories approach to generalised quantum theory is also a convex set. However,
by showing that every decoherence function can be written as a convex
combination of two other decoherence functions we demonstrate that there are no
`pure' decoherence functions.
  The main content of the paper is a new notion of information-entropy in
generalised quantum mechanics which is applicable in contexts in which there is
no a priori notion of time. Information-entropy is defined first on consistent
sets and then we show that it decreases upon refinement of the consistent set.
This information-entropy suggests an intrinsic way of giving a consistent set

  Harmonic Oscillator</title><description>  Quantum canonical transformations corresponding to the action of the unitary
operator $e^{i\epsilon(t)\sqrt{f(x)}p\sqrt{f(x)}}$ is studied. It is shown that
for $f(x)=x$, the effect of this transformation is to rescale the position and
momentum operators by $e^{\epsilon(t)}$ and $e^{-\epsilon(t)}$, respectively.
This transformation is shown to lead to the identification of a previously
unknown class of exactly solvable time-dependent harmonic oscillators. It turns
out that the Caldirola-Kanai oscillator whose mass is given by $m=m_0 e^{\gamma
t}$, belongs to this class. It is also shown that for arbitrary $f(x)$, this
canonical transformations map the dynamics of a free particle with constant
mass to that of free particle with a position-dependent mass. In other words,
they lead to a change of the metric of the space.

of quantum mechanics is given within the context of a geometric theory of
gravitation and electromagnetism. While the geometric model shares the
essential principles of the causal interpretation initiated by de Broglie and
advanced by Vigier, the particle and wave components of the theory are derived
from the Einstein equations rather than a nonlinear wave equation. This
geometric approach leads to several new features, including a solution to the

integrals for the motion of a point particle in flat space can be transformed
directly into those in curved space with torsion. Our procedure evolved from
well-established methods in the theory of plastic deformations, where crystals
with defects are described mathematically as images of ideal crystals under
active nonholonomic coordinate transformations.
  Our mapping procedure may be viewed as a natural extension of Einstein's
famous equivalence principle. When applied to time-sliced path integrals, it
gives rise to a new &quot;quantum equivalence principle&quot; which determines short-time
action and measure of fluctuating orbits in spaces with curvature and torsion.
The nonholonomic transformations possesses a nontrivial Jacobian in the path
measure which produces in a curved space an additional term proportional to the
curvature scalar R, thus canceling a similar term found earlier by DeWitt. This
cancelation is important for correctly describing semiclassically and quantum
mechanically various systems such as the hydrogen atom, a particle on the
surface of a sphere, and a spinning top. It is also indispensable for the
process of bosonization, by which Fermi particles are redescribed by those
fields.

mechanics, a reasonable irreversible quantum mechanics can be obtained. This
theory has a more general spectral decompositions, with eigenvectors
corresponding to unstable states that vanish when $t \to \infty .$ These
''Gamov vectors'' have zero norm, in such a way that the norm and the energy of
the physical states remain constant. The evolution operator has no inverse,
showing that we are really dealing with a time-asymmetric theory. Using
Friedrichs model reasonable physical results are obtained, e. g. : the
remaining of an unstable decaying state reappears, in the continuous spectrum
of the model, with its primitive energy.

Barron. They demonstrated that the Jeffreys' invariant prior of Bayesian theory
yields the common asymptotic (minimax and maximin) redundancy - the excess of
the encoding cost over the source entropy - of universal data compression in a
parametric setting. We study certain probability distributions for the
two-level quantum systems. We are able to compute exact formulas for the
corresponding redundancies, for which we find the asymptotic limits. These
results are very suggestive and do indeed point towards a possible quantum
extension of the result of Clarke and Barron.

computers to solve certain problems, such as prime factorization, which are
intractable to date on classical computers. The chances for practical
implementation, however, are limited by decoherence, in which the effect of an
external environment causes random errors in the quantum calculation. To combat
this problem, quantum error correction schemes have been proposed, in which a
single quantum bit (qubit) is ``encoded'' as a state of some larger number of
qubits, chosen to resist particular types of errors. Most such schemes are
vulnerable, however, to errors in the encoding and decoding itself. We examine
two such schemes, in which a single qubit is encoded in a state of $n$ qubits
while subject to dephasing or to arbitrary isotropic noise. Using both
analytical and numerical calculations, we argue that error correction remains
beneficial in the presence of weak noise, and that there is an optimal time
between error correction steps, determined by the strength of the interaction
with the environment and the parameters set by the encoding.

approach to the evolution of the parameters that define the state. The
stability of the solutions is studied. The second aim is to apply these
techniques to the study of the stability of minisuperspace solutions in field
theory. For a $\lambda \varphi^4$ theory we show, both by means of perturbation

binary linear code with similar error-correcting capabilities, thereby
demonstrating new connections between quantum codes and classical codes. Using
this result -- which applies to degenerate as well as nondegenerate codes --
previously established necessary conditions for classical linear codes can be
easily translated into necessary conditions for quantum stabilizer codes.
Examples of specific consequences are: for a quantum channel subject to a
delta-fraction of errors, the best asymptotic capacity attainable by any
stabilizer code cannot exceed H(1/2 + sqrt(2*delta*(1-2*delta))); and, for the
depolarizing channel with fidelity parameter delta, the best asymptotic
capacity attainable by any stabilizer code cannot exceed 1-H(delta).
