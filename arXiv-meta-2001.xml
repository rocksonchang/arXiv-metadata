Holevo's theorem rules out the possibility of communicating more than n bits of
classical information by the transmission of n quantum bits --- unless the two
parties are entangled, in which case twice as many classical bits can be
communicated but no more. In apparent contradiction, there are distributed
computational tasks for which quantum communication cannot be simulated
efficiently by classical means. In extreme cases, the effect of transmitting
quantum bits cannot be achieved classically short of transmitting an
exponentially larger number of bits.
  In a similar vein, can entanglement be used to save on classical
communication? It is well known that entanglement on its own is useless for the
transmission of information. Yet, there are distributed tasks that cannot be
accomplished at all in a classical world when communication is not allowed, but
that become possible if the non-communicating parties share prior entanglement.
This leads to the question of how expensive it is, in terms of classical
communication, to provide an exact simulation of the spooky power of
entanglement.

  Numbers</title><description>  It is shown that in two-state quantum theory, a generic quantum state can be
described by a non-computable real number. In terms of this, the criterion for
measurement outcome is simply and deterministically defined. This demonstration
is based on a construction of the Riemann sphere whose points represent, not
complex numbers, but divergent sequences with bivalent elements. Complex
structure arises from self-similar properties of a set of operators which
generate these sequences. In general, a rotation of (the coordinates of) the
sphere maps a computable real to a non-computable real. This is interpreted
physically as a mapping of a physically-measurable state to a counterfactual
state. Implications for non-locality, null measurements, many worlds and so on,
are discussed. The possible role of the Euler equation as the counterpart of
the Schrodinger equation for real-number quantum state evolution is also
outlined.

particle with arbitrary spin and with magnetic moment moving in a rotating
magnetic field. By using a time-dependent unitary transformation, the
Schr\&quot;odinger equation with the time-dependent Hamiltonian can be reduced to a
Schr\&quot;odinger-like equation with a time-independent effective Hamiltonian.
Eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian correspond to cyclic solutions of the
original Schr\&quot;odinger equation. The nonadiabatic geometric phase of a cyclic
solution can be expressed in terms of the expectation value of the component of
the total angular momentum along the rotating axis, regardless of whether the
solution is explicitly available. For the alkaline atomic electron and a strong
magnetic field, the eigenvalue problem of the effective Hamiltonian is
completely solved, and the geometric phase turns out to be a linear combination
of two solid angles. For a weak magnetic field, the same problem is solved
partly. For a general charged particle, the problem is solved approximately in
a slowly rotating magnetic field, and the geometric phases are also calculated.

  of the Schr\&quot;odinger Equation</title><description>  We introduce the notion of the geometrically equivalent quantum systems
(GEQS) as quantum systems that lead to the same geometric phases for a given
complete set of initial state vectors. We give a characterization of the GEQS.
These systems have a common dynamical invariant, and their Hamiltonians and
evolution operators are related by symmetry transformations of the invariant.
If the invariant is $T$-periodic, the corresponding class of GEQS includes a
system with a $T$-periodic Hamiltonian. We apply our general results to study
the classes of GEQS that include a system with a cranked Hamiltonian
$H(t)=e^{-iKt}H_0e^{iKt}$. We show that the cranking operator $K$ also belongs
to this class. Hence, in spite of the fact that it is time-independent, it
leads to nontrivial cyclic evolutions and geometric phases. Our analysis allows
for an explicit construction of a complete set of nonstationary cyclic states
of any time-independent simple harmonic oscillator. The period of these cyclic
states is half the characteristic period of the oscillator.

transverse eigenvectors and commuting components [Phys. Rev. A 59, 954 (1999)]
to body rotations described by three Euler angles. The axial angle can be made
a function of the two polar angles, and different choices of the functional
dependence are analogous to different gauges of a magnetic field. Symmetries
broken by a choice of gauge are re-established by transformations within the
gauge group. The approach allows several previous proposals to be related.
Because of the coupling of the photon momentum and spin, our position operator,
like that proposed by Pryce, is a matrix that does not commute with the spin
operator. Unlike the Pryce operator, however, our operator has commuting
components, but the commutators of these components with the total angular
momentum require an extra term to rotate the matrices for each vector component
around the momentum direction. Several proofs of the nonexistence of a photon
position operator with commuting components are based on overly restrictive
premises that do not apply here.

(employing complex Hilbert spaces, Hermitean operators, and the trace rule for
calculating probabilities). In this paper it is shown that quantum theory can
be derived from five very reasonable axioms. The first four of these are
obviously consistent with both quantum theory and classical probability theory.
Axiom 5 (which requires that there exists continuous reversible transformations
between pure states) rules out classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 (or
even just the word &quot;continuous&quot; from Axiom 5) is dropped then we obtain
classical probability theory instead. This work provides some insight into the
reasons quantum theory is the way it is. For example, it explains the need for
complex numbers and where the trace formula comes from. We also gain insight
into the relationship between quantum theory and classical probability theory.

including a measurement of a qubit state in quantum computation. The
measurement takes place through the interaction of a single spin with a
quasi-classical cantilever, modeled by a quantum oscillator in a coherent state

rigorously within the framework of the Schr\&quot;odinger equation, without any
artificial assumptions. Computer simulations of the spin-cantilever dynamics,
where the spin is continuously rotated by means of cyclic adiabatic inversion,
show that the cantilever evolves into a Schr\&quot;odinger-cat state: the

peaks that quasi-periodically appear and vanish. For a many-spin system our
equations reduce to the classical equations of motion, and we accurately
describe conventional MRFM experiments involving cyclic adiabatic inversion of
the spin system. We surmise that the interaction of the cantilever with the

discrete Hilbert space representation of quantum mechanical Green's operators.
We have shown that if in some discrete Hilbert space basis representation the
Hamiltonian takes an infinite symmetric tridiagonal, i.e. Jacobi-matrix form
the corresponding Green's matrix can be calculated on the whole complex energy
plane by a continued fraction. The procedure necessitates only the analytic
calculation of the Hamiltonian matrix elements, which are used to construct the
coefficients of the continued fraction. This continued fraction representation
of the Green's operator was shown to be convergent for the bound state energy
region. The theory of analytic continuation of continued fractions was utilized
to extend the representation to the whole complex energy plane. The presented
method provides a simple, easily applicable and analytically correct recipe for
calculating discrete basis representation of Green's operators.

interferometer, in which electrons travelling through an Aharonov-Bohm ring
incorporating a quantum dot in one of the arms are dephased by an interaction
with the fundamental flexural mode of a radio frequency cantilever. The
cantilever is positioned so that its tip lies just above the dot and a bias is
applied so that an electric field exists between the dot and the tip. This
electric field is modified when an additional electron hops onto the dot,
coupling the flexural mode of the cantilever and the microscopic electronic
degrees of freedom. We analyze the transmission properties of this system and
the dependence of interference fringe visibility on the cantilever-dot coupling
and on the mechanical properties of the cantilever. The fringes are
progressively destroyed as the interaction with the cantilever is turned up, in
part due to dephasing arising from the entanglement of the electron and
cantilever states and also due to the thermal smearing that results from
fluctuations in the state of the cantilever. When the dwell time of the
electron on the dot is comparable to or longer than the cantilever period, we
find coherent features in the transmission amplitude. These features are washed
out when the cantilever is decohered by its coupling to the environment.

  according to stochastic electrodynamics</title><description>  The idea about a quantum nature of Planck's blackbody radiation law is deeply
rooted in minds of most physicists. Einstein's work, in which the coefficients
of spontaneous and induced emission were introduced, has always been regarded
as a proof that quantum energy discreteness of an atom plays a crucial role in
the derivation of this law. In our paper we avoid this standpoint. It may be
shown that the de Broglie wave assigned to every material particle is a result
of interaction of the particle with zero-point vibrations of electromagnetic
ground field. The energetic spectrum of a harmonic oscillator is obtained from
this fact within classical physics which coincides with the quantum result.
Thus, it is explained here how the energy discreteness came into existence in
stochastic electrodynamics (SED) --- the classical electrodynamics with
classical electromagnetic zero-point radiation. Next we reconsider the Einstein
work from the viewpoint of SED and derive the Planck formula.

principles underlying gauge field theories. I shall argue that there are two
principles directly connected to the two well-known theorems of Emmy Noether
concerning global and local symmetries of the free matter-field Lagrangian, in
the following referred to as &quot;conservation principle&quot; and &quot;gauge principle&quot;.
Since both these express nothing but certain symmetry features of the free
field theory, they are not sufficient to derive a true interaction coupling to
a new gauge field. For this purpose it is necessary to advocate a third, truly
empirical principle which may be understood as a generalization of the
equivalence principle. The second task of the paper is to deal with the
ontological question concerning the reality status of gauge potentials in the
light of the proposed logical structure of gauge theories. A nonlocal
interpretation of topological effects in gauge theories and, thus, the
non-reality of gauge potentials in accordance with the generalized equivalence
principle will be favoured.

zero sum amplitude (ZSA) multipartite, pure entangled states for qubits and
study their salient features. Using shared-ZSA state, local operation and

  Measurements</title><description>  We show that quantum mechanics predicts an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox
(EPR), and also a contradiction with local hidden variable theories, for photon
number measurements which have limited resolving power, to the point of
imposing an uncertainty in the photon number result which is macroscopic in
absolute terms. We show how this can be interpreted as a failure of a new, very
strong premise, called macroscopic local realism. We link this premise to the
Schrodinger-cat paradox. Our proposed experiments ensure all fields incident on
each measurement apparatus are macroscopic. We show that an alternative
measurement scheme corresponds to balanced homodyne detection of quadrature
phase amplitudes. The implication is that where either EPR correlations or
failure of local realism is predicted for continuous variable (quadrature phase
amplitude) measurements, one can perform a modified experiment which would lead
to conclusions about the much stronger premise of macroscopic local realism.

  continuous variable entanglement: a definitive signature of a Schr\&quot;odinger
  cat</title><description>  In the Schr\&quot;odinger-cat gedanken experiment a cat is in a quantum
superposition of two macroscopically distinct states, alive and dead.The
paradoxical interpretation of quantum mechanics is that the cat is not in one
state or the other, alive or dead, immediately prior to its measurement.
Because of this apparent defiance of macroscopic reality, quantum
superpositions of states macroscopically distinct have generated much interest.
Here we address the issue of proving a contradiction with macroscopic reality
objectively, through the testable predictions of quantum mechanics. We consider
the premises of macroscopic reality (that the ``cat'' is either ``dead'' or
``alive'', the measurement indicating which) and macroscopic locality (that
simultaneous measurements some distance away cannot induce the macroscopic
change, ``dead'' to ``alive'' and vice versa, to the ``cat''). The predictions
of quantum mechanics for certain states, generated using states exhibiting
continuous variable entanglement, are shown to be incompatible with the
predictions of all theories based on this dual premise. Our proof is along the
lines of Bell's theorem, but where all relevant measurements give
macroscopically distinct results.

state of a scalar field in a two-dimensional spacetime. Describing the
scattering upon the mirrors by transmittivity and reflectivity functions
obeying unitarity, causality and high frequency transparency conditions, we
compute the fluctuations of the Casimir forces exerted upon the two motionless
mirrors. We use the linear response theory to derive the motional forces
exerted upon one mirror when it moves or when the other one moves. We show that
these forces may be resonantly enhanced at the frequencies corresponding to the
cavity modes. We interpret them as the mechanical consequence of generation of
squeezed fields.

distinct quantum states in a system of two-level atoms interacting with a
thermal environment of photon modes. We show that the atomic coherent states
are robust against decoherence, therefore we call their superpositions atomic
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger cat states. The initial fast regime of the time evolution is
associated with the process of decoherence, and it is directed towards the
statistical mixture of the constituent coherent states of the original state
for most of the initial conditions. However, certain superpositions, called
symmetric, exhibit exceptionally slow decoherence. By introducing a new
measure, we generalize the usual decoherence scheme regarding the evolution of
the state to account also for the symmetric case. To stress the fact that the
environment preserves symmetric superpositions much longer than the other
ones,we present Wigner function images of the decoherence of a suitably
oriented four component cat state.

of the $Z$-boson is discussed. For this we use the theory based on time
asymmetric boundary conditions given by Hardy class spaces ${\mathbf \Phi}_-$
and ${\mathbf \Phi}_+$ for prepared in-states and detected out-states
respectively, rather than time symmetric Hilbert space theory. This Hardy class
boundary condition is a mathematically rigorous form of the singular
Lippmann-Schwinger equation. In addition to the rigorous definition of the
Lippmann-Schwinger kets $|[j,{\mathsf s}]^{\pm}&gt;$ as functionals on the spaces
${\mathbf \Phi}_{\mp}$, one obtains Gamow kets $|[j,{\mathsf s}_R]^- &gt;$ with
complex centre-of-mass energy value ${\mathsf s}_R=(M_R-i\Gamma_R/2)^2$. The
Gamow kets have an exponential time evolution given by
$\exp{(-iM_Rt-\Gamma_Rt/2)}$ which suggests that $(M_R,\Gamma_R)$ is the right
definition of the mass and width of a resonance. This is different from the two
definitions of the $Z$-boson mass and width used in the Particle Data Table and
leads to a numerical value of $M_R=(91.1626\pm 0.0031) {\rm GeV}$ from the

the presence of a second scatterer, exhibiting properties expected for a
relative inertia: the mass corrections depend upon the distance between the
mirrors, and each mirror experiences a force proportional to the acceleration
of the other one. When the two mirrors move with the same acceleration, the
mass correction obtained for the cavity represents the contribution to inertia
of Casimir energy. Accounting for the fact that the cavity moves as a stressed
rigid body, it turns out that this contribution fits Einstein's law of inertia

The
introductory part of the review is intended to be accessible to the general
reader. M-theory is an eleven-dimensional quantum theory of gravity which is
believed to underlie all superstring theories. This is the only candidate at
present for a theory of fundamental physics which reconciles gravity and
quantum field theory in a potentially realistic fashion. Evidence for the
existence of M-theory is still only circumstantial---no complete
background-independent formulation of the theory yet exists. Matrix theory was
first developed as a regularized theory of a supersymmetric quantum membrane.
More recently, the theory appeared in a different guise as the discrete
light-cone quantization of M-theory in flat space. These two approaches to
matrix theory are described in detail and compared. It is shown that matrix
theory is a well-defined quantum theory which reduces to a supersymmetric
theory of gravity at low energies. Although the fundamental degrees of freedom
of matrix theory are essentially pointlike, it is shown that higher-dimensional
fluctuating objects (branes) arise through the nonabelian structure of the
matrix degrees of freedom. The problem of formulating matrix theory in a
general space-time background is discussed, and the connections between matrix
theory and other related models are reviewed.

  Unitary and Weyl-Heisenberg groups), acting as a dynamical group on
  noncommuting extended phase space</title><description>  The unitary irreducible representations of the covering group of the Poincare
group P define the framework for much of particle physics on the physical
Minkowski space P/L, where L is the Lorentz group. While extraordinarily
successful, it does not provide a large enough group of symmetries to encompass
observed particles with a SU(3) classification. Born proposed the reciprocity
principle that states physics must be invariant under the reciprocity transform
that is heuristically {t,e,q,p}-&gt;{t,e,p,-q} where {t,e,q,p} are the time,
energy, position, and momentum degrees of freedom. This implies that there is
reciprocally conjugate relativity principle such that the rates of change of
momentum must be bounded by b, where b is a universal constant. The appropriate
group of dynamical symmetries that embodies this is the Canonical group C(1,3)
= U(1,3) *s H(1,3) and in this theory the non-commuting space Q= C(1,3)/
SU(1,3) is the physical quantum space endowed with a metric that is the second
Casimir invariant of the Canonical group, T^2 + E^2 - Q^2/c^2-P^2/b^2 +(2h
I/bc)(Y/bc -2) where {T,E,Q,P,I,Y} are the generators of the algebra of
Os(1,3). The idea is to study the representations of the Canonical dynamical
group using Mackey's theory to determine whether the representations can
encompass the spectrum of particle states. The unitary irreducible
representations of the Canonical group contain a direct product term that is a
representation of U(1,3) that Kalman has studied as a dynamical group for
hadrons. The U(1,3) representations contain discrete series that may be
decomposed into infinite ladders where the rungs are representations of U(3)
(finite dimensional) or C(2) (with degenerate U(1)* SU(2) finite dimensional
representations) corresponding to the rest or null frames.

the effect of the atomic interaction energy, which turns fluctuations in the
condensate atom number into fluctuations in the condensate frequency. These

It is demonstrated that there are two substantially different kinematic ranges:

  Nature</title><description>  Orthodox Copenhagen quantum theory renounces the quest to understand the
reality in which we are imbedded, and settles for practical rules that describe
connections between our observations. Many physicist have believed that this
renunciation of the attempt describe nature herself was premature, and John von
Neumann, in a major work, reformulated quantum theory as theory of the evolving
objective universe. In the course of his work he converted to a benefit what
had appeared to be a severe deficiency of the Copenhagen interpretation, namely
its introduction into physical theory of the human observers. He used this
subjective element of quantum theory to achieve a significant advance on the
main problem in philosophy, which is to understand the relationship between
mind and matter. That problem had been tied closely to physical theory by the
works of Newton and Descartes. The present work examines the major problems
that have appeared to block the development of von Neumann's theory into a
fully satisfactory theory of Nature, and proposes solutions to these problems.

curvatures, using the framework of linear response theory which connects these
fluctuations to dissipation mechanisms arising when stress tensors and
spacetime metric are coupled. Vacuum fluctuations of spacetime curvatures are
shown to be a sum of two contributions at lowest orders; the first one
corresponds to vacuum gravitational waves and is restricted to light-like
wavevectors and vanishing Einstein curvature, while the second one arises from
gravity of vacuum stress tensors. From these fluctuations, we deduce noise
spectra for geodesic deviations registered by probe fields which determine
ultimate limits in length or time measurements. In particular, a relation
between noise spectra characterizing spacetime fluctuations and the number of
massless neutrino fields is obtained.

lithographic image formation on films covering areas larger than a wavelength
squared. For example, it is possible to make a lithographic pattern with a
feature size resolution of $\lambda/[2(N+1)]$ by using a particular $2
M$-photon, multi-mode entangled state, where $N &lt; M$, and banks of birefringent
plates. By preparing a statistically mixed such a state one can form any pixel
pattern on a $(N+1) 2^{M-N} \times (N+1) 2^{M-N}$ pixel grid occupying a square
with a side of $L=2^{M-N-1}$ wavelengths. Hence, there is a trade-off between
the exposed area, the minimum lithographic feature size resolution, and the
number of photons used for the exposure. We also show that the proposed method
will work even under non-ideal conditions, albeit with somewhat poorer
performance.

construct generally an unsorted quantum search algorithm. The exponential
propagator and its corresponding effective Hamiltonian are constructed
explicitly that describe in quantum mechanics the time evolution of a multi-
particle two-state quantum system from the initial state to the output of the
unsorted quantum search problem. The exponential propagator usually may not be
compatible with the mathematical structure and principle of the search problem
and hence is not a real quantum search network, but it can be further
decomposed into a product of a series of the oracle unitary operations such as
the selective phase-shift operations and the nonselective unitary operations
which can be expressed further as a sequence of elementary building blocks such
as one-qubit quantum gates and the two-qubit diagonal phase gates, resulting in
that the decomposed propagator is compatible with the mathematical structure
and principle of the search problem and thus, becomes a real quantum search
network. The decomposition for the propagator can be achieved with the help of
the operator algebra structure and symmetry of the effective Hamiltonian, and
the properties of the multiple-quantum operator algebra spaces, especially the
characteristic transformation behavior of the multiple-quantum operators under
the z-axis rotations. It has been shown that the computational complexity of
the search algorithm is dependent upon that of the numerical multidimensional
integration and hence it is believed that the search algorithm could solve
efficiently the unsorted search problem. An NMR device is also proposed to
solve efficiently the unsorted search problem in polynomial time.

temperature. It is shown that the zero-frequency term of Lifshitz formula has
interpretation problem in the case of real metal described by Drude model. It
happens because the scattering theory underlying Lifshitz formula is not well
formulated when the dielectric permittivity takes account of dissipation. To
give the zeroth term of Lifshitz formula the definite meaning different
prescriptions were used recently by different authors with diversed results.
These results are shown to be improper and in disagreement with experiment and
the general physical requirements. We propose the new prescription which is a
generalization of Schwinger, DeRaad and Milton recipe formulated earlier for
ideal metals. On this base the detailed numerical and analytical computations
of the temperature Casimir force are performed in configuration of two plane
plates and a spherical lens (sphere) above a plate. The corrections due to
nonzero temperature and finite conductivity found in the paper are in agreement
with the limiting case of perfect metal and fit all experimental and
theoretical requirements. Among other facts, the previous results obtained in
frames of plasma model are confirmed. It appears they are the limiting case of
Drude model computations when the relaxation parameter goes to zero. The

  Original Wave Realism and the Universal Schroedinger Equation</title><description>  Following Max Planck's hypothesis of quanta (quant-ph/0012069) and the matter
wave idea of Louis de Broglie (quant-ph/9911107), Erwin Schroedinger proposed,
at the beginning of 1926, the concept of wavefunction and wave equation for it.
Though endowed with a realistic undular interpretation by its father, the
wavefunction could not be considered as a real &quot;matter wave&quot; and has been
provided with only abstract, formally probabilistic interpretation. In this
paper we show how the resulting &quot;mysteries&quot; of usual theory are solved within
the unreduced, dynamically multivalued description of the underlying,
essentially nonlinear interaction process (quant-ph/9902015, quant-ph/9902016),
without artificial modification of the Schroedinger equation. The latter is
rigorously derived instead as universal expression of unreduced interaction
complexity. Causal, totally realistic wavefunction is obtained as a dynamically
probabilistic intermediate state of a simple system with interaction performing
dynamically discrete transitions between its localised, incompatible
&quot;realisations&quot; (&quot;corpuscular&quot; states). Causal wavefunction and Schroedinger
equation are then extended to arbitrary level of world dynamics. We outline
some applications of the obtained causal description, such as genuine quantum
chaos (quant-ph/9511034-36) and realistic quantum devices (physics/0211071),
and emphasize the basic difference of the proposed dynamically multivalued
theory from dynamically single-valued imitations of causality and complexity.
The causally complete wavefunction concept, representing the unified essence of
unreduced (multivalued) complex dynamics, provides a clear distinctive feature
of realistic science, absent in any its unitary imitation.

universal description of the states with integer and half-integer helicity. The
infinite-dimensional representations correspond formally to the massless states
with fractional (real) helicity. The solutions of the latter type, however,
break down the (3+1)$D$ Poincar\'e invariance to the (2+1)$D$ Poincar\'e
invariance, and via a compactification on a circle a consistent theory for
massive anyons in $D$=2+1 is produced. A general analysis of the ``helicity
equation'' shows that the (3+1)$D$ Poincar\'e group has no massless irreducible
representations with the trivial non-compact part of the little group
constructed on the basis of the infinite-dimensional representations of
$sl(2,\CC)$. This result is in contrast with the massive case where integer and
half-integer spin states can be described on the basis of such representations,
and means, in particular, that the (3+1)$D$ Dirac positive energy covariant
equations have no massless limit.

gratings is suggested for the Hamiltonian path problem on a simple graph G of N
vertices. The photon is input to an N-slit grating followed by an N x N matrix
of `processing units'. A unit consists of a delay line followed by a grating
with k slits (0 &lt; k &lt; N) whose outputs are directed to k units in the next row
in a manner determined by the adjacency matrix of G. There is a one-to-one
mapping between paths of length N-1 in the graph and physical paths through the
matrix. The photon's path is a superposition of all these physical paths. The
time taken by the photon along a physical path corresponding to a Hamiltonian
path in G is a fixed value equal to the sum of N distinct delays, and is
different from the time along any other path. The graph is Hamiltonian if any
one of N detectors placed in the output of the N units in row N detects the
photon at this fixed time.

state chosen from the known set of states. We present a principle that gives a
definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the
system and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by
alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a
fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple
form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely
determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the
classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts
depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one
storing it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one
storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is
inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the
state of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning,
no-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general
forms including mixed states. It also gives a unified view on how various
schemes of quantum cryptography work. The principle helps to derive optimum
amount of resources (bits, qubits, and ebits) required in data compression or
in quantum teleportation of mixed-state ensembles.

any unstable quantum state can be inhibited by sufficiently frequent
observations (measurements). The consensus opinion has upheld the QZE as a
general feature of quantum mechanics, which should lead to the inhibition of
any decay. The claim of QZE generality hinges on the assumption that successive
observations can in principle be made at time intervals too short for the
system to change appreciably. However, this assumption and the generality of
the QZE have scarcely been investigated thus far. We have addressed these
issues by showing that (i) the QZE is principally unattainable in radiative or
radioactive decay, because the required measurement rates would cause the
system to disintegrate; (ii) decay acceleration by frequent measurements (the
anti-Zeno effect -- AZE) is much more ubiquitous than its inhibition. The AZE
is shown to be observable as the enhancement of tunneling rates (e.g., for
atoms trapped in ramped-up potentials or in current-swept Josephson junctions),
fluorescence rates (e.g., for Rydberg atoms perturbed by noisy optical fields)
and photon depolarization rates (in randomly modulated Pockels cells).

considered allow a local classical model. All these inequalities can be
summarized in a single, albeit non-linear inequality. We show that quantum
correlations satisfy this condition provided the state has positive partial
transpose with respect to any grouping of the n systems into two subsystems. We
also provide an efficient algorithm for finding the maximal quantum mechanical
violation of each inequality, and show that the maximum is always attained for
the generalized GHZ state.

initial conditions. Quantum mechanics, however, does not show this feature. We
consider instead the sensitivity of quantum evolution to perturbations in the
Hamiltonian. This is observed as an atenuation of the Loschmidt Echo, $M(t)$,
i.e. the amount of the original state (wave packet of width $\sigma$) which is
recovered after a time reversed evolution, in presence of a classically weak
perturbation. By considering a Lorentz gas of size $L$, which for large $L$ is
a model for an {\it unbounded} classically chaotic system, we find numerical
evidence that, if the perturbation is within a certain range, $M(t)$ decays
exponentially with a rate $1/\tau_{\phi}$ determined by the Lyapunov exponent
$\lambda$ of the corresponding classical dynamics. This exponential decay
extends much beyond the Eherenfest time $t_{E}$ and saturates at a time
$t_{s}\simeq \lambda^{-1}\ln (\widetilde{N})$, where $\widetilde{N}\simeq
(L/\sigma)^2$ is the effective dimensionality of the Hilbert space. Since $\tau
_{\phi}$ quantifies the increasing uncontrollability of the quantum phase
(decoherence) its characterization and control has fundamental interest.

quantum systems. We then use them to discuss both the mechanisms causing
decoherence at low $T$, and the dynamics of this decoherence. This is done
first for a central 2-level system coupled to these environments- the results
can be applied to the dynamics of quantum nanomagnets and superconducting
SQUIDs, where large-scale tunneling of magnetisation and flux take place.
Decoherence in these systems is caused principally by coupling to electrons and
nuclear spins, the spin bath couplings are particularly dangerous at low $T$.
  These models are also generalised to discuss quantum measurements in which
the measured system, the measuring apparatus, and the environment are treated
quantum mechanically. The results can be used to calculate the dynamics of
coupled SQUIDs and/or nanomagnets, in which one acts as a measuring apparatus
and the other exhibits large-scale quantum superpositions. The same model can
be used to describe coupled qubits.

implemented by two parties (Alice and Bob) who share entanglement but do not
communicate; it is causal if the superoperator does not convey information from
Alice to Bob or from Bob to Alice. We characterize the general structure of
causal complete measurement superoperators, and exhibit examples that are
causal but not localizable. We construct another class of causal bipartite
superoperators that are not localizable by invoking bounds on the strength of
correlations among the parts of a quantum system. A bipartite superoperator is
said to be semilocalizable if it can be implemented with one-way quantum
communication from Alice to Bob, and it is semicausal if it conveys no
information from Bob to Alice. We show that all semicausal complete measurement
superoperators are semilocalizable, and we establish a general criterion for
semicausality. In the multipartite case, we observe that a measurement
superoperator that projects onto the eigenspaces of a stabilizer code is

Bose-Einstein condensates. A first scheme relies on the 'conveyor belt'
provided by a frequency-chirped optical lattice. For potentials shallow enough
that the condensate is not fragmented, the acceleration can be interpreted in
terms of sequential Bragg scattering, with the atomic sample undergoing
transitions to a succession of discrete momentum sidemodes. The narrow momentum
width of these sidemodes offers the possibility to accelerate an ultracold
atomic sample such as e.g. a Bose-Einstein condensate without change in its
momentum distribution. This is in contrast to classical point particles, for
which this kind of acceleration leads to a substantial heating of the sample. A
second scheme is based on the idea of a synchronous particle accelerator
consisting of a spatial array of quadrupole traps. Pulsing the trapping
potential creates a traveling trap that confines and accelerates the atomic
system. We study this process using the concept of phase stability.

important and the superconducting phase across the link turns into a periodic
quantum variable. Isolated Josephson junction arrays are described in terms of
such periodic quantum variables and thus exhibit pronounced quantum
interference effects arising from paths with different winding numbers
(Aharonov-Casher effects). These interference effects have strong implications
for the excitation spectrum of the array which are relevant in applications of
superconducting junction arrays for quantum computing. The interference effects
are most pronounced in arrays composed of identical junctions and possessing
geometric symmetries; they may be controlled by either external gate potentials
or by adding/removing charge to/from the array. Here we consider a loop of N
identical junctions encircling one half superconducting quantum of magnetic
flux. In this system, the ground state is found to be non-degenerate if the
total number of Cooper pairs on the array is divisible by N, and doubly
degenerate otherwise (after the stray charges are compensated by the gate
voltages).

input list, we prove a lower bound of \frac{1}{\pi}(\ln(N)-1) accesses to the
list elements for ordered searching, a lower bound of \Omega(N\log{N}) binary
comparisons for sorting, and a lower bound of \Omega(\sqrt{N}\log{N}) binary
comparisons for element distinctness. The previously best known lower bounds
are {1/12}\log_2(N) - O(1) due to Ambainis, \Omega(N), and \Omega(\sqrt{N}),
respectively. Our proofs are based on a weighted all-pairs inner product
argument.
  In addition to our lower bound results, we give a quantum algorithm for
ordered searching using roughly 0.631 \log_2(N) oracle accesses. Our algorithm

Mechanics by dividing Quantum Theory in two parts: - General Quantum Axiomatics
(a system is described by a state in a Hilbert space, observables are
self-adjoint operators and so on) - Quantum Mechanics properly that specifies
the Hilbert space, the Heisenberg rule, the free Hamiltonian... We show that
General Quantum Axiomatics (up to a supplementary &quot;axiom of classicity&quot;) can be
used as a non-standard mathematical ground to formulate all the ideas and
equations of ordinary Classical Statistical Mechanics. So the question of a
&quot;true quantization&quot; with &quot;h&quot; must be seen as an independent problem not
directly related with quantum formalism. Moreover, this non-standard
formulation of Classical Mechanics exhibits a new kind of operation with no
classical counterpart: this operation is related to the &quot;quantization process&quot;,
and we show why quantization physically depends on group theory (Galileo
group). This analytical procedure of quantization replaces the &quot;correspondence
principle&quot; (or canonical quantization) and allows to map Classical Mechanics
into Quantum Mechanics, giving all operators of Quantum Mechanics and
Schrodinger equation. Moreover spins for particles are naturally generated,
including an approximation of their interaction with magnetic fields. We find
also that this approach gives a natural semi-classical formalism: some exact
quantum results are obtained only using classical-like formula. So this
procedure has the nice property of enlightening in a more comprehensible way
both logical and analytical connection between classical and quantum pictures.

entanglement at the quantum level and chaos at the classical level arise from
nonseparable couplings between the atomic spin and its center of mass motion.
The main features of the chaotic dynamics are analyzed using action-angle

prepared in current experiments [D. J. Haycock et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85,
3365 (2000)], the classical and quantum dynamics diverge, and the observed
experimental dynamics are best described by quantum mechanics. Furthermore, the

coupling between the spin and the motional subsystems, which are very different
in nature from one another, leads to new questions regarding the transition
from regular quantum dynamics to chaotic classical motion.

Measurements on the two-ion entangled state violates Bell's inequality at the

two-qubit universal quantum logic.

critical current. This effectively lowers the barrier in the double-well
rf-SQUID potential thereby increasing the tunneling oscillation frequency
between the wells. By carefully choosing the time interval between SFQ pulses
one may accelerate the interwell tunneling rate. Thus it is possible to place
the qubit into a chosen superposition of flux states and then effectively to
freeze the qubit state. We present both numerical simulations and analytical
time-dependent perturbation theory calculations that demonstrate the technique.
Using this strategy one may control the quantum state of the rf-SQUID in a way
analogous to the \pi pulses in other qubit schemes. Research supported in part

It is argued that in this way one can generate potentials with more interesting

  Entanglement</title><description>  This paper gives the first formal treatment of a quantum analogue of
multi-prover interactive proof systems. It is proved that the class of
languages having quantum multi-prover interactive proof systems is necessarily
contained in NEXP, under the assumption that provers are allowed to share at
most polynomially many prior-entangled qubits. This implies that, in
particular, if provers do not share any prior entanglement with each other, the
class of languages having quantum multi-prover interactive proof systems is
equal to NEXP. Related to these, it is shown that, in the case a prover does
not have his private qubits, the class of languages having quantum
single-prover interactive proof systems is also equal to NEXP.

  Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  In the framework of SUSYQM extended to deal with non-Hermitian Hamiltonians,

This extends to the complex domain the well-known relationship between SUSYQM

with one known eigenvalue corresponding to a bound state. When the Weierstrass
function degenerates to a hyperbolic one, the imaginary potential becomes PT
non-symmetric and its known eigenvalue corresponds to an unbound state.

developed separately it has emerged that they are in fact intimately related.
In this review I will show how quantum information theory extends traditional
information theory by exploring the limits imposed by quantum, rather than
classical mechanics on information storage and transmission. The derivation of
many key results uniquely differentiates this review from the &quot;usual&quot;
presentation in that they are shown to follow logically from one crucial
property of relative entropy. Within the review optimal bounds on the speed-up
that quantum computers can achieve over their classical counter-parts are
outlined using information theoretic arguments. In addition important
implications of quantum information theory to thermodynamics and quantum
measurement are intermittently discussed. A number of simple examples and
derivations including quantum super-dense coding, quantum teleportation,
Deutsch's and Grover's algorithms are also included.

function in usual coordinates and momenta and a density matrix in the charge

such particles depend on the definition of the coordinate operator. The
evolution equation for the Wigner function of a single-charge state in the
classical limit coincides with the Liouville equation. Localization

computing, principally developed by Bennet [IBM J. Res. Develop., 17(1973)] and
by Fredkin and Toffoli [Internat. J. Theoret. Phys., 21(1982)], to the quantum
case. This is a fundamental step towards the construction of a quantum computer
because a time efficient quantum computation is a reversible physical process.
The paper is organized as follows. The first section reviews the classical
theory of reversible computing. In the second section it is showed that the
designs used in the classical framework to decrease the consumption of space
cannot be generalized to the quantum case; it is also suggested that quantum
computing is generally more demanding of space than classical computing. In the
last section a new model of fully quantum and reversible automaton is proposed.
The computational power of this automaton is at least equal to that of
classical automata. Some conclusion are drawn in the last section.

ideal Bose gas, the order parameter of which, that is, the amplitude of the
condensate, is the pointer variable. It is shown that properties of
irreversibility and ergodicity breaking, which are inherent in the model
apparatus, ensure the appearance of definite results of the measurement, and
provide a dynamical realization of wave-function reduction or collapse. The
measurement process takes place in two steps: First, the reduction of the state
of the tested system occurs over a time of order $\hbar/(TN^{1/4})$, where $T$
is the temperature of the apparatus, and $N$ is the number of its degrees of
freedom. This decoherence process is governed by the apparatus-system
interaction. During the second step classical correlations are established
between the apparatus and the tested system over the much longer time-scale of
equilibration of the apparatus. The influence of the parameters of the model on
non-ideality of the measurement is discussed. Schr\&quot;{o}dinger kittens, EPR

the rest as an environment E. We assume that one does not measure anything of
E, i.e., one is only interested in observables of the subsystems. We show that
there exist states with the following properties: (i) Its reduced density
operator is completely equivalent to a vector state of the subsystems for any
gauge-invariant observable of the subsystems. (ii) The vector state is a simple
product of vector states of individual subsystems, each of which is not an
eigenstate of the charge of each subsystem. Furthermore, one can associate to
each subsystem its vector state, which is a pure state, and observables which
are not necessarily gauge invariant in each subsystem. These results justify
taking (a) superpositions of states with different charges, and (b)
non-gauge-invariant operators, such as the order parameter of the breaking of
the gauge symmetry, as observables, for subsystems.

be achieved efficiently with just one initial pure qubit and a supply of
initally maximally mixed qubits (S. Parker and M. B. Plenio, Phys. Rev. Lett.
85, 3049 (2000)) . This leads us to ask how this affects the entanglement in

algorithm for small numbers of qubits by classical computer simulation of the
quantum computer at different stages of the algorithm. We find that
entanglement is an intrinsic part of the algorithm and that the entanglement
through the algorithm appears to be closely related to the amount of mixing.
Furthermore, if the computer is in a highly mixed state any attempt to remove
entanglement by further mixing of the algorithm results in a significant
decrease in its efficiency.

maximum entanglement varies with the field amplitude. Furthermore, we have
derived a simple rule for the mixing of concurrences (a measure of

a bit error rate of 12.7 percents, by allowing only one-way classical
communications in the error correction/privacy amplification procedure between
Alice and Bob. This shows a clear advantage of the six-state scheme over
another standard scheme---BB84, which has been proven to be secure up to only
about 11 percents, if only one-way classical communications are allowed. Our

Alice and Bob's ability to establish rigorously from their test sample the
non-trivial mutual information between the bit-flip and phase error patterns. A
modified version of the degenerate quantum codes studied by DiVincenzo, Shor

of universal gates (e.g., single-qubit operations and CNOT), we focus on the
intrinsic ability of a system to act as a universal quantum computer using only
its naturally available interactions. A key element of this approach is the
realization that the fungible nature of quantum information allows for
universal manipulations using quantum information encoded in a subspace of the
full system Hilbert space, as an alternative to using physical qubits directly.
Starting with the interactions intrinsic to the physical system, we show how to
determine the possible universality resulting from these interactions over an
encoded subspace. We outline a general Lie-algebraic framework which can be
used to find the encoding for universality and give several examples relevant
to solid-state quantum computing.

amplitudes, are selectively prepared, manipulated, and imaged in
Time-Frequency-Resolved Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (TFRCARS)
measurements using femtosecond laser pulses. The studies are implemented in
iodine vapor, with its thermally occupied statistical ro-vibrational density
serving as initial state. The evolution of the massive ro-vibronic
superpositions, consisting of 1000 eigenstates, is followed through
two-dimensional images. The first- and second-order coherences are captured
using time-integrated frequency-resolved CARS, while the third-order coherence
is captured using time-gated frequency-resolved CARS. The Fourier filtering
provided by time integrated detection projects out single ro-vibronic
transitions, while time-gated detection allows the projection of arbitrary
ro-vibronic superpositions from the coherent third-order polarization. Beside
the control and imaging of chemistry, the controlled manipulation of massive
quantum coherences suggests the possibility of quantum computing. We argue that
the universal logic gates necessary for arbitrary quantum computing - all
single qubit operations and the two-qubit controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate - are
available in time resolved four-wave mixing in a molecule. The molecular
rotational manifold is naturally &quot;wired&quot; for carrying out all single qubit
operations efficiently, and in parallel. We identify vibronic coherences as one
example of a naturally available two-qubit CNOT gate, wherein the vibrational
qubit controls the switching of the targeted electronic qubit.

structured reservoir of quantum EM field modes, with particular relevance to
atoms interacting with the field in high Q cavities or photonic band gap
materials. In cases such as the former, we show that the pseudo mode theory for
single quantum reservoir excitations can be obtained by applying the Fano
diagonalisation method to a system in which the atomic transitions are coupled
to a discrete set of (cavity) quasimodes, which in turn are coupled to a
continuum set of (external) quasimodes with slowly varying coupling constants
and continuum mode density. Each pseudomode can be identified with a discrete
quasimode, which gives structure to the actual reservoir of true modes via the
expressions for the equivalent atom-true mode coupling constants. The quasimode
theory enables cases of multiple excitation of the reservoir to now be treated
via Markovian master equations for the atom-discrete quasimode system.
Applications of the theory to one, two and many discrete quasimodes are made.
For a simple photonic band gap model, where the reservoir structure is
associated with the true mode density rather than the coupling constants, the
single quantum excitation case appears to be equivalent to a case with two
discrete quasimodes.

with the time-dependent Hamiltonian can be reduced to a Dirac-like equation
with a time-independent effective Hamiltonian. Eigenstates of the effective
Hamiltonian correspond to cyclic solutions of the original Dirac equation. The
nonadiabatic geometric phase of a cyclic solution can be expressed in terms of
the expectation value of the component of the total angular momentum along the
rotating axis, regardless of whether the solution is explictly available. For a
slowly rotating magnetic field, the eigenvalue problem of the effective
Hamiltonian is solved approximately and the geometric phases are calculated.
The same problem for a charged or neutral Dirac particle with an anomalous
magnetic moment is discussed briefly.

as the $a\to 0$ limit of $\Omega\hbar^2\delta(r-a)/2\mu r^\alpha$. It is
surprising that it gives a nonvanishing cross section when $\alpha=1$ and
$\Omega=-1$. When the contact potential is approached by a spherical square

violated in these simulations. The violation depends crucially on the threshold
of the polarizer switches and can reach a value of 2.0 in the limiting case.
Existing experiments can be fully accounted for by limited coherence and
non-ideal detector switches. It seems thus safe to conclude that the Bell

  Potentials</title><description>  We examine the passage of ultra-cold two-level atoms through the potential
produced by the vacuum of the cavity field. The peak of the transmitted wave
packet generally occurs at the instant given by the expression for phase time
even if that instant is earlier than the instant at which incident wave
packet's peak enters the cavity and thus the phase time can be considered as
the appropriate measure of the time required for the atom to traverse the
cavity. We show that the phase tunneling time for ultra-cold atoms could be
both super - and sub - classical time and we show how this behaviour can be
understood in terms of the momentum dependence of the phase of transmission
amplitude. The passage of the atom through the cavity is unique as it involves
a coherent addition of the transition amplitudes corresponding to both barrier
and well. New features such as the splitting of the wave packet arise from the
entanglement between the center of mass motion and the electronic as well as
field states in the cavity.

Modern
digital computers use bits as the building blocks, but in general the choice of
building blocks depends on the nature of the information to be encoded. What
are the optimal building blocks to encode structural information? This can be
analysed by substituting the operations of addition and multiplication of
conventional arithmetic with translation and rotation. It is argued that at the
molecular level, the best component for encoding discretised structural
information is carbon. Living organisms discovered this billions of years ago,
and used carbon as the back-bone for constructing proteins that function
according to their structure. Structural analysis of polypeptide chains shows
that an efficient and versatile structural language of 20 building blocks is
needed to implement all the tasks carried out by proteins. Properties of amino
acids indicate that the present triplet genetic code was preceded by a more
primitive one, coding for 10 amino acids using two nucleotide bases.

  It turns out that a measurement of the observable A and an implementation of

generate different ordering in the set of pure states and for some states their
ordering depends on the measure of entanglement used. This odd-looking property
is acceptable, since these incomparable states cannot be transformed to each

dimensions is of the order of de Broglie wavelength for cold electrons. By
using semiconductors, composed of more than one material combined with a metal
slip-gate, two-dimensional quantum tubes may be built. We present a method for
predicting the transmission of low-temperature electrons in such a tube. This
problem is mathematically related to the transmission of acoustic or
electromagnetic waves in a two-dimensional duct. The tube is asymptotically
straight with a constant cross-section. Propagation properties for complicated
tubes can be synthesised from corresponding results for more simple tubes by
the so-called Building Block Method. Conformal mapping techniques are then
applied to transform the simple tube with curvature and varying cross-section
to a straight, constant cross-section, tube with variable refractive index.
Stable formulations for the scattering operators in terms of ordinary
differential equations are formulated by wave splitting using an invariant
imbedding technique. The mathematical framework is also generalised to handle
tubes with edges, which are of large technical interest. The numerical method
consists of using a standard MATLAB ordinary differential equation solver for
the truncated reflection and transmission matrices in a Fourier sine basis. It

similar to that considered by Mabuchi [Quant. Semiclass. Opt. 8, 1103 (1996)]:
a radiatively damped atom driven by an unknown Rabi frequency $\Omega$ (as

measuring the environment of the system, knowledge about the system state, and
about the uncertain dynamical parameter, can be acquired. We find that these
two sorts of knowledge acquisition (quantified by the posterior distribution
for $\Omega$, and the conditional purity of the system, respectively) are quite
distinct processes, which are not strongly correlated. Also, the quality and
quantity of knowledge gain depend strongly on the type of monitoring scheme. We
compare five different detection schemes (direct, adaptive, homodyne of the $x$

different measures of the knowledge gain (Shannon information about $\Omega$,

two directions for generalization of these equations. First, we study a general

Second, we explore the problem of formulating a relativistic stochastic

field system based on the interaction picture of Tomonaga and Schwinger. The
stochastic noise term in this equation can couple to any local scalar density
that commutes with the interaction energy density, and leads to collapse onto
spatially localized eigenstates. However, as found in a similar model by
Pearle, the equation predicts an infinite rate of energy nonconservation
proportional to $\delta^3(\vec 0)$, arising from the local double commutator in
the drift term.

points have a specificed tensor product form. Two mathematical problems in the
quantum computing literature arise from this context: (1) the determination
whether a given rho is in S and (2) a measure of the ``entanglement'' of such a
rho in terms of its distance from S. In this paper we describe these two
problems in detail for a linear algebra audience, discuss some recent results
from the quantum computing literature, and prove some new results.We emphasize
the roles of densities rho as both operators on the Hilbert space H[N] and also
as points in a real Hilbert space M. We are able to compute the nearest
separable densities tau0 to rho0 in particular classes of inseparable densities

quantum-mechanical theory of localizable particles and, thus, that relativity
and quantum mechanics can be reconciled only in the context of quantum field
theory. We point out some loopholes in the existing arguments, and we provide
two no-go theorems to close these loopholes. However, even with these loopholes
closed, it does not yet follow that relativity plus quantum mechanics
exclusively requires a field ontology, since relativistic quantum field theory
itself might permit an ontology of localizable particles supervenient on the
fundamental fields. Thus, we provide another no-go theorem to rule out this
possibility. Finally, we allay potential worries about this conclusion by
arguing that relativistic quantum field theory can nevertheless explain the
possibility of &quot;particle detections,&quot; as well as the pragmatic utility of
&quot;particle talk.&quot;

reality in which we are imbedded, and settles for practical rules describing
connections between our observations. Many physicist have regarded this
renunciation of our effort to describe nature herself as premature, and John
von Neumann reformulated quantum theory as a theory of an evolving objective
universe interacting with human consciousness. This interaction is associated
both in Copenhagen quantum theory and in von Neumann quantum theory with a
sudden change that brings the objective physical state of a system in line with
a subjectively felt psychical reality. The objective physical state is thereby
converted from a material substrate to an informational and dispositional
substrate that carries both the information incorporated into it by the
psychical realities, and certain dispositions for the occurrence of future
psychical realities. The present work examines and proposes solutions to two
problems that have appeared to block the development of this conception of
nature. The first problem is how to reconcile this theory with the principles
of relativistic quantum field theory; the second problem is to understand
whether, strictly within quantum theory, a person's mind can affect the
activities of his brain, and if so how. Solving the first problem involves
resolving a certain nonlocality question. The proposed solution to the second
problem is based on a postulated connection between effort, attention, and the
quantum Zeno effect. This solution explains on the basis of quantum physics a
large amount of heretofore unexplained data amassed by psychologists.

  Two Interacting Spins</title><description>  We consider the quantum and classical Liouville dynamics of a non-integrable
model of two coupled spins. Initially localised quantum states spread
exponentially to the system dimension when the classical dynamics are chaotic.
The long-time behaviour of the quantum probability distributions and, in
particular, the parameter-dependent rates of relaxation to the equilibrium
state are surprisingly well approximated by the classical Liouville mechanics
even for small quantum numbers. As the accessible classical phase space becomes
predominantly chaotic, the classical and quantum probability equilibrium
configurations approach the microcanonical distribution, although the quantum
equilibrium distributions exhibit characteristic `minimum' fluctuations away
from the microcanonical state. The magnitudes of the quantum-classical
differences arising from the equilibrium quantum fluctuations are studied for
both pure and mixed (dynamically entangled) quantum states. In both cases the
standard deviation of these fluctuations decreases as $(\hbar/{\mathcal
J})^{1/2}$, where ${\mathcal J}$ is a measure of the system size. In
conclusion, under a variety of conditions the differences between quantum and
classical Liouville mechanics are shown to become vanishingly small in the
classical limit (${\mathcal J}/\hbar \to \infty$) of a non-dissipative model
endowed with only a few degrees of freedom.

interest. Fluorescence occurs when electrons drop from one level to another
without changing spin. Only electron gases in a state of equilibrium are
considered. When the system may exchange electrons with a large reservoir, the
electron-gas fluorescence is easily obtained from the well-known Fermi-Dirac
distribution. But this is not so when the number of electrons in the system is
prevented from varying, as is the case for isolated systems and for systems
that are in thermal contact with electrical insulators such as diamond. Our
accurate expressions rest on the assumption that single-electron energy levels
are evenly spaced, and that energy coupling and spin coupling between electrons
are small. These assumptions are shown to be realistic for many systems.
Fluorescence from short, nearly isolated, quantum wires is predicted to drop
abruptly in the visible, a result not predicted by the Fermi-Dirac
distribution. Our exact formulas are based on restricted and unrestricted
partitions of integers. The method is considerably simpler than the ones
proposed earlier, which are based on second quantization and contour

function, entropy, etc. for a gas consisting of such molecules.
  3. Recognition of molecular structures. Find a molecular structure given its
spectrum.
  4. Recognition of electronic devices. Given an electronic device that can be
used only as a black box how to recognize its internal construction?
  We consider mainly structures generating sparse spectrums. These algorithms
require the time from about square root to logarithm of the time of classical
analogs and for the first three problems give exponential memory saving. Say,
the time required for distinguishing two devices with the same given spectrum
is about seventh root of the time of direct classical method, for the
recognition of eigenvalue - about sixth root. Thus microscopic quantum devices
can recognize molecular structures and physical properties of environment
faster than big classical computers.

  Protocol</title><description>  By exhibiting a violation of a novel form of the Bell-CHSH inequality,
Zukowski has recently established that the quantum correlations exploited in
the standard perfect teleportation protocol cannot be recovered by any local
hidden variables model. Allowing the quantum channel state in the protocol to
be given by any density operator of two spin-1/2 particles, we show that a
violation of a generalized form of Zukowski's teleportation inequality can only
occur if the channel state, considered by itself, violates a Bell-CHSH
inequality. On the other hand, although it is sufficient for a teleportation
process to have a nonclassical fidelity-defined as a fidelity exceeding
2/3-that the channel state employed violate a Bell-CHSH inequality, we show
that such a violation does not imply a violation of Zukowski's teleportation
inequality or any of its generalizations. The implication does hold, however,
if the fidelity of the teleportation exceeds $2/3(1+1/2\sqrt{2})\approx .90$,
suggesting the existence of a regime of nonclassical values of the fidelity,
less than .90, for which the standard teleportation protocol can be modelled by
local hidden variables.

(CV). We show that the set of non--distillable states (NDS) for CV is nowhere
dense in the set of all states, i.e., the states of infinite--dimensional
bipartite systems are generically distillable. This automatically implies that
the sets of separable states, entangled states with positive partial transpose,
and bound entangled states are also nowhere dense in the set of all states. All
these properties significantly distinguish quantum CV systems from the spin

the natural numbers in quantum mechanics is extended here to k-ary
representations of all natural numbers, and to integers and rational numbers.
Since the length L is indeterminate, representations of states and operators
using creation and annihilation operators for bosons and fermions are defined.
Emphasis is on definitions and properties of operators corresponding to the
basic operations whose properties are given by the axioms for each type of
number. The importance of the requirement of efficient implementability for
physical models of the axioms is emphasized. Based on this, successor
operations for each value of j corresponding to addition of k^{j-1} if j&gt;0 and
k^{j} if j&lt;0 are defined. It follows from the efficient implementability of
these successors, which is the case for all computers, that implementation of
the addition and multiplication operators, which are defined in terms of
polynomially many iterations of the successors, should be efficient. This is
not the case for definitions based on the successor for j=1 only. This is the
only successor defined in the usual axioms of arithmetic.

  Mechanics</title><description>  Bell's theorem depends crucially on counterfactual reasoning, and is
mistakenly interpreted as ruling out a local explanation for the correlations
which can be observed between the results of measurements performed on
spatially-separated quantum systems. But in fact the Everett interpretation of
quantum mechanics, in the Heisenberg picture, provides an alternative local
explanation for such correlations. Measurement-type interactions lead, not to
many worlds but, rather, to many local copies of experimental systems and the
observers who measure their properties. Transformations of the
Heisenberg-picture operators corresponding to the properties of these systems
and observers, induced by measurement interactions, &quot;label&quot; each copy and
provide the mechanism which, e.g., ensures that each copy of one of the
observers in an EPRB or GHZM experiment will only interact with the &quot;correct&quot;
copy of the other observer(s). The conceptual problem of nonlocality is thus
replaced with a conceptual problem of proliferating labels, as correlated
systems and observers undergo measurement-type interactions with
newly-encountered objects and instruments; it is suggested that this problem
may be resolved by considering quantum field theory rather than the quantum
mechanics of particles.

Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) nonlocality for continuous variable cases.
The discussion is based on the introduction of a pseudospin operator, which has
the same algebra as the Pauli operator, for each of the $N$ modes of a light

presented for the $N$ modes, each of which has a continuous degree of freedom.
Following Mermin's argument, it is demonstrated that for $N$-mode
parity-entangled GHZ states (in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space) of the
light field, the contradictions between quantum mechanics and local realism
grow exponentially with $N$, similarly to the usual $N$-spin cases.

described first, traditional method of measuring the non-zero shift of
interference fringe in the Michelson interferometer, operating on the effects
of second order with respect to v/c, and are revealed hidden causes of the
failure to measure the shift of interference fringe in the period from 1881
till 1960. It is shown that at the latitude of Obninsk within a 24-hour
observation period the horizontal projection of aether wind velocity varies
from 140 km/s to 480 km/s. The second version of this paper (arXiv:
1003.2899v2, 15.04.2010) is supplemented with a second method of finding the
velocity of the aether wind -- through measuring the largest seasonal decrease
in the ratio of the summer shift of the interference fringe to the winter one
(equaled ~12%). It gave the same interval of values of the projections of the
aether wind velocity as the first method. More than hundred years there
persists a belief that Michelson-type interferometer can not be adjusted such
as to detect effects of the first order with respect to v/c. Below I show that
it is possible, and more successfully than on the interferometer of the second
order. In contrast to the traditional approach, in the interferometer of the
first order the light after splitting on a semi-transparent plate propagates in
both arms to the reflecting mirrors in one optical medium, and returns after
reflection from the mirrors through another optical medium. The shift of the
interference fringe was found to be proportional to the difference of
dielectric permittivities of these media. The horizontal projection of the
Earth's velocity relative to luminiferous aether measured by the first order
interferometer agrees with that found by the first two methods.

using this state does not involve nonlocality even though the fidelity achieved

Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 76}, 1613 (1994), in connection with the scarring effect
of unstable periodic orbits in highly chaotic Hamiltonian system. These
functions appear highly localized not only along periodic orbits but also on
the associated manifolds. Moreover, they show in phase space the hyperbolic
structure in the vicinity of the orbit, something which translates in
configuration space into the structure induced by the corresponding self--focal
points. On the other hand, the quantum dynamics of these functions are also
studied. Our results indicate that the probability density first evolves along
the unstable manifold emanating from the periodic orbit, and localizes
temporarily afterwards on only a few, short related periodic orbits. We believe
that this type of studies can provide some keys to disentangle the complexity
associated to the quantum mechanics of these kind of systems, which permits the
construction of a simple explanation in terms of the dynamics of a few
classical structures.

  particle</title><description>  It is suggested that a moving canonical particle interacts with a vacuum
regarded as a &quot;soft&quot; cellular space. The interaction results into the emergence
of elementary excitations of space - inertons - surrounding the particle. It is
assumed that such a motion leads not only to the spatial oscillation of the
particle along a path but to the oscillation of the particle centre-of-mass as
well. This phenomenon culminating in the anisotropic pulsation of the particle
is associated with the notion of spin. The particle-space interaction is
treated as the origin of the matter waves, which are identified with the
particle inertia and inertons surrounding the moving particle are considered as
carriers of its inert properties. Inertons are also identified with real
carriers of the gravitational interaction and the range of the particle
gravitational potential is evaluated by the inerton cloud amplitude
$\Lambda=\lambda c/v$, where $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength, $c$ and
$v$ are the velocity of light and the particle respectively. The nature of the
phase transition that occurs in a quantum system when one should pass from the
description based on the Schroedinger formalism to that of resting on the Dirac
one is explained in detail.

optimization (but has the advantage of producing density matrices which are
always non-negative definite). In addition a detailed error analysis is

However, the security of the resulting protocols depends on the selection of

  chaotic many-body systems</title><description>  Highly excited many-particle states in quantum systems such as nuclei, atoms,
quantum dots, spin systems, quantum computers etc., can be considered as
``chaotic'' superpositions of mean-field basis states (Slater determinants,
products of spin or qubit states). This is due to a very high level density of
many-body states that are easily mixed by a residual interaction between
particles (quasi-particles). For such systems, we have derived simple
analytical expressions for the time dependence of energy width of wave packets,
as well as for the entropy, number of principal basis components and inverse
participation ratio, and tested them in numerical experiments. It is shown that
the energy width $\Delta (t)$ increases linearly and very quickly saturates.
The entropy of a system increases quadratically, $S(t) \sim t^2$ at small
times, and after, can grow linearly, $S(t) \sim t$, before the saturation.
Correspondingly, the number of principal components determined by the entropy,
$N_{pc} \sim exp{(S(t))}$, or by the inverse participation ratio, increases
exponentially fast before the saturation. These results are explained in terms
of a cascade model which describes the flow of excitation in the Fock space of
basis components. Finally, a striking phenomenon of damped oscillations in the
Fock space at the transition to an equilibrium is discussed.

Lambda-type optical medium under coherent population trapping. A general case
of unequal oscillator strengths of the transitions is considered. Durations of
the probe pulse and the coupling pulse $T_{1,2}$ ($T_2&gt;T_1$) are assumed to be
shorter than any of the relevant atomic relaxation times. We propose analytical
and numerical solutions of a self-consistent set of coupled Schr\&quot;{o}dinger
equations and reduced wave equations in the adiabatic limit with the account of
the first non-adiabatic correction. The adiabaticity criterion is also
discussed with the account of the pulse propagation. The dynamics of
propagation is found to be strongly dependent on the ratio of the transition
oscillator strengths. It is shown that envelopes of the pulses slightly change
throughout the medium length at the initial stage of propagation. This distance
can be large compared to the one-photon resonant absorption length. Eventually,
the probe pulse is completely reemitted into the coupling pulse during
propagation. The effect of localization of the atomic coherence has been
observed similar to the one predicted by Fleischhauer and Lukin (PRL, {\bf 84},

manifestly covariant hydrogen-like bound states. These bound states are
solutions to a relativistic Schr\&quot;odinger equation with invariant evolution
parameter, and represent mass eigenstates whose eigenvalues correspond to the
well-known energy spectrum of the non-relativistic theory. In analogy to the
nonrelativistic case, the off-diagonal perturbation leads to a lifting of the
degeneracy in the mass spectrum. In the covariant case, not only do the
spectral lines split, but they acquire an imaginary part which is lnear in the
applied electric field, thus revealing induced bound state decay in first order
perturbation theory. This imaginary part results from the coupling of the
external field to the non-compact boost generator. In order to recover the
conventional first order Stark splitting, we must include a scalar potential
term. This term may be understood as a fifth gauge potential, which compensates
for dependence of gauge transformations on the invariant evolution parameter.

of N atoms coupled to M modes inside a coherently driven high-finesse cavity.
The description includes momentum diffusion via spontaneous emission and cavity
decay. Simple analytical formulas for the steady-state temperature and the
cooling time for a single atom are derived and show surprisingly good agreement
with direct stochastic simulations of the semiclassical equations for N atoms
with properly scaled parameters. A thorough comparison with standard free-space
Doppler cooling is performed and yields a lower temperature and a cooling time
enhancement by a factor of M times the square of the ratio of the atom-field
coupling constant to the cavity decay rate. Finally it is shown that laser
cooling with negligible spontaneous emission should indeed be possible,
especially for relatively light particles in a strongly coupled field
configuration.

 Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) gedanken experiment is sufficient to demonstrate
quantum entanglement.
 A further set of measurable criteria sufficient to demonstrate EPR gedanken
experiment is proposed, these being the set of criteria sufficient to
demonstrate entanglement, by way of a measured violation of a necessary
condition of separability. In this way, provided the spatial separation of
systems is sufficient to ensure EPR's locality hypothesis, it is shown how a
measured demonstration of entanglement will, at least, be equivalent to a
demonstration of the EPR gedanken experiment. Using hidden variables it is
explained how such demonstrations are a direct manifestation of the
inconsistency of local realism with quantum mechanics.

several features normally thought to be unique to quantum mechanics. Spin-like
self-orbiting helical motions are shown to exist at discrete values for the
velocity of the tachyon in Feynman-Wheeler electrodynamics and in normal causal
electrodynamics more complex closed orbits also appear to exist. Tunneling
behavior of the classical tachyon is observed at classical turning points
depending on the angle of incidence. The equations of motion appear to be
chaotic and effectively indeterministic when the tachyon crosses its own past
light cone. It is argued that self-interacting tachyons moving in a tight helix
would behave causally, and that they could be a basis for a hidden variable
description of quantum mechanics. A procedure is proposed which could determine
the fine structure constant.

  Electromagnetic Backgrounds</title><description>  A reformulation of fermionic QFT in electromagnetic backgrounds is presented
which uses methods analogous to those of conventional multiparticle quantum
mechanics. Emphasis is placed on the (Schr\&quot;odinger picture) states of the
system, described in terms of Slater determinants of Dirac states, and not on
the field operator $\hat{\psi}(x)$ (which is superfluous in this approach). The
vacuum state `at time $\tau$' is defined as the Slater determinant of a basis
for the span of the negative spectrum of the `first quantized' Hamiltonian
$\hat{H}(\tau)$, thus providing a concrete realisation of the Dirac Sea. The
general S-matrix element of the theory is derived in terms of time-dependent
Bogoliubov coefficients, demonstrating that the S-matrix follows directly from
the definition of inner product between Slater determinants. The process of
`Hermitian extension', inherited directly from conventional multiparticle
quantum mechanics, allows second quantized operators to be defined without
appealing to a complete set of orthonormal modes, and provides an extremely
straightforward derivation of the general expectation value of the theory. The
concept of `radar time', advocated by Bondi in his work on k-calculus, is used
to generalise the particle interpretation to an arbitrarily moving observer. A
definition of particle results, which depends {\it only} on the observer's
motion and the background present, not on any choice of coordinates or gauge,
or of the particle detector. We relate this approach to conventional methods by
comparing and contrasting various derivations. Our particle definition can be
viewed as a generalisation to arbitrary observers of Gibbons' approach.

An
unstable atom has amplitude in its original state after many lifetimes
($\tau_L$). But in the laboratory, transitions seem to go instantaneously, as
suggested by the term &quot;quantum jump.&quot;
  The problem studied here is whether the &quot;jump&quot; can be assigned a duration, in
theory and in experiment. Two characteristic times are defined, jump time
($\tau_J$) and passage time ($\tau_P$). Both use Zeno time, $\tau_Z$, defined
in terms of $H$ and its initial state as $\tau_Z \equiv \hbar/\sqrt{&lt;\psi|
(H-E_\psi)^2 |\psi&gt;}$, with $E_\psi \equiv &lt;\psi|H|\psi&gt;$.
  $\tau_J$ is defined in terms of the time needed to slow (\`a la the quantum
Zeno effect) the decay: $\tau_J \equiv \tau_Z^2/\tau_L$. It appears in several
contexts. It is related to tunneling time in barrier penetration. Its inverse
is the bandwidth of the Hamiltonian, in a time-energy uncertainty principle.
$\tau_J$ is also an indicator of the duration of the quadratic decay regime in
both experiment and in numerical calculations (cf. Fig.~2 of PRA 57,1509
(1998).)
  The passage time, $\tau_P$, arises from unitary evolution sans
interpretation. It is based on a bound of Fleming (Nuov. Cim. 16 A, 232
(1973)): for any $H$ and $\psi$ a system cannot evolve to a state orthogonal to
$\psi$ for $t&lt; \tau_P \equiv \pi \tau_Z/2$. By including apparatus in $H$,
$\tau_P$ limits the observation of decay according to the quantum measurement
ideas proposed in &quot;Time's Arrows and Quantum Measurement,&quot; Cambridge U. Press,
1997, thereby allowing an experimental test of these ideas.

states. At the bottom of this hierarchy are the partial density of states for
which represent the contribution to the local density of states if both the
incident and outgoing scattering channel are prescribed. On the next higher
level is the injectivity which represents the contribution to the local density
of states if only the incident channel is prescribed regardless of the final
scattering channel. The injectivity is related by reciprocity to the emissivity
of a point into a quantum channel. The sum of all partial density of states or
the sum of all injectivities or the sum of all emissivities is equal to the
local density of states. The use of the partial density of states is
illustrated for a number of different electron transport problems in mesoscopic
physics: The transmission from a tunneling tip into a mesoscopic conductor, the
discussion of inelastic or phase breaking scattering with a voltage probe, and
the ac-conductance of mesoscopic conductors. The transition from a capacitive
response (positive time-delay) to an inductive response (negative time-delay)
for a quantum point contact is used to illustrate the difficulty in associating
time-scales with a linear response analysis. A brief discussion of the
off-diagonal elements of a partial density of states matrix is presented. The
off-diagonal elements permit to investigate carrier fluctuations away from the
average carrier density. The work concludes with a discussion of the relation

necessary and sufficient condition for the positivity of Gaussian operators.
Based on this, a number of creterions on the inseparability and distillability
for the multimode Gaussian states are naturally drawn. We finally give an
explicit formula for the state in a subspace of a global Gaussian state. This
formula, together with the known results for Gaussian states, gives the
criterions for the inseparability and distillability in a subspace of the
global Gaussian state.

the ions is monitored by a spatially resolving photo multiplier. Depending on
detuning and intensity of the cooling lasers, macroscopically different
motional states corresponding to different ion temperatures are observed. We
also derive the ions' temperature from detailed analytical calculations of
laser cooling taking into account the Zeeman structure of the energy levels
involved. The observed motional states perfectly match the calculated
temperatures. Significant heating is observed in the vicinity of the dark
resonances of the Zeeman-split S_1/2-D_3/2 Raman transitions. Here two-photon
processes dominate the interaction between lasers and ions. Parameter regimes
of laser light are identified that imply most efficient laser cooling.

based on the close relationship of controllers to communication channels. A
communication channel takes an input state and transforms it into an output
state. A controller, similarly, takes the initial state of a system to be
controlled and transforms it into a target state. In this sense, a controller
can be thought of as an actuation channel that acts on inputs to produce
desired outputs. In this transformation process, two different control
strategies can be adopted: (i) the controller applies an actuation dynamics
that is independent of the state of the system to be controlled (open-loop
control); or (ii) the controller enacts an actuation dynamics that is based on
some information about the state of the controlled system (closed-loop
control). Using this communication channel model of control, we provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be perfectly controllable
and perfectly observable in terms of information and entropy. In addition, we
derive a quantitative trade-off between the amount of information gathered by a
closed-loop controller and its relative performance advantage over an open-loop
controller in stabilizing a system. This work supplements earlier results [H.
Touchette, S. Lloyd, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1156 (2000)] by providing new
derivations of the advantage afforded by closed-loop control and by proposing
an information-based optimality criterion for control systems. New applications
of this approach pertaining to proportional controllers, and the control of
chaotic maps are also presented.

Entanglement?, quant-ph/0102119) tried to indicate that the reason behind a
state rho having higher amount of entanglement (as quantified by the
entanglement of formation) than a state eta, but producing the same amount of
Bell-violation, is due to the fact that the amount of mixedness (as quantified
by the linearised entropy) in rho is higher than that in eta. We counter their
argument with examples. We extend these considerations to the von Neumann

Bell-violation requires different amounts of entanglement cannot, at least, be
explained by mixedness alone.

The trade-off is quantified using two mean fidelities: the operation fidelity
which characterizes the average resemblance of the final qubit state to the
initial one, and the estimation fidelity describing the quality of the obtained
estimate. We analyze properties of quantum operations saturating the
achievability bound for the operation fidelity versus the estimation fidelity,
which allows us to reduce substantially the complexity of the problem of
finding the trade-off curve. The reduced optimization problem has the form of
an eigenvalue problem for a set of tridiagonal matrices, and it can be easily

phi-meson. It is shown, in agreement with Bell's theorem, that the most general
local hidden-variable model fails in reproducing the whole set of
quantum-mechanical observables. We achieve this conclusion by employing two
different approaches. In the first approach, the local realistic observables
are deduced from the most general premises concerning locality and realism, and
Bell-like inequalities are not employed. The other approach makes use of Bell's
inequalities. Under particular conditions for the detection times, within the
first approach the discrepancy between quantum mechanics and local realism for
the asymmetry parameter turns out to be not less than 20%. A similar
incompatibility can be made evident by means of a Bell-type test, by employing
a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt's inequality written in terms of properly
normalized observables. Because of its relatively low experimental accuracy,
the data obtained by the CPLEAR collaboration do not yet allow a decisive test
of local realism. Such a test, both with and without the use of Bell's
inequalities, should be feasible in the future at the Frascati Phi-factory.

those solitons, while a complete study, with a larger magnetic effect, would

  The flux of energy in the regular filaments is nearly a ''critical flux'',
depending slightly on the external fields, so that the energy of the (3+0)D
soliton is quantified, but may be slightly changed by external interactions.
  The creation of electron positron pairs in the vacuum by purely
electromagnetic fields shows a nonlinearity of vacuum at high energies;
supposing this nonlinearity convenient, elementary particles may be (3+0)D
solitons.
  Set that the nearly linear part of the soliton is the $\Psi$ wave while the
remainder, (the torus) is the $u$ wave; if the torus is not absorbed by Young

We show that systems with as few as 10-16 fermions can exhibit clear features

knowledge about the probability distribution outside a local region is limited.
The information needed to compute expectation values of local observables can
be collected in a quantum mechanical state vector, whereas further statistical
information about the probability distribution outside the local region becomes
irrelevant. The translation of the available information between neighboring
local regions is expressed by a Hamilton operator. A quantum mechanical
operator can be associated to each local observable, such that expectation
values of ``classical'' observables can be computed by the usual quantum
mechanical rules. The requirement that correlation functions should respect
equivalence relations for local obeservables induces a non-commutative product
in classical statistics, in complete correspondence to the quantum mechanical
operator product. We also discuss the issue of interference and the complex
structure of quantum mechanics within our classical statistical setting.

quantum boolean logic is to use auxiliary qubits as intermediate storage. This
inefficient implementation causes a large number of auxiliary qubits to be
used. In this paper, we have derived a systematic way of realizing any general
m-to-n bit combinational boolean logic using elementary quantum gates. Our
approach transforms the m-to-n bit classical mapping into a t-bit unitary
quantum operation with minimum number of auxiliary qubits, then a variation of
Toffoli gate is used as the basic building block to construct the unitary
operation. Finally, each of these building blocks can be decomposed into
one-bit rotation and two-bit control-U gates. The efficiency of the network is
taken into consideration by formulating it as a constrained set partitioning

system described by the Dirac equation. Its classical analog S_dc is described
by a system of ordinary differential equations, containing the quantum constant
h as a parameter. Dynamic equations for S_dc are determined by the Dirac
equation uniquely. Both dynamic systems S_D and S_dc appear to be
nonrelativistic. One succeeded in transforming nonrelativistic dynamic system
S_dc into relativistic one S_dcr. The dynamic system S_dcr appears to be a
two-particle structure (special case of a relativistic rotator). It explains
freely such properties of S_D as spin and magnetic moment, which are strange
for pointlike structure. The rigidity function f_r(a), describing rotational
part of total mass as a function of the radius $a$ of rotator, has been
calculated for S_dcr. For investigation of S_D and construction of S_dc one
uses new dynamic methods: dynamic quantization and dynamic disquantization.
These relativistic pure dynamic procedures do not use principles of quantum
mechanics (QM). They generalize and replace conventional quantization and
transition to classical approximation. Totality of these methods forms the
model conception of quantum phenomena (MCQP). Technique of MCQP is more subtle
and effective, than conventional methods of QM. MCQP relates to conventional
QM, much as the statistical physics relates to thermodynamics.

Different models of numbers are described to show the independence of both EI

there is no integer $k$ such that it suffices to consider catalysts of

Hardy\cite{hardy}, we show that there is in fact an exact numerical coincidence
between a) a pair of classically contradictory assertions about the locations

location. The internal consistency of these results is due to the novel way by
which quantum mechanics &quot;resolves&quot; the paradox: first, by allowing for two
distinguishable manifestations of how the electron and positron can be at the
same location: either as single particles or as a pair; and secondly, by
allowing these properties to take either sign. In particular, we discuss the

qubits, i.e. two-state quantum systems including recent realization of three-

calls for entanglement in quantum system of higher dimensions. Here we report
the first realization of multi-dimensional entanglement exploiting the orbital
angular momentum of photons, which are states of the electromagnetic field with
phase singularities (doughnut modes). The properties of such states could be of
importance for the efforts in the field of quantum computation and quantum

easily mapped to one another. We use this observation to obtain a class of
exactly solvable time-dependent Schr\&quot;odinger equations. As applications of our

  Locally</title><description>  We consider one copy of a quantum system prepared with equal prior
probability in one of two non-orthogonal entangled states of multipartite
distributed among separated parties. We demonstrate that these two states can
be optimally distinguished in the sense of conclusive discrimination by local
operations and classical communications(LOCC) alone. And this proves strictly
the conjecture that Virmani et.al. [8] confirmed numerically and analytically.
Generally, the optimal protocol requires local POVM operations which are

U(1) symmetry in the limit of V \to \infty, when V is large but finite. We
estimate the energy difference between the `symmetric ground state' (SGS),
which is the lowest-energy state that does not breaks the symmetry, and a `pure
phase vacuum' (PPV), which approaches a symmetry-breaking vacuum as V \to
\infty. Under some natural postulates on the energy of the SGS, it is shown
that PPVs always have a higher energy than the SGS, and we derive a lower bound
of the excess energy. We argue that the lower bound is O(V^0), which becomes
much larger than the excitation energies of low-lying excited states for a
large V. We also discuss the collapse time of PPVs for interacting many bosons.
It is shown that the wave function collapses in a microscopic time scale,
because PPVs are not energy eigenstates. We show, however, that for PPVs the
expectation value of any observable, which is a finite polynomial of boson
operators and their derivatives, does not collapse for a macroscopic time
scale. In this sense, the collapse time of PPVs is macroscopically long.

delocalization transition and show that for the interaction between nearest
qubits, the transition is very different from that to quantum chaos. We explain
this phenomena by showing that in the considered region of parameters our model
is close to an integrable one. According to a general opinion, the threshold
for the onset of quantum chaos due to the interqubit interaction decreases with
an increase of the number of qubits. Contrary to this expectation, for a
magnetic field with constant gradient we have found that chaos border does not
depend on the number of qubits. We give analytical estimates which explain this

quantum cell probe model subsumes the classical cell probe model, and many
quantum query algorithms like Grover's algorithm fall into this framework. Our
lower bound improves the previous known lower bound for the predecessor problem
in the classical cell probe model with randomised query schemes, and matches
the classical deterministic upper bound of Beame and Fich. Beame and Fich have
also proved a matching lower bound for the predecessor problem, but only in the
classical deterministic setting. Our lower bound has the advantage that it
holds for the more general quantum model, and also, its proof is substantially
simpler than that of Beame and Fich. We prove our lower bound by obtaining a
round elimination lemma for quantum communication complexity. A similar lemma
was proved by Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson for classical communication
complexity, but it was not strong enough to prove a lower bound matching the
upper bound of Beame and Fich. Our quantum round elimination lemma also allows
us to prove rounds versus communication tradeoffs for some quantum
communication complexity problems like the &quot;greater-than&quot; problem. We also
study the &quot;static membership&quot; problem in the quantum cell probe model.
Generalising a result of Yao, we show that if the storage scheme is implicit,
that is it can only store members of the subset and `pointers', then any
quantum query scheme must make $\Omega(\log n)$ probes.

Controlled-U gates that act on qubits, and assume that we know the eigenvalues.
It is then shown how to use singlet states to produce qubits in the eigenstates
of the gate. We then remove the assumption that we know the eigenvalues and
show how to both find the eigenvalues and produce qubits in the eigenstates.
Finally, we look at the case where the unitary operator acts on qutrits and has

  Automata</title><description>  Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) may offer a viable alternative of
traditional transistor-based technology at the nanoscale. When modeling a QCA
circuit, the number of degrees of freedom necessary to describe the quantum
mechanical state increases exponentially making modeling even modest size cell
arrays difficult. The intercellular Hartree approximation largely reduces the
number of state variables and still gives good results especially when the
system remains near ground state. This suggests that large part of the
correlation degrees of freedom are not essential from the point of view of the
dynamics. In certain cases, however, such as for example the majority gate with
unequal input legs, the Hartree approximation gives qualitatively wrong
results. An intermediate model is constructed between the Hartree approximation
and the exact model, based on the coherence vector formalism. By including
correlation effects to a desired degree, it improves the results of the Hartree
method and gives the approximate dynamics of the correlation terms. It also
models the majority gate correctly. Beside QCA cell arrays, our findings are
valid for Ising spin chains in transverse magnetic field, and can be
straightforwardly generalized for coupled two-level systems with a more
complicated Hamiltonian.

  EPR and Measurement Problems</title><description>  It is shown that the quantum theory can be formulated on homogeneous spaces
of generalized coherent states in a manner that accounts for interference,
entanglement, and the linearity of dynamics without using the superposition
principle. The coherent state labels, which are essentially instructions for
preparing states, make it unnecessary to identify properties with projectors in
Hilbert space. This eliminates the so called &quot;eigenvalue-eigenstate&quot; link, and
the theory thereby escapes the measurement problem. What the theory allows us
to predict is the distribution in the outcomes of tests of relations between
coherent states. It is shown that quantum non-determinism can be attributed to
a hidden variable (noise) in the space of relations without violating the no-go
theorems (e.g. Kochen-Specker). It is shown that the coherent state vacuum is
distorted when entangled states are generated. The non-locality of the vacuum
permits this distortion to be felt everywhere without the transmission of a
signal and thereby accounts for EPR correlations in a manifestly covariant way.

applying the numerical quasiadiabatic propagator path integral method, we
obtain the numerically precise time-resolved evolution of this interacting
two-qubit system in presence of time-dependent external fields without further
approximations. We simulate the dissipative gate operation for characteristic
experimental realizations of condensed matter qubits; namely, the flux and
charge qubits realized in superconducting Josephson systems and qubits formed
with semiconductor quantum dots. Moreover, we study systematically the quality
of the XOR gate by determining the four characteristic gate quantifiers:
fidelity, purity, the quantum degree, and the entanglement capability of the
gate. Two different types of errors in the qubits have been modelled, i.e.,
bit-flip errors and phase errors. The dependence of the quality of the gate
operation on the environmental temperature, on the friction strength stemming
from the system-bath interaction, and on the strength of the interqubit
coupling is systematically explored: Our main finding is that the four gate
quantifiers depend only weakly on temperature, but are rather sensitive to the
friction strength.

steps, faster than the O(n log n) steps required by the classical walk. In the
continuous-time case, the probability distribution is {\em exactly} uniform at
this time. More importantly, these walks expose several subtleties in the
definition of mixing time for quantum walks. Even though the continuous-time
walk has an O(n) instantaneous mixing time at which it is precisely uniform, it
never approaches the uniform distribution when the stopping time is chosen
randomly as in [AharonovAKV2001]. Our analysis treats interference between
terms of different phase more carefully than is necessary for the walk on the
cycle; previous general bounds predict an exponential, rather than linear,
mixing time for the hypercube.

  problem</title><description>  We investigate a reformulation of the dynamics of interacting fermion systems
in terms of a stochastic extension of Time Dependent Hartree-Fock equations.
The noise is found from a path-integral representation of the evolution
operator and allows to interpret the exact N-body state as a coherent average
over Slater determinants evolving under the random mean-fied. The full density
operator and the expectation value of any observable are then reconstructed
using pairs of stochastic uncorrelated wave functions. The imaginary time
propagation is also presented and gives a similar stochastic one-body scheme
which converges to the exact ground state without developing a sign problem. In
addition, the growth of statistical errors is examined to show that the
stochastic formulation never explode in a finite dimensional one-body space.
Finally, we consider initially correlated systems and present some numerical
implementations in exactly soluble models to analyse the precision and the
stability of the approach in practical cases.

  computer</title><description>  The quest to build a quantum computer has been inspired by the recognition of
the formidable computational power such a device could offer. In particular
silicon-based proposals, using the nuclear or electron spin of dopants as
qubits, are attractive due to the long spin relaxation times involved, their
scalability, and the ease of integration with existing silicon technology.
Fabrication of such devices however requires atomic scale manipulation - an
immense technological challenge. We demonstrate that it is possible to
fabricate an atomically-precise linear array of single phosphorus bearing
molecules on a silicon surface with the required dimensions for the fabrication
of a silicon-based quantum computer. We also discuss strategies for the
encapsulation of these phosphorus atoms by subsequent silicon crystal growth.

of his physical ideas can be supported by the mathematical instruments
available from the Lorentz group. As a consequence, it is possible to construct
a Lorentz-covariant picture of the parton model. It is shown first how the
Lorentz group can be used for studying the internal space-time symmetries of
relativistic particles. These symmetries are dictated by Wigner's little
groups, whose transformations leave the energy-momentum four-vector of a given
particle invariant. The symmetry of massive particles is like the
three-dimensional rotation group, while the symmetry of massless particles is
locally isomorphic to the two-dimensional Euclidean group. It is noted that the
E(2)-like symmetry of massless particles can be obtained as an
infinite-momentum and/or zero-mass limit of the O(3)-like little group for
massive particles. It is shown that the formalism can be extended to cover
relativistic particles with space-time extensions, such as heavy ions and
hadrons in the quark model. It is possible to construct representations of the
little group using harmonic oscillators, which Feynman et al. used for studying
relativistic extended hadrons. This oscillator formalism allows us to show that
Feynman's parton model is a Lorentz-boosted quark model. The formalism also

in Maxwell's equations viewed as the wave equation for photons. In a medium
containing ``inverted energy populations'' of excited atoms, e.g. in a LASER
medium, one may again compute possible ``negative probabilities''. The
resolution of the electromagnetic Klein paradox is that when the atoms decay,
the final state may contain more photons then were contained the initial state.
The optical theorem total cross section for scattering photons from excited

counterparts of LDOS and the structure of eigenstates (SES), the effects of the
boundary are first incorporated (via a canonical transformation) into an
effective potential, rendering the one-particle motion in the 2D rippled
billiard equivalent to that of two-interacting particles in 1D geometry. We
show that classical counterparts of SES and LDOS in the case of strong chaotic
motion reveal quite a good correspondence with the quantum quantities. We also
show that the main features of the SES and LDOS can be explained in terms of
the underlying classical dynamics, in particular of certain periodic orbits. On
the other hand, statistical properties of eigenstates and LDOS turn out to be
different from those prescribed by random matrix theory. We discuss the quantum

individual LDOS that seem to be generic for this type of billiards with a large

 J.S. Bell has argued that local hidden parameter theories that reproduce the

to certain types of errors because of the geometric property of the Berry
phase. Here we give a scheme to realize the NMR C-NOT gate through
Aharonov-Anandan's phase(non-adiabatic cyclic phase) shift on the dynamic phase
free evolution loop.
  In our scheme, the gate is run non-adiabatically, thus it is less affected by
the decoherence. And, in the scheme we have chosen the the zero dynamic phase

the cycle of the pump. In this regime the pump is characterized by the matrix
of energy shift which we introduce as the dual to Wigner's time delay. The
energy shift determines the charge transport, the dissipation, the noise and
the entropy production. We prove a general lower bound on dissipation in a
quantum channel and define optimal pumps as those that saturate the bound. We
give a geometric characterization of optimal pumps and show that they are
noiseless and transport integral charge in a cycle. Finally we discuss an
example of an optimal pump related to the Hall effect.

necessary to allow the length of the encoded messages to vary. We develop a
general framework for variable-length quantum messages in close analogy to the
classical case and show that lossless compression is only possible if the
message to be compressed is known to the sender. The lossless compression of an
ensemble of messages is bounded from below by its von-Neumann entropy. We show
that it is possible to reduce the number of qbits passing through a quantum
channel even below the von-Neumann entropy by adding a classical side-channel.
We give an explicit communication protocol that realizes lossless and
instantaneous quantum data compression and apply it to a simple example. This
protocol can be used for both online quantum communication and storage of
quantum data.

an environment of arbitrary coherence length is predicted within a relevant
model of decoherence. The results are reported for quantum bits (qubits)
coupling individually to different environments (`independent decoherence') and
qubits interacting collectively with the same reservoir (`collective
decoherence'). In both cases, explicit decoherence functions are derived for
any number of qubits. The decay of the coherences of the register is shown to
strongly depend on the input states: we show that this sensitivity is a
characteristic of $both$ types of coupling (collective and independent) and not
only of the collective coupling, as has been reported previously. A non-trivial
behaviour (&quot;recoherence&quot;) is found in the decay of the off-diagonal elements of
the reduced density matrix in the specific situation of independent
decoherence. Our results lead to the identification of decoherence-free states
in the collective decoherence limit. These states belong to subspaces of the
system's Hilbert space that do not get entangled with the environment, making
them ideal elements for the engineering of ``noiseless'' quantum codes. We also
discuss the relations between decoherence of the quantum register and
computational complexity based on the new dynamical results obtained for the
register density matrix.

fundamental principles of quantum physics. It allows a sender (Alice) to sign a
message in such a way that the signature can be validated by a number of
different people, and all will agree either that the message came from Alice or
that it has been tampered with. To accomplish this task, each recipient of the
message must have a copy of Alice's &quot;public key,&quot; which is a set of quantum
states whose exact identity is known only to Alice. Quantum public keys are
more difficult to deal with than classical public keys: for instance, only a
limited number of copies can be in circulation, or the scheme becomes insecure.
However, in exchange for this price, we achieve unconditionally secure digital
signatures. Sending an m-bit message uses up O(m) quantum bits for each
recipient of the public key. We briefly discuss how to securely distribute
quantum public keys, and show the signature scheme is absolutely secure using
one method of key distribution. The protocol provides a model for importing the
ideas of classical public key cryptography into the quantum world.

external magnetic field. The universal algebraic structure underlying the
holomorphic $n$-supersymmetry is found. It is shown that the essential

holomorphic $n$-supersymmetry to the 1D quasi-exactly solvable (QES) problems
is demonstrated by means of the reduction of the systems with hyperbolic or

the original 2D holomorphic supersymmetry, the reduced 1D supersymmetry

single--mode field operators $a$ and $a^{\dagger}$ that generalizes the linear
Bogoliubov transformation familiar in the construction of the harmonic
oscillator squeezed states. This generalization is obtained by adding to the
linear transformation a nonlinear function of any of the fundamental quadrature
operators $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$, making the original Bogoliubov transformation
quadrature--dependent. Remarkably, the conditions of canonicity do not impose
any constraint on the form of the nonlinear function, and lead to a set of
nontrivial algebraic relations between the $c$--number coefficients of the
transformation. We examine in detail the structure and the properties of the
new quantum states defined as eigenvectors of the transformed annihilation
operator $b$. These eigenvectors define a class of multiphoton squeezed states.
The structure of the uncertainty products and of the quasiprobability
distributions in phase space shows that besides coherence properties, these
states exhibit a squeezing and a deformation (cooling) of the phase--space
trajectories, both of which strongly depend on the form of the nonlinear
function. The presence of the extra nonlinear term in the phase of the wave
functions has also relevant consequences on photon statistics and correlation
properties. The non quadratic structure of the associated Hamiltonians suggests
that these states be generated in connection with multiphoton processes in

paper presents a Monte Carlo simulation that keeps track of each level
occupancy (0 or 1) in the conduction and valence bands, and of the number of
light quanta in the optical cavity. When there is good electron-lattice thermal
contact the electron and hole temperatures remain equal to that of the lattice.
In that case, elementary laser-diode noise theory results are accurately
reproduced by the simulation. But when the thermal contact is poor (or, almost
equivalently, at high power levels) new effects occur (spectral-hole burning,
temperature fluctuations, statistical fluctuations of the optical gain) that
are difficult to handle theoretically. Our numerical simulation shows that the
frequency domain over which the photo-current spectral density is below the
shot-noise level becomes narrower as the optical power increases.

criterion characterizes the initial symmetry breaking and the destruction of
the corresponding integrals of motion in a perturbed system, which causes the

occurs at a certain critical value of the perturbation parameter. In our

the critical perturbation parameter for the transition from regularity to chaos

environmentally induced disturbance at a sufficiently small value, and
examining the dynamics as the system is made more macroscopic. When the system
action is relatively small, the dynamics is quantum mechanical and when the
system action is sufficiently large there is a transition to classical
behavior. The dynamics of the rotor in the region of transition, characterized
by the late-time momentum diffusion coefficient, can be strikingly different
from both the purely quantum and classical results. Remarkably, the early time
diffusive behavior of the quantum system, even when different from its

This shows that such measurements can succeed in extracting essentially quantum

individual spin-1/2 entities. If the spin-S entity is in a maximal spin state,
the 2S individual spin-1/2 entities behave as a collection of indistinguishable
but separated entities. If not so, we have to introduce the same kind of hidden
correlations as required for a hidden correlation representation of a compound
quantum systems described by a symmetrical superposition. Moreover, by applying
the Majorana representation and Aerts' representation for a spin-1/2 entity,
this hidden correlation representation yields a classical mechanistic
representation of a spin-S entity in R^3.

(p.v.) amplitudes of
weak radiative hyperon decays in the VMD approach, and the violation of Hara's
theorem in particular, are also obtained when direct coupling e_q
\bar{q}\gamma_{\mu}q A^{\mu} of photon to quarks is used in place of VMD. Thus,
violation of Hara's theorem in VMD-based models does not result from the lack
of gauge invariance. It is further shown that, in the static limit of the quark
model, the CA commutator term in the p.v. amplitudes of nonleptonic hyperon
decays (NLHD) and the parity-violating \Sigma ^+ \to p \gamma decay amplitude
are proportional to each other. As a result, Hara's theorem may be satisfied in
this limit if and only if the contribution from the CA commutator in NLHD is
zero. Violation of Hara's theorem is traced back to the nonlocality of quark
model states in the static limit. It is argued that the ensuing intrinsic
baryon nonlocality does not have to be unphysical. It is stressed that the \Xi
^0 \to \Lambda \gamma asymmetry will provide very important information
concerning the presence or absence of nonlocal features in p.v. photon coupling
to baryons at vanishing photon momentum. If the \Xi ^0 \to \Lambda \gamma
asymmetry is found negative, Hara's theorem is satisfied but the
gauge-invariant quark model machinery predicting its violation must miss some
contribution, or be modified. If experiment confirms positive \Xi ^0 \to
\Lambda \gamma asymmetry, then, most likely, Hara's theorem is violated.
Although positive \Xi ^0 \to \Lambda \gamma asymmetry admits of the possibility
that Hara's theorem is satisfied, this alternative is in disagreement with
hints suggested by the similarity of photon and vector-meson couplings and the
observed size of p.v. nuclear forces.

communication fidelity decreases exponentially with the channel length. We
describe a scheme that allows to implement robust quantum communication over

entity, how it is, how it reacts to experiments, how we can make statistics
with it, and how it changes under the influence of the rest of the universe.
Therefore we base our formalism on the following basic notions: (1) the states
of the entity; they describe the modes of being of the entity, (2) the
experiments that can be performed on the entity; they describe how we act upon
and collect knowledge about the entity, (3) the probabilities; they describe
our repeated experiments and the statistics of these repeated experiments, (4)
the symmetries; they describe the interactions of the entity with the external
world without being experimented upon. Starting from these basic notions we
formulate the necessary derived notions: mixed states, mixed experiments and
events, an eigen closure structure describing the properties of the entity, an
ortho closure structure introducing an orthocomplementation, outcome
determination, experiment determination, state determination and atomicity
giving rise to some of the topological separation axioms for the closures. We
define the notion of sub entity in a general way and identify the morphisms of
our structure. We study specific examples in detail in the light of this
formalism: a classical deterministic entity and a quantum entity described by
the standard quantum mechanical formalism. We present a possible solution to
the problem of the description of sub entities within the standard quantum
mechanical procedure using the tensor product of the Hilbert spaces, by
introducing a new completed quantum mechanics in Hilbert space, were new 'pure'

measure, the bounds can substantially overestimate the entanglement and thus do
not show the drastic decrease of entanglement with increasing mean photon
number, as does the distance measure. In particular, it shows that losses give
rise to entanglement saturation, which principally limits the amount of

operatorial formulation. This was pioneered by Koopman and von Neumann (KvN) in
the 30's. They basically formalized, via the introduction of a classical
Hilbert space, earlier work of Liouville who had shown that the classical time
evolution can take place via an operator, nowadays known as the Liouville
operator. In this paper we study how to perform the coupling of a point
particle to a gauge field in the KvN version of CM. So we basically implement
at the classical operatorial level the analog of the minimal coupling of QM. We
show that, differently than in QM, not only the momenta but also other
variables have to be coupled to the gauge field. We also analyze in details how
the gauge invariance manifests itself in the Hilbert space of KvN and indicate
the differences with QM. As an application of the KvN method we study the
Landau problem proving that there are many more degeneracies at the classical
operatorial level than at the quantum one. As a second example we go through
the Aharonov-Bohm phenomenon showing that, at the quantum level, this
phenomenon manifests its effects on the spectrum of the quantum Hamiltonian
while at the classical level there is no effect whatsoever on the spectrum of
the Liouville operator.

a connection between key distribution and entanglement purification protocols
with one-way communications. Here we provide proofs of security of standard
quantum key distribution schemes, BB84 and the six-state scheme, against the
most general attack, by using the techniques of *two*-way entanglement
purification. We demonstrate clearly the advantage of classical post-processing
with two-way classical communications over classical post-processing with only
one-way classical communications in QKD. This is done by the explicit
construction of a new protocol for (the error correction/detection and privacy
amplification of) BB84 that can tolerate a bit error rate of up to 18.9%, which
is higher than what any BB84 scheme with only one-way classical communications
can possibly tolerate. Moreover, we demonstrate the advantage of the six-state
scheme over BB84 by showing that the six-state scheme can strictly tolerate a
higher bit error rate than BB84. In particular, our six-state protocol can
tolerate a bit error rate of 26.4%, which is higher than the upper bound of 25%
bit error rate for any secure BB84 protocol. Consequently, our protocols may
allow higher key generation rate and remain secure over longer distances than
previous protocols. Our investigation suggests that two-way entanglement
purification is a useful tool in the study of advantage distillation, error
correction, and privacy amplification protocols.

  quantum paradoxes remain</title><description>  In the hidden measurement formalism that we develop in Brussels we explain
the quantum structure as due to the presence of two effects, (a) a real change
of state of the system under influence of the measurement and, (b) a lack of
knowledge about a deeper deterministic reality of the measurement process. We
show that the presence of these two effects leads to the major part of the
quantum mechanical structure of a theory where the measurements contain the two
mentioned effects. We present a quantum machine, where we can illustrate in a
simple way how the quantum structure arises as a consequence of the two
effects. We introduce a parameter 'epsilon' that measures the amount of the
lack of knowledge on the measurement process, and by varying this parameter, we
describe a continuous evolution from a quantum structure (maximal lack of
knowledge) to a classical structure (zero lack of knowledge). We show that for
intermediate values of epsilon we find a new type of structure that is neither
quantum nor classical. We analyze the quantum paradoxes and show that they can
be divided into two groups: (1) The group (measurement problem and Schrodingers
cat paradox) where the paradoxical aspects arise mainly from the application of
standard quantum theory as a general theory (e.g. also describing the
measurement apparatus). This type of paradox disappears in the hidden
measurement formalism. (2) A second group collecting the paradoxes connected to
the effect of non-locality (the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and the
violation of Bell inequalities). We show that these paradoxes are internally
resolved because the effect of non-locality turns out to be a fundamental
property of the hidden measurement formalism itself.

Environment
monitors certain observables of the system, destroying interference between the
pointer states corresponding to their eigenvalues. This leads to
environment-induced superselection or einselection, a quantum process
associated with selective loss of information. Einselected pointer states are
stable. They can retain correlations with the rest of the Universe in spite of
the environment. Einselection enforces classicality by imposing an effective
ban on the vast majority of the Hilbert space, eliminating especially the
flagrantly non-local &quot;Schr\&quot;odinger cat&quot; states. Classical structure of phase
space emerges from the quantum Hilbert space in the appropriate macroscopic
limit: Combination of einselection with dynamics leads to the idealizations of
a point and of a classical trajectory. In measurements, einselection replaces
quantum entanglement between the apparatus and the measured system with the
classical correlation.

interpretation of the atomic wave function. It follows from the results that
the atomic motion is non-classical because it does not obey the laws of

us to treat the limits imposed by nonlinearities to quantum squeezing and noise

We find that the optimal noise reduction occurs at different driving fields,

this paper we investigate the quantum Zeno effect using the definite model of

device and on the properties of the system. However, the evolution cannot be

number of applications, the nonadiabatic transition of a Bose-Einstein
condensate between Bloch bands. Numerical analysis revealed a striking
phenomenon that tunneling occurs even in the adiabatic limit as the nonlinear
parameter $C$ is above a critical value equal to the gap $V$ of avoided
crossing of the two levels. In this paper, we present analytical results that
give quantitative account of the breakdown of adiabaticity by mapping this
quantum nonlinear model into a classical Josephson Hamiltonian. In the critical
region, we find a power-law scaling of the nonadiabatic transition probability
as a function of $C/V-1$ and $\alpha $, the crossing rate of the energy levels.
In the subcritical regime, the transition probability still follows an
exponential law but with the exponent changed by the nonlinear effect. For
$C/V&gt;&gt;1$, we find a near unit probability for the transition between the
adiabatic levels for all values of the crossing rate.

q-deformed harmonic oscillator correctly predicts all experimentally observed
magic numbers up to 1500 (which is the expected limit of validity for theories
based on the filling of electronic shells), while in addition it gives
satisfactory results for the magic numbers of clusters of divalent metals and
trivalent metals, thus indicating that Uq(3), which is a nonlinear extension of
the U(3) symmetry of the spherical (3-dimensional isotropic) harmonic
oscillator, is a good candidate for being the symmetry of systems of several
metal clusters. The Taylor expansions of angular momentum dependent potentials

  computers</title><description>  We study the robustness of quantum computers under the influence of errors
modelled by strictly contractive channels. A channel $T$ is defined to be
strictly contractive if, for any pair of density operators $\rho,\sigma$ in its
domain, $\| T\rho - T\sigma \|_1 \le k \| \rho-\sigma \|_1$ for some $0 \le k &lt;
1$ (here $\| \cdot \|_1$ denotes the trace norm). In other words, strictly
contractive channels render the states of the computer less distinguishable in
the sense of quantum detection theory. Starting from the premise that all
experimental procedures can be carried out with finite precision, we argue that
there exists a physically meaningful connection between strictly contractive
channels and errors in physically realizable quantum computers. We show that,
in the absence of error correction, sensitivity of quantum memories and
computers to strictly contractive errors grows exponentially with storage time
and computation time respectively, and depends only on the constant $k$ and the
measurement precision. We prove that strict contractivity rules out the
possibility of perfect error correction, and give an argument that approximate
error correction, which covers previous work on fault-tolerant quantum
computation as a special case, is possible.

which is by itself the exact lowest even or odd eigenstate of a different
Hamiltonian with a modified potential $V+\delta V$, we construct the Green's
function for the modified potential. The true wave functions, $\psi_{ev}$ or
$\psi_{od}$, then satisfies a linear inhomogeneous integral equation, in which
the inhomogeneous term is the trial function, and the kernel is the product of
the Green's function times the sum of $\delta V$, the potential difference, and
the corresponding energy shift. By iterating this equation we obtain successive
approximations to the true wave function; furthermore, the approximate energy
shift is also adjusted at each iteration so that the approximate wave function
is well behaved everywhere. We are able to prove that this iterative procedure
converges for both the energy and the wave function at all $x$.

Their use in physics became popular with the introduction of the q-deformed

a nonequilibrium initial state. Boltzmann only replied ``then go and invert
them''. This problem of the relationship between the microscopic and
macroscopic descriptions of the physical world and time-reversibility has been
hotly debated from the XIXth century up to nowadays. At present, no modern
computer is able to perform Boltzmann's demand for a macroscopic number of

imprecision in the inversion that leads to practical irreversibility. Here we
show that a quantum computer composed of a few tens of qubits, and operating

  Anomalously slow decoherence</title><description>  Relaxation of a two-level system (TLS) into a resonant infinite-temperature
reservoir with a Lorentzian spectrum is studied. The reservoir is described by
a complex Gaussian-Markovian field coupled to the nondiagonal elements of the
TLS Hamiltonian. The theory can be relevant for electromagnetic interactions in
microwave high-$Q$ cavities and muon spin depolarization. Analytical results
are obtained for the strong-coupling regime, $\Omega_0\gg\nu$, where $\Omega_0$
is the rms coupling amplitude (Rabi frequency) and $\nu$ is the width of the
reservoir spectrum. In this regime, the population difference and half of the
initial coherence decay with two characteristic rates: the most part of the
decay occurs at $t\sim\Omega_0^{-1}$, the relaxation being reversible for
$t\ll(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$, whereas for $t\gg(\Omega_0^2\nu)^{-1/3}$ the
relaxation becomes irreversible and is practically over. The other half of the
coherence decays with the rate on the order of $\nu$, which may be slower by
orders of magnitude than the time scale of the population relaxation. The above
features are explained by the fact that at $t\ll\nu^{-1}$ the reservoir
temporal fluctuations are effectively one-dimensional (adiabatic). Moreover, we
identify the pointer basis, in which the reduction of the state vector occurs.
The pointer states are correlated with the reservoir, being dependent on the
reservoir phase.

$\AC^0$ of constant-depth circuits with AND and OR gates of arbitrary fan-in,
and $\QACC[q]$, the analog of the class $\ACC[q]$ where $\Mod_q$ gates are also
allowed. We prove that parity or fanout allows us to construct quantum $\MOD_q$
gates in constant depth for any $q$, so $\QACC[2] = \QACC$. More generally, we
show that for any $q,p &gt; 1$, $\MOD_q$ is equivalent to $\MOD_p$ (up to constant
depth). This implies that $\QAC^0$ with unbounded fanout gates, denoted
$\QACwf^0$, is the same as $\QACC[q]$ and $\QACC$ for all $q$. Since $\ACC[p]
\ne \ACC[q]$ whenever $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, $\QACC[q]$ is strictly
more powerful than its classical counterpart, as is $\QAC^0$ when fanout is
allowed. This adds to the growing list of quantum complexity classes which are
provably more powerful than their classical counterparts.
  We also develop techniques for proving upper bounds for $\QACC^0$ in terms of
related language classes. We define classes of languages $\EQACC$, $\NQACC$ and
$\BQACC_{\rats}$. We define a notion of $\log$-planar $\QACC$ operators and
show the appropriately restricted versions of $\EQACC$ and $\NQACC$ are

  protocols</title><description>  Although it is impossible for a bit commitment protocol to be both
arbitrarily concealing and arbitrarily binding, it is possible for it to be
both partially concealing and partially binding. This means that Bob cannot,
prior to the beginning of the unveiling phase, find out everything about the
bit committed, and Alice cannot, through actions taken after the end of the
commitment phase, unveil whatever bit she desires. We determine upper bounds on
the degrees of concealment and bindingness that can be achieved simultaneously
in any bit commitment protocol, although it is unknown whether these can be
saturated. We do, however, determine the maxima of these quantities in a
restricted class of bit commitment protocols, namely those wherein all the
systems that play a role in the commitment phase are supplied by Alice. We show
that these maxima can be achieved using a protocol that requires Alice to
prepare a pair of systems in an entangled state, submit one of the pair to Bob
at the commitment phase, and the other at the unveiling phase. Finally, we
determine the form of the trade-off that exists between the degree of
concealment and the degree of bindingness given various assumptions about the
purity and dimensionality of the states used in the protocol.

Above six qubits very few states have any pairwise entanglement, and generally,

interaction with the environment. As it has been pointed out first by Dicke, in
a system of N two-level atoms where each of the atoms is individually dipole
coupled to the environment, there are collective, subradiant states, that have
no dipole coupling to photon modes, and therefore they are expected to decay
slower. This property also implies that these type of states, which form an N-1
dimensional subspace of the atomic subsytem, also decohere slower. We propose a
scheme which will create such states. First the two-level atoms are placed in a
strongly detuned cavity and one of the atoms, called the control atom is
excited. The time evolution of the coupled atom-cavity system leads to an
appropriately entangled state of the atoms. By applying subsequent laser pulses
at a well defined time instant, it is possible to drive the atomic state into
the subradiant, i. e., decoherence free subspace. Up to a certain average
number of the photons, the result is independent of the state of the cavity.
The analysis of the conditions shows that this scheme is feasible with present
day techniques achieved in atom cavity interaction experiments.

employed sideband cooling method, first studied by Vuletic et al.\cite{Vule98},
uses Raman transitions between Zeeman levels and produces a spin-polarized
sample. We present a detailed study of this cooling method and investigate the
role of elastic collisions in the system. We accumulate $83(5)%$ of the atoms

collisions cool the transverse motion to a temperature of $2.8 \mu $K=$0.7

for providing secret communications that cannot be decrypted by any amount of
computational effort. This is the first analysis of the secrecy of a practical
implementation of the BB84 protocol that simultaneously takes into account and
presents the {\it full} set of complete analytical expressions for effects due
to the presence of pulses containing multiple photons in the attenuated output
of the laser, the finite length of individual blocks of key material, losses
due to error correction, privacy amplification, continuous authentication,
errors in polarization detection, the efficiency of the detectors, and
attenuation processes in the transmission medium. The analysis addresses
eavesdropping attacks on individual photons rather than collective attacks in
general. Of particular importance is the first derivation of the necessary and
sufficient amount of privacy amplification compression to ensure secrecy
against the loss of key material which occurs when an eavesdropper makes
optimized individual attacks on pulses containing multiple photons. It is shown
that only a fraction of the information in the multiple photon pulses is
actually lost to the eavesdropper.

generalize the formalism of conditional master equations to the multiple
observer case. To settle some issues of principle which arise in this context

we consider an example of a system qubit interacting through controlled nots

find out for observers who measure in a basis of the environment which is most
correlated with the pointer basis of the system. In this case the observers
agree the most. Furthermore, the more predictable the pointers are, the easier
it is to find the state of the system, and the better is the agreement between
different observers.

and outlines its explicite construction -- some analogies and contrasts with
other logics of dynamics are indicated. Abstract: The development of ``(static)
operational quantum logic&quot; points out that classical boolean structures are too
rigid to describe the actual and potential properties of quantum systems. On
the other hand, an intuitionistic perspective on operational quantum logic,
guides us in the direction of incorporating dynamics logically by reconsidering
the primitive propositions required to describe the behavior of a quantum
system, in particular in view of the emergent disjunctivity due to the
non-determinism of quantum measurements. A further elaboration on
&quot;intuitionistic quantum logic&quot; emerges into a &quot;dynamic operational quantum
logic&quot;, which allows us to express dynamic reasoning in the sense that we can
capture how actual properties propagate, including their temporal causal
structure, and provides a unified logical description of systems which evolve
or which are submitted to measurements. This setting reveals that even static
operational quantum logic bears a hidden dynamic ingredient in terms of what is
called &quot;the orthomodularity&quot; of the lattice-structure. Focusing on the quantale
semantics for dynamic operational quantum logic, we delineate some points of
difference with the existing quantale semantics for (non)-commutative linear
logic.

the Casimir effect. The Casimir effect results from the alteration by the
boundaries of the zero-point electromagnetic energy. Unique to the Casimir
force is its strong dependence on shape, switching from attractive to repulsive
as function of the size, geometry and topology of the boundary. Thus the
Casimir force is a direct manifestation of the boundary dependence of quantum
vacuum.
  We discuss in depth the general structure of the infinities in the field
theory which are removed by a combination of zeta-functional regularization and
heat kernel expansion. Different representations for the regularized vacuum
energy are given. The Casimir energies and forces in a number of configurations
of interest to applications are calculated. We stress the development of the
Casimir force for real media including effects of nonzero temperature, finite
conductivity of the boundary metal and surface roughness. Also the combined
effect of these important factors is investigated in detail on the basis of
condensed matter physics and quantum field theory at nonzero temperature.
  The experiments on measuring the Casimir force are also reviewed, starting
first with the older measurements and finishing with a detailed presentation of
modern precision experiments. The latter are accurately compared with the
theoretical results for real media.
  At the end of the review we provide the most recent constraints on the
corrections to Newtonian gravitational law and other hypothetical long-range
interactions at submillimeter range obtained from the Casimir force
measurements.

only the individual measurements and classical codes and, in addition, the key
distribution problem allows to postpone the choice of the state encoding scheme
until after the states are already received instead of choosing it before
sending the states into the communication channel (i.e. to employ a sort of
``antedate'' coding).

the amount of information per channel use that can be sent over the channel in
the limit of many uses of the channel, assuming that the sender and receiver

up by the communication protocol. We show that this capacity is given by an

i.e., the maximum, over channel inputs $\rho$, of the entropy of the channel
input plus the entropy of the channel output minus their joint entropy, the
latter being defined as the entropy of an entangled purification of $\rho$
after half of it has passed through the channel. We calculate
entanglement-assisted capacities for two interesting quantum channels, the
qubit amplitude damping channel and the bosonic channel with
amplification/attenuation and Gaussian noise. We discuss how many independent
parameters are required to completely characterize the asymptotic behavior of a
general quantum channel, alone or in the presence of ancillary resources such
as prior entanglement. In the classical analog of entanglement assisted
communication--communication over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) between
parties who share prior random information--we show that one parameter is
sufficient, i.e., that in the presence of prior shared random information, all
DMC's of equal capacity can simulate one another with unit asymptotic

sense the entangled system is considered inseparable and nonlocal. It is
generally believed that entanglement manifests itself mostly in systems
consisting of a small number of microscopic particles. Here we demonstrate
experimentally the entanglement of two objects, each consisting of about 10^12
atoms. Entanglement is generated via interaction of the two objects - more
precisely, two gas samples of cesium atoms - with a pulse of light, which
performs a non-local Bell measurement on collective spins of the samples. The
entangled spin state can be maintained for 0.5 millisecond. Besides being of
fundamental interest, the robust, long-lived entanglement of material objects
demonstrated here is expected to be useful in quantum information processing,
including teleportation of quantum states of matter and quantum memory.

what is the largest possible value Emax(n,d) of the minimum entanglement

formation as our measure of entanglement.) For n=3 and d=2, that is, for a

we consider first a system of d qudits and show that Emax(d,d) is greater than

infinite square well with a time periodic pulsed field is investigated. This is
a two-parameter non-KAM generalization of the kicked rotor, which can be seen
as the standard map of particles subjected to both smooth and hard potentials.
The virtue of the generalization lies in the introduction of an extra parameter
R which is the ratio of two length scales, namely the well width and the field
wavelength. If R is a non-integer the dynamics is discontinuous and non-KAM. We
have explored the role of R in controlling the localization properties of the
eigenstates. In particular the connection between classical diffusion and
localization is found to generalize reasonably well. In unbounded chaotic
systems such as these, while the nearest neighbour spacing distribution of the
eigenvalues is less sensitive to the nature of the classical dynamics, the
distribution of participation ratios of the eigenstates proves to be a
sensitive measure; in the chaotic regimes the latter being lognormal. We find
that the tails of the well converged localized states are exponentially
localized despite the discontinuous dynamics while the bulk part shows
fluctuations that tend to be closer to Random Matrix Theory predictions. Time
evolving states show considerable R dependence and tuning R to enhance
classical diffusion can lead to significantly larger quantum diffusion for the
same field strengths, an effect that is potentially observable in present day
experiments.

relative number squeezed particles can be achieved when atoms with momentum
$k$, produced in pairs through collisions in the condensate, are scattered out
by their interaction with the lasers. This squeezing is optimal when the
momentum $k$ is larger than the inverse healing length, $k&gt;k_0$. This modest
number of relative number squeezed particles has the potential to be amplified
in four-wave-mixing experiments.

effective volume in phase space occupied by the Husimi distribution, and has a
good correspondence with chaoticity of classical system. Its properties are
similar to the classical entropy proposed by Wehrl, but it is much easier to
calculate numerically. We calculate this quantity in the quartic oscillator
model, and show that it works well as a measure of chaoticity of quantum

the Schroedinger equation, it is well-known that systems of Fermions still pose
a challenge. Thus far all solutions to the &quot;sign problem&quot; remain inefficient
(or wrong). The fixed-node approach, however, is efficient, and in many
situations remains the best approach. If only we could find the exact nodes, or
at least a systematic way to improve the nodes, we would, in effect, bypass the
sign problem. Unfortunately, very little is known about wave function nodes,
and a systematic study has never been attempted, despite the obvious
consequences for improving quantum simulations that such knowledge might
generate. In this paper we study the nodal surfaces of simple atomic systems.

a multiparticle setting, which was first studied by Doran, Gull and Lasenby.
The geometric interpretation of this algebra, which it inherits from its
one-particle factors, possesses a number of physically compelling features,
including simple derivations of the Pauli exclusion principle and other
nonlocal effects in quantum physics. Of particular importance here is the fact
that all the operations needed in the quantum (statistical) mechanics of spin
1/2 particles can be carried out in the ``even subalgebra'' of the MSTA. This
enables us to ``lift'' existing results in quantum information theory regarding
entanglement, decoherence and the quantum/classical transition to space-time.
The full power of the MSTA and its geometric interpretation can then be used to
obtain new insights into these foundational issues in quantum theory. A system
of spin 1/2 particles located at fixed positions in space, and interacting with
an external magnetic field and/or with one another via their intrinsic magnetic
dipoles provides a simple paradigm for the study of these issues. This paradigm
can further be easily realized and studied in the laboratory by nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

related. In fact, the family of normalized tight frames for the space in which
a quantum mechanical system lies is precisely the family of rank-one
generalized quantum measurements (POVMs) on that space. Using this
relationship, frame-theoretical analogues of various quantum-mechanical
concepts and results are developed.
  The analogue of a least-squares quantum measurement is a tight frame that is
closest in a least-squares sense to a given set of vectors. The least-squares
tight frame is found for both the case in which the scaling of the frame is
specified (constrained least-squares frame (CLSF)) and the case in which the
scaling is free (unconstrained least-squares frame (ULSF)). The well-known
canonical frame is shown to be proportional to the ULSF and to coincide with
the CLSF with a certain scaling.
  Finally, the canonical frame vectors corresponding to a geometrically uniform
vector set are shown to be geometrically uniform and to have the same
symmetries as the original vector set.

degree of freedom. Further extensions are to systems containing many fermions,
with the master equations modified to take Fermi-Dirac statistics into account,
and to potentials with a time-dependent bias that induce resonant avoided

the bath is much greater than all free oscillation rates for the system, is
interrogated. Two behaviors are possible: freezing (quantum Zeno effect) or
synchronization (motional narrowing). We clarify the conditions that give rise
to each possibility, making an explicit connection with quantum measurement

quantum field theory has formed the basis for theoretical investigations in the
discipline known as random or stochastic electrodynamics (SED) wherein quantum
measurements are imitated by the introduction of a stochastic classical
background EM field. Random EM fluctuations are assumed to provide
perturbations which can mimic some quantum phenomena while retaining a purely
classical basis, e.g. the Casimir force, the Van-der-Waals force, the Lamb
shift, spontaneous emission, the RMS radius of the harmonic oscillator, and the
radius of the Bohr atom. This classical ZPF is represented as a homogeneous,
isotropic ensemble of plane waves with fixed amplitudes and random phases.
Averaging over the random phases is assumed to be equivalent to taking the
ground-state expectation values of the corresponding quantum operator. We
demonstrate that this is not precisely correct by examining the statistics of
the classical ZPF in contrast to that of the EM quantum vacuum. We derive the
distribution for the individual mode amplitudes in the ground-state as
predicted by quantum field theory (QFT) and then carry out the same calculation
for the classical ZPF analogue, showing that the distributions are only in
approximate agreement, diverging as the density of k states decreases. We
introduce an alternative classical ZPF with a different stochastic character,
and demonstrate that it can exactly reproduce the statistics of the EM vacuum
of QED. Incorporated into SED, this new field is shown to give the correct (QM)
distribution for the amplitude of the ground-state of a harmonic oscillator,
suggesting the possibility of developing further successful correspondences
between SED and QED.

These effective Hamiltonians are useful for coherence transfer experiments and

processes without a birth process that will generate the Dirac equation in 1+1
dimensions. The Markov process is assumed to evolve in an extra (ordinal) time
dimension. The derivation requires that occupation by the Dirac particle of a
space-time lattice site is encoded in a 4 state classical probability vector.
Disregarding the state occupancy, the resulting Markov process is a homogeneous
and almost isotropic binary random walk in Dirac space and Dirac time
(including Dirac time reversals). It then emerges that the Dirac wavefunction
can be identified with a polarization induced by the walk on the Dirac
space-time lattice. The model predicts that QM observation must happen in
ordinal time, and that wavefunction collapse is due not to a dynamical
discontinuity, but to selection of a particular ordinal time. Consequently, the
model is more relativistically equitable in its treatment of space and time in
that the observer is attributed no special ability to specify the Dirac time of
observation.

Feynman approach to quantum theory in combination with the canonical approach
allows one to extend quantum dynamics to describe the time evolution in the
case of such interactions. In this way, using only the current concepts of

In the case, where the fundamental interaction generating the dynamics in a

proposed formalism is shown to provide a new insight into the problem of the

such a property of the equation of motion as nonlocality in time may be

interaction between the two corresponding particles is active. For networks
with different gyromagnetic ratios, we provide a necessary and sufficient
condition of controllability in terms of the properties of the above mentioned

all the controllability notions, including the possibility of driving the

controllability. A general form of interaction among the particles is assumed
which includes both Ising and Heisenberg models as special cases.

is shown to be strongly influenced by the shape of the classical orbits of the
underlying classical phase space: we find a one-to-one correspondence between
maxima (minima) of the linear entropy and maxima (minima) of the expectation
value of atomic excitation J_z. Since the expectation value of this operator
can be viewed as related to the orbit radius in the classical phase space
projection associated to the atomic degree of freedom, the proximity of the
quantum wave packet to this atomic phase space borderline produces a maximum
rate of entanglement. The consequence of this fact for initial conditions
centered at periodic orbits in regular regions is a clear periodic recoherence.
For chaotic situations the same phenomenon (proximity of the atomic phase space
borderline) is in general responsible for oscillations in the entanglement
properties.

mechanics, is at the heart of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and of the so
called quantum-nonlocality - the fact that a local realistic explanation of
quantum mechanics is not possible as quantitatively expressed by violation of
Bell's inequalities. Even as entanglement gains increasing importance in most
quantum information processing protocols, its conceptual foundation is still
widely debated. Among the open questions are: What is the conceptual meaning of
quantum entanglement? What are the most general constraints imposed by local
realism? Which general quantum states violate these constraints? Developing
Schroedinger's ideas in an information-theoretic context we suggest that a
natural understanding of quantum entanglement results when one accepts (1) that
the amount of information per elementary system is finite and (2) that the
information in a composite system resides more in the correlations than in
properties of individuals. The quantitative formulation of these ideas leads to
a rather natural criterion of quantum entanglement. Independently, extending
Bell's original ideas, we obtain a single general Bell inequality that
summarizes all possible constraints imposed by local realism on the
correlations for a multi-particle system. Violation of the general Bell
inequality results in an independent general criterion for quantum
entanglement. Most importantly, the two criteria agree in essence, though the
two approaches are conceptually very different. This concurrence strongly
supports the information-theoretic interpretation of quantum entanglement and
of quantum physics in general.

description of the quantum subensembles of transmitted and reflected particles
both at the final and initial stage of tunneling. We find the initial states of
both subensembles, which are non-orthogonal. The latter reflects ultimately the
fact that at the initial stage of tunneling it is impossible to predict whether
a particle will be transmitted through or reflected off the barrier. At the
same time, in this case, one can say about the to-be-transmitted and
to-be-reflected subensembles of particles. We show that before the interaction
of the incident packet with the barrier both the number of particles and the
expectation value of the particle's momentum are constant for each subensemble.
Besides, these asymptotic quantities coincide with those of the corresponding
scattered subensemble. On the basis of this formalism we define individual
delay times for both scattering channels. Taking into account the spreading of
wave packets, we define the low bound of the scattering time to describe the
whole quantum ensemble of particles. All three characteristic times are derived
in terms of the expectation values of the position and momentum operators. The
condition which must be fulfilled for completed scattering events is derived.
We propose also the scheme of a {\it gedanken} experiment that allows one to

cognitive entities (i.e. sets of connected propositions) by taking into account
in a very explicit way the possible influence of the cognitive person (the one
that interacts with the considered cognitive entity). Hereby we specifically
apply the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics because of the fact that
this formalism allows the description of real contextual influences, i.e. the
influence of the measuring apparatus on the physical entity. We concentrated on
the typical situation of the liar paradox and have shown that (1) the
truth-false state of this liar paradox can be represented by a quantum vector
of the non-product type in a finite dimensional complex Hilbert space and the
different cognitive interactions by the actions of the corresponding quantum
projections, (2) the typical oscillations between false and truth - the paradox
-is now quantum dynamically described by a Schrodinger equation. We analyse
possible philosophical implications of this result.

taking into account the results that have been obtained during the last two
decades by investigations in the field of `quantum structures research'. We
concentrate mostly on the results of our group FUND at Brussels Free
University. By means of a spin 1/2 model where the quantum probability is
generated by the presence of fluctuations on the interactions between measuring
apparatus and physical system, we show that the quantum structure can find its
origin in the presence of these fluctuations. This appraoch, that we have
called the 'hidden measurement approach', makes it possible to construct
systems that are in between quantum and classical. We show that two of the
traditional axioms of quantum axiomatics are not satisfied for these 'in
between quantum and classical' situations, and how this structural shortcoming
of standard quantum mechanics is at the origin of most of the quantum
paradoxes. We show that in this approach the EPR paradox identifies a genuine
incompleteness of standard quantum mechanics, however not an incompleteness
that means the lacking of hidden variables, but an incompleteness pointing at
the impossibility for standard quantum mechanics to describe separated quantum
systems. We indicate in which way, by redefining the meaning of density states,
standard quantum mechanics can be completed. We put forward in which way the
axiomatic approach to quantum mechanics can be compared to the traditional
axiomatic approach to relativity theory, and how this might lead to studying
another road to unification of both theories.

is derived by elementary means and shown to be quite useful. The inequality
applies to 'all' operators and 'all' pairs of quantum states, including mixed
states. It generalizes the rule of the orthogonality of eigenvectors for
distinct eigenvalues and is shown to imply all the Robertson generalized
uncertainty relations. It severely constrains the difference between
probabilities obtained from 'close' quantum states and the different responses
they can have to unitary transformations. Thus, it is dubbed a master
inequality. With appropriate definitions the inequality also holds throughout
general probability theory and appears not to be well known there either. That
classical inequality is obtained here in an appendix. The quantum inequality
can be obtained from the classical version but a more direct quantum approach
is employed here. A similar but weaker classical inequality has been reported
by Uffink and van Lith.

degree of belief for a single trial, without any a priori connection to
limiting frequencies. In this paper we show that, despite being prescribed by a
fundamental law, probabilities for individual quantum systems can be understood
within the Bayesian approach. We argue that the distinction between classical
and quantum probabilities lies not in their definition, but in the nature of
the information they encode. In the classical world, maximal information about
a physical system is complete in the sense of providing definite answers for
all possible questions that can be asked of the system. In the quantum world,
maximal information is not complete and cannot be completed. Using this
distinction, we show that any Bayesian probability assignment in quantum
mechanics must have the form of the quantum probability rule, that maximal
information about a quantum system leads to a unique quantum-state assignment,
and that quantum theory provides a stronger connection between probability and
measured frequency than can be justified classically. Finally we give a
Bayesian formulation of quantum-state tomography.

arbitrary (pure or impure) Gaussian input states. Specifically, nonclassicality
of the input Gaussian fields is a necessary condition for entanglement of the

systems of interacting particles. The key point of this approach is that a
typical eigenstate in the energy representation (shape of eigenstates, SE) has
a well defined classical analog which can be easily obtained from the classical
equations of motion. Therefore, the occupation numbers for single-particle
states can be represented as a convolution of the classical SE with the quantum
occupation number operator for non-interacting particles. The latter takes into
account the wavefunctions symmetry and depends on the unperturbed energy
spectrum only. As a result, the distribution of occupation numbers $n_s$ can be
numerically found for a very large number of interacting particles. Using the
model of interacting spins we demonstrate that this approach gives a correct
description of $n_s$ even in a deep quantum region with few single-particle
orbitals.

decay rate is found from the analysis of the set of the particle Hamiltonian
trajectories in complex phase space and time. In a magnetic field, the
tunneling particle comes out from the barrier with a finite velocity and behind
the boundary of the classically allowed region. The exit location is obtained
by matching the decaying and outgoing WKB waves at a caustic in complex

switching surface in real space, where the slope of the wave function sharply
changes. The theory is not limited to tunneling from potential wells which are

First we generalize a method for proving classical communication complexity
lower bounds developed by Raz to the quantum case. Applying this method we give
an exponential separation between bounded error quantum communication
complexity and nondeterministic quantum communication complexity. We develop
several other lower bound methods based on the Fourier transform, notably
showing that \sqrt{\bar{s}(f)/\log n}, for the average sensitivity \bar{s}(f)
of a function f, yields a lower bound on the bounded error quantum
communication complexity of f(x AND y XOR z), where x is a Boolean word held by
Alice and y,z are Boolean words held by Bob. We then prove the first large
lower bounds on the bounded error quantum communication complexity of
functions, for which a polynomial quantum speedup is possible. For all the
functions we investigate, the only previously applied general lower bound
method based on discrepancy yields bounds that are O(\log n).

rather special geometric black hole setting in which the geometric
manifestations of these properties were first noted. This new setting is also
the natural arena for understanding the rich world of ``black hole analogs''
(``dumb holes'' for phonons). The mathematical basis for all this is the
extremely powerful Tomita-Takesaki modular theory in operator algebras. The
rich consequences of the impressive blend of this theory with physical
localization entails among other things the presence of ``fuzzy'' acting
infinite dimensional symmetry groups, a spacetime interpretation and derivation
of the d=1+1 Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra (i.e. a better understanding of the
bootstrap-formfactor approach) and the noncommutative multiparticle structure
of ``free'' anyons based on the use of Wigner representation theory.

  qubit sets</title><description>  We demonstrate a class of optimum detection strategies for extracting the
maximum information from sets of equiprobable real symmetric qubit states of a
single photon. These optimum strategies have been predicted by Sasaki et al.
[Phys. Rev. A{\bf 59}, 3325 (1999)]. The peculiar aspect is that the detections
with at least three outputs suffice for optimum extraction of information
regardless of the number of signal elements. The cases of ternary (or trine),
quinary, and septenary polarization signals are studied where a standard von
Neumann detection (a projection onto a binary orthogonal basis) fails to access
the maximum information. Our experiments demonstrate that it is possible with
present technologies to attain about 96% of the theoretical limit.

  Covariant approach</title><description>  We propose a fibre bundle formulation of the mathematical base of
relativistic quantum mechanics. At the present stage the bundle form of the
theory is equivalent to its conventional one, but it admits new types of
generalizations in different directions.
  In the present, second, part of our investigation, we consider a covariant
approach to bundle description of relativistic quantum mechanics.
  In it the wavefunctions are replaced with (state) sections of a suitably
chosen vector bundle over space-time whose (standard) fibre is the space of the
wavefunctions. Now the quantum evolution is described as a linear
transportation (by means of the transport along the identity map of the
space\nobreakdash-time) of the state sections in the (total) bundle space.
Connections between the (retarded) Green functions of the relativistic wave
equations and the evolution operators and transports are found. Especially the
Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations are considered.

rules, its parameters are empirical, either deduced from classical physics, or
from experimental results rather than from the postulates. Thus, quantum
mechanics is purely phenomenological; for instance, the computation of the
eigenvalues of the energy is generally a simple interpolation in the discrete
space of the quantum numbers. The attempts to show that quantum electrodynamics
is more precise than classical electrodynamics are based on wrong computations.
The lack of paradoxes in the classical theory, the appearance of classical,
true interpretations of the wave-particle duality justify the criticism of
Ehrenfest and Einstein.
  The obscurity of the quantum concepts leads to wrong conclusions that
handicap the development of physics. Just as building a laser was considered
absurd before the first maser worked, the concept of photon leads to deny a
type of coherent Raman scattering necessary to understand some redshifts of

We show by an explicit expression that the phase matching condition depends
both on the unitary transformation U and the initial state. Assuming that the
initial amplitude distribution is an arbitrary superposition sin\theta_0 |1&gt; +
cos\theta_0 e^{i\delta} |2&gt; with |1&gt; = {1 / sin\beta} \sum_k |\tau_k&gt;

|\tau_k&gt; is a marked state and \sin\beta = \sqrt{\sum_k|U_{\tau_k 0}|^2} is
determined by the matrix elements of unitary transformation U between |\tau_k&gt;
and the |0&gt; state, then the general phase matching condition is tan{\theta / 2}
[cos 2\beta + tan\theta_0 cos\delta sin 2\beta]= tan{\phi / 2} [1-tan\theta_0
sin\delta sin 2\beta tan{\theta / 2}], where \theta and \phi are the phase
rotation angles for |0&gt; and |\tau_k&gt;, respectively. This generalizes previous
conclusions in which the dependence of phase matching condition on $U$ and the
initial state has been disguised. We show that several phase conditions
previously discussed in the literature are special cases of this general one,
which clarifies the question of which condition should be regarded as exact.

quant-ph/0001106]. We apply this time-dependent Hamiltonian approach to the
Grover's problem, i. e., searching a marked item in an unstructured database.
We find that, by adjusting the evolution rate of the Hamiltonian so as to keep
the evolution adiabatic on each infinitesimal time interval, the total running
time is of order $\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of items in the database.
We thus recover the advantage of Grover's standard algorithm as compared to a
classical search, scaling as $N$. This is in contrast with the constant-rate
adiabatic approach developed by Farhi et al., where the requirement of
adiabaticity is expressed only globally, resulting in a time of order $N$.

propagation of a wave in the presence of disorder have been extensively
studied, as exemplified in coherent backscattering (CBS) of light. In the
multiple scattering of light by a disordered sample of thermal atoms,
interference effects are usually washed out by the fast atomic motion. This is
no longer true for cold atoms where CBS has recently been observed. However,
the internal structure of the atoms strongly influences the interference
properties. In this paper, we consider light scattering by an atomic dipole
transition with arbitrary degeneracy and study its impact on coherent
backscattering. We show that the interference contrast is strongly reduced.
Assuming a uniform statistical distribution over internal degrees of freedom,
we compute analytically the single and double scattering contributions to the

enhancement factors and backscattering intensity profiles for polarized light

of a single quantum system and use their data to deduce its state. We derive a
set of conditional stochastic master equations that describe the evolution of
the density matrices each observer ascribes to the system under the Markov
approximation, and show that this problem can be reduced to the case of a
single &quot;super-observer&quot;, who has access to all the acquired data. The key
problem - consistency of the sets of data acquired by different observers - is
then reduced to the probability that a given combination of data sets will be
ever detected by the &quot;super-observer&quot;. The resulting conditional master
equations are applied to several physical examples: homodyne detection of
phonons in quantum Brownian motion, photo-detection and homodyne detection of
resonance fluorescence from a two-level atom. We introduce {\it relative
purity} to quantify the correlations between the information about the system
gathered by different observers from their measurements of the environment. We
find that observers gain the most information about the state of the system and
they agree the most about it when they measure the environment observables with
eigenstates most closely correlated with the optimally predictable {\it pointer
basis} of the system.

deterministic simulation involving one copy of the system. More specifically,
two otherwise isolated systems $A$ and $B$ interact by a nonlocal Hamiltonian
$H \neq H_A+H_B$. We consider the achievable space of Hamiltonians $H'$ such
that the evolution $e^{-iH't}$ can be simulated by the interaction $H$

nonlocal Hamiltonians $H$ and $H'$, there exists a scale factor $s$ such that
for all times $t$ the evolution $e^{-iH'st}$ can be simulated by $H$ acting for

bosons and fermions, but not from quons. In this paper we construct bosons and
fermions from quon operators. For bosons, our construction works for $-1 \leq q

Vietoris-type of topology and subsequently they are sheafified with respect to
it. The category resulting from this sheafification procedure is the topos of
sheaves of sets varying continuously over the Vietoris-topologized base poset
category of Boolean subalgebras of the universal orthoalgebra of quantum
history propositions. The second extension of Isham's topos consists in
endowing the stalks of the aforementioned sheaves, which were originally
inhabited by structureless sets, with further algebraic structure, that also
enjoys a quantum causal interpretation, so as to arrive at the topos of
consistent-histories of quantum causal sets. The resulting quantum causal
histories topos is compared with Markopoulou's quantum causal histories, with
Mallios and this author's finitary spacetime sheaves of quantum causal sets, as

  with a Large Number of Qubits</title><description>  The perturbation theory is developed based on small parameters which
naturally appear in solid state quantum computation. We report the simulations
of the dynamics of quantum logic operations with a large number of qubits (up
to 1000). A nuclear spin chain is considered in which selective excitations of
spins are provided by having a uniform gradient of the external magnetic field.
Quantum logic operations are utilized by applying resonant electromagnetic
pulses. The spins interact with their nearest neighbors. We simulate the
creation of the long-distance entanglement between remote qubits in the spin
chain. Our method enables us to minimize unwanted non-resonant effects in a
controlled way. The method we use cannot simulate complicated quantum logic (a
quantum computer is required to do this), but it can be useful to test the
experimental performance of simple quantum logic operations. We show that: (a)
the probability distribution of unwanted states has a ``band'' structure, (b)
the directions of spins in typical unwanted states are highly correlated, and
(c) many of the unwanted states are high-energy states of a quantum computer (a
spin chain). Our approach can be applied to simple quantum logic gates and
fragments of quantum algorithms involving a large number of qubits.

by expanding the vector potential in terms of non-Hermitean (Fox-Li) modes in
both the cavity and external regions. The cavity non-Hermitean modes (NHM) are
treated using the paraxial and monochromaticity approximations. The NHM
bi-orthogonality relationships are used in a standard canonical quantization
procedure based on introducing generalised coordinates and momenta for the
electromagnetic (EM) field. The quantum EM field is equivalent to a set of
quantum harmonic oscillators (QHO), associated with either the cavity or the
external region NHM. This confirms the validity of the photon model in unstable
optical systems, though the annihilation and creation operators for each QHO
are not Hermitean adjoints. The quantum Hamiltonian for the EM field is the sum
of non-commuting cavity and external region contributions, each of which is sum
of independent QHO Hamiltonians for each NHM, but the external field
Hamiltonian also includes a coupling term responsible for external NHM photon
exchange processes. Cavity energy gain and loss processes is associated with
the non-commutativity of cavity and external region operators, given in terms
of surface integrals involving cavity and external region NHM functions on the
cavity-external region boundary. The spontaneous decay of a two-level atom
inside an unstable cavity is treated using the essential states approach and
the rotating wave approximation. Atomic transitions leading to cavity NHM
photon absorption have a different coupling constant to those leading to photon
emission, a feature resulting from the use of NHM functions. Under certain
conditions the decay rate is enhanced by the Petermann factor.

is represented in the form of definite physical mechanisms. Our way is
completely different from so-called hidden parameter models, namely, we start
from a certain variant of QM - deterministic QM - which has most features
similar to QM, but the evolution in this theory is deterministic. Then we
introduce the subquantum medium composed of so-called space-like objects. The
interaction of a deterministic QM-particle with this medium is represented by
the random force, but it is the random force governed by the probability
amplitude distribution. This is the quantum random force and it is very
different from classical random force. This implies that in our models there
are no Bell`s inequalities and that our models (depending on a certain
parameter tau) can be arbitrarily close to QM. The parameter tau defines a
relaxation time and on time intervals shorter than tau, the evolution violates
Heisenberg`s uncertainty principle and it is almost deterministic - spreading
of the wave packet is much slower than in QM. Such type of short-time effects
form the bases of proposed tests, which can, in principle, define limits of
validity of QM. The proposed experiments are related to the behavior of quantum
objects on short time intervals, where we expect the behavior different from
QM. The main proposed feature is violation of uncertainty relations on short
time intervals.

  bit commitment protocol</title><description>  It is well known that no quantum bit commitment protocol is unconditionally
secure. Nonetheless, there can be non-trivial upper bounds on both Bob's
probability of correctly estimating Alice's commitment and Alice's probability
of successfully unveiling whatever bit she desires. In this paper, we seek to
determine these bounds for generalizations of the BB84 bit commitment protocol.
In such protocols, an honest Alice commits to a bit by randomly choosing a
state from a specified set and submitting this to Bob, and later unveils the
bit to Bob by announcing the chosen state, at which point Bob measures the
projector onto the state. Bob's optimal cheating strategy can be easily deduced
from well known results in the theory of quantum state estimation. We show how
to understand Alice's most general cheating strategy, (which involves her
submitting to Bob one half of an entangled state) in terms of a theorem of
Hughston, Jozsa and Wootters. We also show how the problem of optimizing
Alice's cheating strategy for a fixed submitted state can be mapped onto a
problem of state estimation. Finally, using the Bloch ball representation of
qubit states, we identify the optimal coherent attack for a class of protocols
that can be implemented with just a single qubit. These results provide a tight
upper bound on Alice's probability of successfully unveiling whatever bit she
desires in the protocol proposed by Aharonov et al., and lead us to identify a
qubit protocol with even greater security.

the absence of hidden variables but to the impossibility for standard quantum

macroscopic phenomena [J.R. Friedman et al.,Nature, 406 (2000) 43]. To face the
challenge of this new fact, in this article QM in its standard form is assumed
to be extended by one beable (hidden variable), i. e., a quantum observable
with always definite values in nature (but usually only statistically given in
the quantum state). Localization is taken as the most plausible beable. The
paradoxical aspects of conventional QM take now a different form. Suitably
defining the notion of &quot;subject&quot; fully within the QM formalism, proving the
quantum conditional subsystem-state theorem, and choosing the
relative-decoherence interpretation of QM, the paradoxes formally disappear,
leaving one with decoherence relative to the definite values of the beable;
thus being only appearance, not absolute reality in QM. Relative to a different
subject one has perseverance of coherence. Hence, in this approach it is
claimed that decoherence and coherence, both exist in reality, but are not
&quot;seen&quot; by the same subject, and &quot;subject&quot; is, in this interpretation,
indispensable. The two mentioned, apparently contradictory phenomena, are in
this way decoupled from each other, contradiction is avoided, and any one of
the two can be treated in the way that is usual in QM.

a crisp limit of a &quot;fuzzy&quot; quantum mechanics. Based on these considerations it
is possible to arrive at the Schroedinger equation directly from the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The link between these equations is based on the fact
that a unique (&quot;crisp&quot;) trajectory of a classical particle emerges out of a
continuum of possible paths collapsing to a single trajectory according to the
principle of least action. This can be interpreted as a consequence of an
assumption that a quantum &quot;particle&quot; &quot;resides&quot; in every path of the continuum
of paths which collapse to a single(unique) trajectory of an observed classical
motion. A wave function then is treated as a function describing a
deterministic entity having a fuzzy character. As a consequence of such an
interpretation, the complimentarity principle and wave-particle duality can be
abandoned in favor of a fuzzy deterministic microoobject.

  Relative-Collapse Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics as Compared to the
  Conventional One</title><description>  Analyzing two standard preparators, the Stern-Gerlach and the
hole-in-the-screen ones, it is demonstrated that four entities are the basic
ingredients of the theory: the composite-system preparator-plus-object state
(coming about as a result of a suitable interaction between the subsystems), a
suitable preparator observable, one of its characteristic projectors called the
triggering event, and, finally, the conditional object state corresponding to
the occurrence of the triggering event. The concepts of a conditional state and
of retrospective apparent ideal occurrence are discussed in the conventional
interpretation of quantum mechanics. In the general theory of a preparator in
this interpretation first-kind and second-kind preparators are distinguished.
They are described by the same entities in the same way, but in terms of
different physical mechanisms. In this article the relative-collapse
interpretation is extended to encompass also preparators (besides measuring
apparatuses). In this interpretation also the mechanisms become the same and
one has only one kind of preparators.

We develop an algebraic formalism based on symmetry which gives information on

  In an attempt to close this loophole, we review two sufficient conditions

We

conjugate variables such as position and momentum or the two quadrature
components of a light mode. The resulting cloning fidelity for coherent states,
namely $F=2/3$, is shown to be optimal. An asymmetric version of this Gaussian
cloner is then used to assess the security of a continuous-variable quantum key
distribution scheme that allows two remote parties to share a Gaussian key. The
information versus disturbance tradeoff underlying this continuous quantum
cryptographic scheme is then analyzed for the optimal individual attack.
Methods to convert the resulting Gaussian keys into secret key bits are also
studied. The extension of the Gaussian cloner to optimal $N$-to-$M$ continuous
cloners is then discussed, and it is shown how to implement these cloners for
light modes, using a phase-insensitive optical amplifier and beam splitters.
Finally, a phase-conjugated inputs $(N,N')$-to-$(M,M')$ continuous cloner is
defined, yielding $M$ clones and $M'$ anticlones from $N$ replicas of a
coherent state and $N'$ replicas of its phase-conjugate (with $M'-M=N'-N$).
This novel kind of cloners is shown to outperform the standard $N$-to-$M$
cloners in some situations.

teleportation is analogous to the one-time-pad, the concept of ``pure state''

essentially classical secrecy protocols, and single copy entanglement
manipulations have such a close classical analog that the majorization results
are reproduced in the classical setting. This analogy allows one to import
questions from the quantum domain into the classical one, and vice-versa,
helping to get a better understanding of both. Also, by identifying classical

absorption profile of a three (or multi-) level system which is tailored by a
quantum interference. With cooling rates comparable to conventional sideband
cooling, lower final temperatures may be achieved. The method was
experimentally implemented to cool a single Ca$^+$ ion to its vibrational
ground state. Since a broad band of vibrational frequencies can be cooled
simultaneously, the technique will be particularly useful for the cooling of
larger ion strings, thereby being of great practical importance for
initializing a quantum register based on trapped ions. We also discuss its

be performed using linear optical elements, additional photons (ancilla), and
post-selection based on the output of single-photon detectors. Here we describe
the operation of several quantum logic operations of an elementary nature,
including a quantum parity check and a quantum encoder, and we show how they
can be combined to implement a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. All of these gates
can be constructed using polarizing beam splitters that completely transmit one
state of polarization and totally reflect the orthogonal state of polarization,
which allows a simple explanation of each operation. We also describe a
polarizing beam splitter implementation of a CNOT gate that is closely
analogous to the quantum teleportation technique previously suggested by
Gottesman and Chuang [Nature 402, p.390 (1999)]. Finally, our approach has the
interesting feature that it makes practical use of a quantum-eraser technique.

that should be associated with the angular and translation momentum transfer to
matter from the photon absorbed. The effect is described in the approximation
of the single line without the conventional line mixing. A narrowing function
is introduced that links the absorption in the resonance region with the one in
far wings. This function enlarges the absorption of a single line approximately
in two times in the resonance region at high pressures and decreases the one
approximately in 20 times in far wings in comparison with the Lorentzian,
independently of the type of molecule and pressures. The halfwidth of a single

which does not require repeated spontaneous emission by each molecule. The
cooling works by repetition of three main steps: velocity selection of a narrow
momentum width, deceleration of velocity selected molecules and accumulation of
the decelerated molecules by an irreversible process, namely by single
spontaneous emission. We develop a cooling model which enables analytical
description of the transient populations and entropies for the total molecular
system, the center of mass degree of freedom and the internal degrees of
freedom. Simulation shows that the cooling process can reduce a large momentum
width to a final width which in principle can be arbitrarily small. Center of
mass entropy is reduced while the internal entropy is increased after cooling.
We show that translational cooling can occur during coherent laser
interactions. The entropies change in consistency with the Araki-Lieb
inequality.

Husimi Q-functions and their classical trajectory simulations are analysed to
reveal a special regime corresponding to the time-stable sub-Poissonian
photocount statistics of the sum-frequency mode. Conditions for observation of
this regime are discussed. Theoretical predictions of the Fano factor and
explanation of the extraordinary stabilization of the sub-Poissonian photocount

Scaling laws for the maximum sub-Poissonian behavior are found. Noise

up to a local change of basis, only two subsets exist that can be implemented
remotely with a non-trivial protocol: Arbitrary rotations around a fixed

direction lying in a plane orthogonal to $\vec{n}$. The overall classical
information and distributed entanglement cost required for the remote
implementation depends on whether it is a priori known to which of the two
teleportable subsets the transformation belongs to. If it is so, the optimal
protocol consumes one e-bit of entanglement and one c-bit in each direction. If
the subset is not known, two e-bits of entanglement need to be consumed while
the classical channel becomes asymmetric, two c-bits are conveyed from Alice to

d optical modes containing exactly one photon altogether. From recent results

states of two qudits for d&gt;2 - not even with the probability of success lower

However, it is shown that auxiliary photons can help to discriminate the Bell
states of qudits with the high probability of success: A Bell-state analyzer

assign a sieve as a partial and contextual truth value to a proposition that

we relate such sieve-valued valuations to valuations that assign to quantities
subsets, rather than single elements, of their spectra (we call these
`interval' valuations). There are two main results. First, there is a natural
correspondence between these two kinds of valuation, which uses the notion of a
state's support for a quantity (Section 3). Second, if one starts with a more
general notion of interval valuation, one sees that our interval valuations
based on the notion of support (and correspondingly, our sieve-valued
valuations) are a simple way to secure certain natural properties of
valuations, such as monotonicity (Section 4).

that obtained employing bulk crystals. Even if using low power laser diodes,
this engenders a significant probability for creating two pairs at a time - an
important advantage for some quantum communication protocols. We point out a
simple means to characterize the pair creation probability in case of a pulsed

people might have about one and the same physical system: their density
matrices must commute and must have a non-zero product. I describe a simple
counterexample to his first condition, but show that his second condition,

carried out to determine the magnitude of the fluctuations experienced by the

this result rigorously from the underlying stochastic dynamics for state
reduction in the case of both a pure and a mixed initial state. We also analyse
the associated Lindblad equation for the evolution of the density matrix, and
obtain an exact time-dependent solution for the state reduction that explicitly
exhibits the transition from a general initial density matrix to the L\&quot;uders

formulae for the dynamics of the state in terms of a family of geometric
Brownian motions, thereby constructing an explicit unravelling of the Lindblad

accurate study of the lowest gerade 1g and ungerade 1u electronic states of the
molecular ion $H_2^+$ in a magnetic field is performed. Magnetic field ranges
from 0 to 4.414x10^13 G and orientations of the molecular axis with respect to
the magnetic line 0 \leq theta \leq 90 are considered. A one-parameter gauge
dependent vector potential is used in the Hamiltonian, which is finally
variationally optimized. A well pronounced minimum on the total energy surface
of the (ppe) system in both 1g and 1u states is found for all magnetic fields
and orientations studied. It is shown that for both states the parallel
configuration (theta=0) at equilibrium always corresponds to the minimal total
energy. It is found that for a given theta for both states the magnetic field
growth is always accompanied by an increase in the total and binding energies
as well as a shrinking of the equilibrium distance. We demonstrate that for
B\gtrsim 1.8x10^11 G the molecular ion can dissociate, H2+ -&gt; H + p, over a
certain range of orientations (theta_cr \le theta \le 90), where the minimal
thetaa_cr \simeq 25 occurs for the strongest magnetic field studied,
B=4.414x10^13 G. For B&lt;10^12 G the ion H2+ in 1g, 1u states is the most
compact, being in the perpendicular configuration (theta=90), whereas for
B\gtrsim 10^12 this occurs for an angle &lt; 90. For the 1g state in any
orientation, with the magnetic field growth at B \sim 10^11 G, a two-peak
electronic distribution changes to single-peak one.

distance of an entangled state to the set of all partially transposed states.
We prove that this latter distance can be expressed as a function of the

how it is related to the distance of a state to the set of positive partially

biseparable state to the W-state, and give a simple and very general proof for
the fact that the set of W-type states is not of measure zero. Next we show
that all surfaces with states whose partial transposes have constant minimal
negative eigenvalue are similar to the boundary of PPT states. We illustrate
this with some examples on bipartite qubit states, where contours of constant

factoring large integers, simulating quantum systems, and database searching.
Using a photon as a quantum bit (qubit) is one of the most promising ways to
realize a universal quantum computer because the coherent superposition state
of a photon is very robust against various sources of decoherence. However, it
is too difficult to realize two-qubit (photon) gates because it requires huge
nonlinearity between photons. Here we show the realization of a controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gate, the most important and elemental two-qubit gate for quantum
computation, by extending our previous research. The heart of our experiment is
the conditional measurement of two-photon coincidences in the Franson-type
experiment[7]. The photon counting measurement plays the same role as the
nonlinearity required for the two-qubit gate, and our system reproduces the
truth table of the CNOT gate. Furthermore, we create an entangled state from
the superposition state by our gate, which is clear evidence that our gate
works as a quantum logic gate. Our results make it possible to manipulate the
quantum state of photons including entanglement and represent significant
progress in the operation of various algorithms in quantum computation.

Aristotelians caught in the crossfire. For the latter, quantum states are
neither states of Nature nor states of knowledge. The real issue is not the
kind of reality that we should attribute to quantum states but the reality of
the spatial and temporal distinctions that we make. Once this is recognized,
the necessity of attributing ontological primacy to facts becomes obvious, the

  versus Average Bound</title><description>  In order to be practically useful, quantum cryptography must not only provide
a guarantee of secrecy, but it must provide this guarantee with a useful,
sufficiently large throughput value. The standard result of generalized privacy
amplification yields an upper bound only on the average value of the mutual
information available to an eavesdropper. Unfortunately this result by itself
is inadequate for cryptographic applications. A naive application of the
standard result leads one to incorrectly conclude that an acceptable upper
bound on the mutual information has been achieved. It is the pointwise value of
the bound on the mutual information, associated with the use of some specific
hash function, that corresponds to actual implementations. We provide a fully
rigorous mathematical derivation that shows how to obtain a cryptographically
acceptable upper bound on the actual, pointwise value of the mutual
information. Unlike the bound on the average mutual information, the value of
the upper bound on the pointwise mutual information and the number of bits by
which the secret key is compressed are specified by two different parameters,
and the actual realization of the bound in the pointwise case is necessarily
associated with a specific failure probability. The constraints amongst these
parameters, and the effect of their values on the system throughput, have not
been previously analyzed. We show that the necessary shortening of the key
dictated by the cryptographically correct, pointwise bound, can still produce
viable throughput rates that will be useful in practice.

cloning. We call this measure the relative error because the one compares the
errors in the copies with contiguous size taking into account the similarity of
states to be copied. A copying transformation and dimension of state space are
not specified. Only the unitarity of quantum mechanical transformations is
used. The presented approach is based on the notion of the angle between two
states. Firstly, several useful statements simply expressed in terms of angles
are proved. Among them there are the spherical triangle inequality and the
inequality establishing the upper bound on the modulus of difference between
probability distributions generated by two any states for an arbitrary
measurement. The tightest lower bound on the relative error is then obtained.
Hillery and Buzek originally examined an approximate state-dependent copying
and obtained the lower bound on the absolute error. We consider relationship
between the size of error and the corresponding probability distributions and
obtain the tightest lower bound on the absolute error. Thus, the proposed
approach supplements and reinforces the results obtained by Hillery and Buzek.
Finally, the basic findings of investigation for the relative error are
discussed.

conventional time-dependent perturbation theory, the state vector must be
calculated before the experimentally-observable expectation values of relevant
operators can be computed. We discuss an alternative form of time-dependent
perturbation theory in which the observable expectation values are calculated
directly and expressed in the form of nested commutators. This result is
consistent with the fact that the commutation relations determine the
properties of a quantum system, while the commutators often have a form that
simplifies the calculation and avoids canceling terms. The usefulness of this
method is illustrated using several problems of interest in quantum optics and
quantum information processing.

which macroscopic patterns are both initiated and sustained by quantum noise.
Familiar methods based linearization about a pseudo-classical field fail in
this regime and new approaches are required. We employ a method in which the
pump field is treated as a $c$-number variable but is driven by the $c$-number
representation of the quantum sub-harmonic signal field. This allows us to
include the effects of the fluctuations in the signal on the pump, which in
turn act back on the signal. We find that the non-classical effects, in the

Further above threshold the macroscopic quantum noise suppresses these effects.

decomposition on a real parameterization of the density matrix. We show that
the Lorentz singular values are variationally defined and give rise to
entanglement monotones, with as a special case the concurrence. Next a
necessary and sufficient criterion is conjectured for a mixed state to be
convertible into another specific one with a non-zero probability. Finally the
formalism of the Lorentz singular value decomposition is applied to tripartite
pure states of qubits. New proofs are given for the existence of the GHZ- and
W-class of states, and a rigorous proof for the optimal distillation of a
GHZ-state is derived.

we study the concept of a scalable (approximate) programmable quantum gate
(SPQG). These are special (approximate) programmable quantum gates, with nice
properties that could have implications on the theory of universal computation.
Unfortunately, as we prove, such objects do not exist in the domain of usual
quantum theory. In the second part the problem of noisy dense coding (and
generalizations) is addressed. We observe that the additivity problem for the
classical capacity obtained is of apparently greater generality than for the
usual quantum channel (completely positive maps): i.e., the latter occurs as a
special case of the former, but, as we shall argue with the help of the
non-existence result of the first part, the former cannot be reduced to an

  classical communication</title><description>  Consider a set of $N$ systems and an arbitrary interaction Hamiltonian $H$
that couples them. We investigate the use of local operations and classical
communication (LOCC), together with the Hamiltonian $H$, to simulate a unitary
evolution of the $N$ systems according to some other Hamiltonian $H'$. First,
we show that the most general simulation using $H$ and LOCC can be also
achieved, with the same time efficiency, by just interspersing the evolution of
$H$ with local unitary manipulations of each system and a corresponding local
ancilla (in a so-called LU+anc protocol). Thus, the ability to make local
measurements and to communicate classical information does not help in
non--local Hamiltonian simulation. Second, we show that both for the case of
two $d$-level systems ($d&gt;2$), or for that of a setting with more than two
systems ($N&gt;2$), LU+anc protocols are more powerful than LU protocols.
Therefore local ancillas are a useful resource for non--local Hamiltonian
simulation. Third, we use results of majorization theory to explicitly solve
the problem of optimal simulation of two-qubit Hamiltonians using LU
(equivalently, LU+anc, LO or LOCC).

the difference in atoms between the two species. Finally, we show that errors

  formalism</title><description>  The interest in quantum-optical states confined in finite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces has recently been stimulated by the progress in quantum computing,
quantum-optical state preparation, and measurement techniques, in particular,
by the development of the discrete quantum-state tomography. In the first part
of our review we present two essentially different approaches to define
harmonic oscillator states in the finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. One of
them is related to the truncation scheme of Pegg, Phillips and Barnett [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 81, 1604 (1998)] -- the so-called quantum scissors device. The
second method corresponds to the truncation scheme of Leo\'nski and Tana\'s
[Phys. Rev. A 49, R20 (1994)]. We propose some new definitions of the states
related to these truncation schemes and find their explicit forms in the Fock
representation. We discuss finite-dimensional generalizations of coherent
states, phase coherent states, displaced number states, Schr\&quot;odinger cats, and
squeezed vacuum. We show some intriguing properties of the states with the help
of the discrete Wigner function.

quantum mechanics. They act unitarily on the quantum phase space and generate
$\hbar$-independent quantum canonical maps. It is shown that such maps act in
the noncommutative phase space as dictated by the classical covariance. A
crucial observation made is that under the classical covariance the local
quantum mechanical picture can become nonlocal in the Hilbert space. This
nonlocal picture is made equivalent by the Weyl map to a noncommutative picture
in the phase space formulation of the theory. The connection between the
entanglement and nonlocality of the representation is explored and specific
examples of the generation of entanglement are provided by using such concepts
as the generalized Bell states. That the results have direct application in
generating vacuum soliton configurations in the recently popular scalar field
theories of noncommutative coordinates is also demonstrated.

the unique nature of stationary states, it is shown that gravitational

eigenvectors of bipartite mixed states. They are nonlocal invariants ie.,
remaining invariant after local unitary transformations. The algebraic sets
have to be the sum of the linear subspaces if the mixed states are separable,
and thus we give a &quot;eigenvalue-free&quot; criterion of separability.Based on our
criterion, examples are given to illustrate that entangled mixed states which
are invariant under partial transposition or fufill entropy and disorder
criterion of separability can be constructed systematically.We reveal that a

develop a method to measure this part of quantum enatnglement.The results are

speaking, if the one-way function acts on n-bit strings then the overhead in
the reduction is by a factor of O(n/epsilon^2) in the classical case but only
by a factor of O(1/epsilon) in the quantum case, where 1/2 + epsilon is the
probability of predicting the hard-predicate. Moreover, we prove via a lower

cannot have overhead less than order n/epsilon^2.
  We also show that, using this reduction, a quantum bit commitment scheme that
is perfectly binding and computationally concealing can be obtained from any

squeezing, in which the variances of one or more Stokes parameters are smaller

and provides information in form of the choice of a measurement result from all
possible measurement results. If infinitely many (different) measurement
results would be possible, the choice of a measurement result could deliver an
infinite quantity of information. But the results of physical measurings (of
finite duration) never deliver an infinite quantity of information, they
describe past, finite reality. Therefore the set of all possible measurement
results a priori is finite. In the physical reality only a finite information
quantity can be processed within a finite time interval. For mathematical
models whose representation requires a processing of an infinite quantity of
information, for example irrational numbers, no (exact) equivalent exists in
the physical reality. So mathematical calculations, which have an equivalent in
physical reality, can include only rational (finitely many elementary)
combinations of rational numbers. Conclusions arise from this for the
foundations of mathematical physics.

the perfect correlation of two spatially-separated particles, instead of
nonlocality in the orthodox formulation of quantum mechanics. Therefore, one

This rotation can therefore be formulated as a product of three boosts. In
relativistic kinematics, it is a rotation in the Lorentz frame where the
particle is at rest. This rotation does not change its momentum, but it rotates
the direction of the spin. The Wigner rotation is not confined to relativistic
kinematics. It manifests itself in physical systems where the underlying
mathematics is the Lorentz group. It is by now widely known that this group is
the basic scientific language for quantum and classical optics. It is shown

the root of Planck's law of radiation can be traced back to finite modification
of the infinite vacuum energy induced by the periodic boundary condition in the
temporal direction. We give the explicit conversion from the Casimir force to
Planck's law of radiation, which shows the apparent correspondence between the
system bounded by parallel conducting plates and the thermodynamic system. The
temperature inversion symmetry and the duality relation in the thermodynamics
are also discussed. We conclude that the effective temperature characterized by
the spatial extension should no longer be regarded as genuine temperature.

constituents, can be represented and studied by different algebras of
observables or operators. For example, a fully polarized electronic system can
be investigated by means of the algebra generated by the usual fermionic
creation and annihilation operators, or by using the algebra of Pauli
(spin-1/2) operators. The correspondence between the two algebras is given by
the Jordan-Wigner isomorphism. As we previously noted similar one-to-one
mappings enable one to represent any physical system in a quantum computer. In
this paper we evolve and exploit this fundamental concept in quantum
information processing to simulate generic physical phenomena by quantum
networks. We give quantum circuits useful for the efficient evaluation of the
physical properties (e.g, spectrum of observables or relevant correlation
functions) of an arbitrary system with Hamiltonian $H$.

the nonrelativistic and relativistic cases. We also present a numerical

this case we also compute the next-to-leading order radiative correction, which
turns out to be proportional to $\lambda^{3/2}$.

  measurements is not influenced by test-mass quantization</title><description>  It is shown that photon shot noise and radiation-pressure back-action noise
are the sole forms of quantum noise in interferometric gravitational wave
detectors that operate near or below the standard quantum limit, if one filters
the interferometer output appropriately. No additional noise arises from the
test masses' initial quantum state or from reduction of the test-mass state due
to measurement of the interferometer output or from the uncertainty principle
associated with the test-mass state. Two features of interferometers are
central to these conclusions: (i) The interferometer output (the photon number
flux N(t) entering the final photodetector) commutes with itself at different
times in the Heisenberg Picture, [N(t), N(t')] = 0, and thus can be regarded as
classical. (ii) This number flux is linear in the test-mass initial position
and momentum operators x_o and p_o, and those operators influence the measured
photon flux N(t) in manners that can easily be removed by filtering -- e.g., in
most interferometers, by discarding data near the test masses' 1 Hz swinging
freqency. The test-mass operators x_o and p_o contained in the unfiltered
output N(t) make a nonzero contribution to the commutator [N(t), N(t')]. That
contribution is cancelled by a nonzero commutation of the photon shot noise and
radiation-pressure noise, which also are contained in N(t). This cancellation
of commutators is responsible for the fact that it is possible to derive an
interferometer's standard quantum limit from test-mass considerations, and
independently from photon-noise considerations. These conclusions are true for
a far wider class of measurements than just gravitational-wave interferometers.
To elucidate them, this paper presents a series of idealized thought
experiments that are free from the complexities of real measuring systems.

Bohm have changed their initial enigmatic meanings and acquired quite
reasonable outlines of real and measurable characteristics. The start viewpoint
was the following: All the phenomena, which we observe in the quantum world,
should reflect structural properties of the real space. Thus the scale 10^{-28}
cm at which three fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, weak, and strong)
intersect has been treated as the size of a building block of the space. The
appearance of a massive particle is associated with a local deformation of the
cellular space, i.e. deformation of a cell. The mechanics of a moving particle
that has been constructed is deterministic by its nature and shows that the
particle interacts with cells of the space creating elementary excitations
called &quot;inertons&quot;. The further study has disclosed that inertons are a
substructure of the matter waves which are described by the orthodox wave
\psi-function formalism. The concept has allowed resolving the spin problem.
The theory, or more exactly, the existence of inertons, has been verified
experimentally: in rarefied gases, inerton clouds of atoms' electrons interact
with a strong laser pulse; in a solid, atom's inertons induce an additional
harmonic potential that contributes to the interatomic interaction (metal
specimens and the KIO_3*HIO_3 crystal).

I_2 and relative phase phi = phi_2-phi_1 may be characterized by the 3
observables p = sqrt{I_1 I_2}, p cos\phi and -p sin\phi. They are, e.g. the
starting point for the semi-classical operational approach by Noh, Fougeres and
Mandel (NFM) to the old and notorious phase problem in quantum optics.
Following a recent group theoretical quantization of the symplectic space S =
{(phi in R mod 2pi, p &gt; 0)} in terms of irreducible unitary representations of
the group SO(1,2) the present paper applies those results to that controversial
problem of quantizing moduli and phases of complex numbers: The Poisson
brackets of the classical observables p cos\phi, -p sin\phi and p &gt; 0 form the
Lie algebra of the group SO(1,2). The corresponding self-adjoint generators
K_1, K_2 and K_3 of that group may be obtained from its irreducible unitary
representations. For the positive discrete series the modulus operator K_3 has
the spectrum {k+n, n = 0, 1,2,...; k &gt; 0}. Self-adjoint operators for cos phi
and sin phi can be defined as ((1/K_3)K_1 + K_1/K_3)/2 and -((1/K_3)K_2 +
K_2/K_3)/2 which have the theoretically desired properties for k &gt; or = 0.5.
The approach advocated here solves, e.g. the modulus-phase quantization problem
for the harmonic oscillator and appears to provide a full quantum theoretical
basis for the NFM-formalism.

First, we consider the production of entangled states of two-level systems. We
show that by adiabatically varying the well biases we may dynamically generate
maximally entangled states, starting from initially unentangled product states.
Entanglement degradation due to a common type of environmental influence is
then computed by solving a master equation. However, we also demonstrate that
entanglement production is unaffected if the system-environment coupling is of

we construct a different master equation that seamlessly merges error
protection/detection dynamics for quantum information with the environmental
couplings responsible for producing the errors in the first place. Adiabatic

without classical communication. Like variable length data compression,
arbitrary unknown states are concentrated into perfect Bell states and not
approximate Bell states and the number of Bell states obtained is equal to the

  Reduction Models</title><description>  We consider the energy-driven stochastic state vector reduction equation for
the density matrix, which for pure state density matrices can be written in two
equivalent forms. We use these forms to discuss the decoupling of the noise
terms for independent subsystems, and to construct ``environmental'' stochastic
density matrices whose time-independent expectations are the usual quantum
statistical distributions. We then consider a measurement apparatus weakly
coupled to an external environment, and show that in mean field (Hartree)
approximation the stochastic equation separates into independent equations for
the apparatus and environment, with the Hamiltonian for the apparatus augmented
by the environmental expectation of the interaction Hamiltonian. We use the
Hartree approximated equation to study a simple accretion model for the
interaction of the apparatus with its environment, as part of a more general
discussion of when the stochastic dynamics predicts state vector reduction, and
when it predicts the maintenance of coherence. We also discuss the magnitude of
decoherence effects acting during the reduction process. Our analysis supports
the suggestion that a measurement takes place when the different outcomes are
characterized by sufficiently distinct environmental interactions for the
reduction process to be rapidly driven to completion.

It is shown that there exist nine families of states corresponding to nine

classical information. In the MKC models measurements do not generally reveal
pre-existing classical information. Consequently, the Kochen-Specker theorem is
not nullified. We go on to prove a generalized version of the Kochen-Specker

by the work of Simon et al and Larsson (SBZL). However, there is a loophole in
SBZL's argument, which means that their result is invalid (operational
non-contextuality is not inconsistent with the empirical predictions of quantum
mechanics). Our treatment resolves this difficulty. We conclude by discussing
the question, whether the MKC models can reproduce the empirical predictions of

associated to the POVM and the source, in a model that can be viewed as the
asymptotic version of the convex decomposition of POVMs into extremal ones.
This result is applied to a similar separation therorem for quantum instruments

related subjects: we stress the difference between data and information (in
particular by pointing out that information typically is strictly less than
data), derive the Holevo bound from our main result, and look at its classical

extrinsic/intrinsic data separation with a known source, then compare with the

commitment is impossible due to quantum entanglement cheating, which is

no-cloning. In the second variant, the impossibility proof fails because
quantum entanglement purification of a mixed state does not render the protocol

success of a state transformation and, as density operator eigenvalues, the
degree of mixedness of the final state. We give a unified treatment of
pure-to-pure state transformations, covering both probabilistic and
deterministic cases. We then discuss the role of majorization in describing the
dynamics of mixing in quantum operations. The conditions for mixing enhancement
for all initial states are derived. We show that mixing is monotonically
decreasing for deterministic pure-to-pure transformations, and discuss the

1-epsilon equals the complexity max_mu D_epsilon^mu(f) of an optimal
deterministic algorithm for f that is correct on a fraction 1-epsilon of the

bounded-error complexity is a lower bound on the quantum analogues of max mu
D_epsilon^mu(f). We then prove that equality cannot be obtained for the

are two of the most important tasks a physicist faces. For the first purpose
one can use tomography, a method that after subjecting the system to a number
of experiments determines all independent elements of the density matrix. For
the second task, one can resort to spectroscopy, a set of techniques used to
determine the spectrum of eigenvalues of the evolution operator. In this
letter, we show that tomography and spectroscopy can be naturally interpreted
as dual forms of quantum computation. We show how to adapt the simplest case of
the well-known phase estimation quantum algorithm to perform both tasks, giving
it a natural interpretation as a simulated scattering experiment. We show how
this algorithm can be used to implement an interesting form of tomography by
performing a direct measurement of the Wigner function of a quantum system. We
present results of such measurements performed on a system of three qubits
using liquid state NMR quantum computation techniques in a sample of
trichloroethylene. Remarkable analogies with other experiments are discussed.

in harmonic generation processes within quantum, classical and semiclassical
approaches. First, we study the exact quantum evolution of the harmonic
generation by applying numerical methods including those of Hamiltonian
diagonalization and global characteristics. We show explicitly that the
harmonic generations can indeed serve as a source of nonclassical light. Then,
we demonstrate that the quasi-stationary sub-Poissonian light can be generated
in these quantum processes under conditions corresponding to the so-called
no-energy-transfer regime known in classical nonlinear optics. By applying
method of classical trajectories, we demonstrate that the analytical
predictions of the Fano factors are in good agreement with the quantum results.
On comparing second and higher harmonic generations in the no-energy-transfer

generation with the Fano-factor of the third harmonic equal to 13/16.

systems subjected to finitely many interactions with classical apparatuses. The
systems in question may be composed of distinct, spatially separated subsystems
which evolve independently but may also interact. This evolution, driven both
by unitary operators and measurements, is coded in a precise mathematical
structure in such a way that the crucial properties of causality, covariance
and entanglement are faithfully represented. We show how our framework may be
expressed using the language of (poly)categories and functors. Remarkably,
important physical consequences - such as covariance - follow directly from the
functoriality of our axioms.
  We establish strong links between the physical picture we propose and linear
logic. Specifically we show that the refined logical connectives of linear
logic can be used to describe the entanglements of subsystems in a precise way.
Furthermore, we show that there is a precise correspondence between the
evolution of a given system and deductions in a certain formal logical system
based on the rules of linear logic.
  This framework generalizes and enriches both causal posets and the histories
approach to quantum mechanics.

algorithms, both on a line and on a circle. It has been found that the quantum
versions have markedly different features to the classical versions. Namely,
the variance on the line, and the mixing time on the circle increase
quadratically faster in the quantum versions as compared to the classical
versions. Here, we propose a scheme to implement the quantum random walk on a
line and on a circle in an ion trap quantum computer. With current ion trap
technology, the number of steps that could be experimentally implemented will
be relatively small. However, we show how the enhanced features of these walks
could be observed experimentally. In the limit of strong decoherence, the
quantum random walk tends to the classical random walk. By measuring the degree
to which the walk remains `quantum', this algorithm could serve as an important
benchmarking protocol for ion trap quantum computers.

leads to a mapping from qubits to parafermions: particles with a hybrid
boson-fermion quantum statistics. We study this mapping in detail, and use it
to provide a classification of the algebras of operators acting on qubits.
These algebras in turn classify the universality of different classes of
physically relevant qubit-qubit interaction Hamiltonians. The mapping is
further used to elucidate the connections between qubits, bosons, and fermions.
These connections allow us to share universality results between the different
particle types. Finally, we use the mapping to study the quantum computational
power of certain anisotropic exchange Hamiltonians. In particular, we prove
that the XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions only is not
computationally universal. We also generalize previous results about universal
quantum computation with encoded qubits to codes with higher rates.

in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics: whether it is an extensive
quantity or not, how it changes when identical particles are mixed, and the
proper way to count states in systems of identical particles. Several authors
have recognized that the paradox is resolved once it is realized that there is
no such thing as the entropy of a system, that there are many entropies, and
that the choice between treating particles as being distinguishable or not
depends on the resolution of the experiment. The purpose of this note is
essentially pedagogical; we add to their analysis by examining the paradox from
the point of view of information theory. Our argument is based on that
`grouping' property of entropy that Shannon recognized, by including it among
his axioms, as an essential requirement on any measure of information. Not only
does it provide the right connection between different entropies but, in
addition, it draws our attention to the obvious fact that addressing issues of
distinguishability and of counting states requires a clear idea about what
precisely do we mean by a state.

in quantum states and a general circuit to retrieve them with definite success
probability. The continuous variable of the operator is stored in a
single-qubit state and the information about the kind of the operator is stored
in classical states with finite dimension. The probability of successful
retrieval is always 1/2 irrespective of the kind of the operator, which is
proved to be maximum. In case of failure, the result can be corrected with
additional quantum states. The retrieving circuit is almost as simple as that
which handles only the single-qubit rotations and CNOT as the basic operations.
An interactive way to transfer quantum dynamics, that is, to distribute
naturally copy-protected programs for quantum computers is also presented using
this scheme.

generalized quantum measurement with outcomes in a measurable space. Analyzing
the unitary invariants of a measuring process, we present the most general form
of a possible integral representation of an instrument, which differs from the
representations of an instrument available in the mathematical and physical
literature. We introduce the notion of a quantum stochastic representation of
an instrument, whose elements are wholly determined by the unitary invariants
of a measuring process. We show that the description of a generalized direct
quantum measurement can be considered in the frame of a new general approach,
which we call the quantum stochastic approach (QSA), based on the notion of a
family of quantum stochastic evolution operators, satisfying the orthonormality
relation and describing the conditional evolution of a quantum system under a
measurement. The QSA allows to give: a) the complete statistical description of
any generalized direct quantum measurement (a POV measure and a family of
posterior states); b) the complete description in a Hilbert space of the
stochastic behaviour of a quantum system under a measurement in the sense of
specification of the probabilistic transition law governing the change from the
initial state of a quantum system to a final one under a single measurement; c)
to formalize the consideration of all possible types of quantum measurements.
For measurements continuous in time the QSA allows, in particular, to define in
the most general case (without assuming any Markov property) the notion of
posterior pure state trajectories (quantum trajectories) and to give their
probabilistic treatment.

  fermions</title><description>  We solve the $S=1/2$ Kondo lattice model within the dynamical mean field
theory. Detailed predictions are made for the dependence of the lattice Kondo
resonance and the conduction electron spectral density on temperature and band
filling $n_{c}$. Two low-energy scales are identified in the spectra: a
renormalized hybridization pseudogap scale $T^{*}$, which correlates with the
single-ion Kondo scale, and a lattice Kondo scale $T_{0} &lt; T^{*}$, which acts
as the Fermi-liquid coherence scale. The lattice Kondo resonance is split into
a main branch, which is pinned at the Fermi level, and whose width is set by
$T_{0}$, and an upper branch at $\omega\approx T^{*}$. The weight of the upper
branch decreases rapidly away from $n_{c}=1$ and vanishes for $n_{c}\lesssim
0.7$. In contrast, the pseudogap in the conduction electron spectral density
persists for all $n_{c}$. On increasing temperature, the lattice Kondo
resonance at the Fermi level vanishes on a temperature scale of order $10
T_{0}$, as in impurity model calculations. In contrast to impurity model
spectra, however, the position of the lattice Kondo resonance depends strongly
on temperature, particularly close to the Kondo insulating state. The results
are used to make predictions on the temperature dependence of the low-energy
photoemission and inverse photoemission spectra of metallic heavy fermions and
doped Kondo insulators. We compare our results with available high-resolution
measurements on YbInCu$_4$ and YbAgCu$_4$. The loss in intensity with
increasing temperature, and the asymmetric lineshape of the low-energy spectra
are well accounted for by our model. More detailed agreement with experiment
would require including the $f$-orbital degeneracy and crystal-field excited
states.

detector based on the radio-frequency single-electron transistor (rf-SET).
Using the noise analysis of a SET by Korotkov as our starting point, we
determine the spectral density of the displacement noise due to the tunneling
current shot noise. The resulting mechanical displacement noise decreases in
inverse proportion to the increasing gate voltage. In contrast, the
displacement noise due to the fluctuating SET island charge increases
approximately linearly with increasing gate voltage. Taking into account both
of these noise sources results in an optimum gate voltage value for the lowest
displacement noise and hence best sensitivity. We show that a displacement
sensitivity of about 10^-4 Angstroms and a force sensitivity of about 10^-16 N
are predicted for a micron-sized cantilever with a realizable resonant
frequency 100 MHz and quality factor Q~10^4. Such sensitivities would allow the
detection of quantum squeezing in the mechanical motion of the micro-mechanical

polarization induced quantum wire (NSPI QW) is theoretically studied. In the

hyperfine field which confines the electrons with the spins opposite to the
hyperfine field to the regions of maximal nuclear spin polarization. The
influence of the nuclear spin relaxation and diffusion on the electron energy
spectrum and on the conductance of the quantum wire is calculated and the

possibilities in only sqrt(N) steps. This paper gives a fresh perspective on
the algorithm in terms of a resonance phenomenon which is implemented through
classical coupled oscillators. Consider N oscillators, one of which is of a
different resonant frequency. We could identify which one this is by measuring
the oscillation frequency of each oscillator, a procedure that would take about
N cycles. We show how, by coupling the oscillators together in a very simple
way, it is possible to identify the different one in only sqrt(N) cycles. An
extension of this technique to the quantum case leads to the quantum search
algorithm.

we investigate in what sense entanglement change and interactions imply each

shown to represent a non-conserved property for any bi-partite system and any
type of interaction. This general relation does not exclude the existence of
special initial product states, for which the entanglement remains small over
some period of time, despite interactions. For this case we derive an
approximation to the full Schroedinger equation, which allows the treatment of
the composite systems in terms of product states. The induced error is
estimated. In this factorization-approximation one subsystem appears as an
effective potential for the other. A pertinent example is the Jaynes-Cummings
model, which then reduces to the semi-classical rotating wave approximation.

classes of switched electrical networks, typically used in converting power in
a dc-dc converter. This procedure makes use of decompositions of SU(2) to
obtain controls that are piecewise constant and can be constrained to be
bang-bang with values 0 or 1. Complete results are presented for a third order
network first. An example, which shows that the basic strategy is viable for
fourth order circuits, is also given. The former evolves on SO(3), while the
latter evolves on SO(4). Since the former group is intimately related to SU(2)
while the latter is related to SU(2)xSU(2), the methodology of this paper uses
factorizations of SU(2). The systems in this paper are single input systems
with drift. In this paper, no approximations or other artifices are used to
remove the drift. Instead, the drift is important in the determination of the
controls. Periodicity arguments are rarely used.

formulation is presented for performing decoherence-free (DF) quantum computing
in Rigged Liouville Space (RLS). Three types of interactions were considered,
and in each case, stationary and evolutionary states were evaluated for DF
behavior in both the total space and the projected subspace. Projected
subspaces were found using the subdynamics kinetic equation. It was shown that
although the total space may be decoherent, the subspace can be DF. In the
projected subspace, the evolution of the density operator may be time
asymmetric. Hence, a formulation for performing quantum computing in RLS or
rigged Hilbert space (RHS) was proposed, and a quantum Controlled-Not Logical
gate with corresponding operations in RLS (RHS) was constructed. A generalized
quantum Turing machine in RHS was also discussed. Key Words: Quantum Computing,

spectrum is demonstrated within the example of the square barrier potential.
The non-square integrable solutions of the time-independent Schrodinger
equation are used to define Dirac kets, which are (generalized) eigenvectors of
the Hamiltonian. These Dirac kets are antilinear functionals over the space of
physical wave functions. They are also basis vectors that expand any physical
wave function in a Dirac basis vector expansion. It is shown that an acceptable
physical wave function must fulfill stronger conditions than just square
integrability--the space of physical wave functions is not the whole Hilbert
space but rather a dense subspace of the Hilbert space. We construct the
position and energy representations of the Rigged Hilbert Space generated by
the square barrier potential Hamiltonian. We shall also construct the unitary
operator that transforms from the position into the energy representation. We
shall see that in the energy representation the Dirac kets act as the
antilinear Schwartz delta functional. In constructing the Rigged Hilbert Space
of the square barrier potential, we will find a systematic procedure to
construct the Rigged Hilbert Space of a large class of spherically symmetric
potentials. The example of the square barrier potential will also make apparent
that the natural framework for the solutions of a Schrodinger operator with
continuous spectrum is the Rigged Hilbert Space rather than just the Hilbert
space.

realisable operations that realise as closely as possible certain desired
transformations between quantum states, e.g. quantum cloning, teleportation,
quantum gates, etc. Mathematically, this problem boils down to finding a
completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) linear map that maximizes the
(mean) fidelity between the map itself and the desired transformation. In this
note we want to draw attention to the fact that this problem belongs to the
class of so-called semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. As SDP problems are
convex, it immediately follows that they do not suffer from local optima.
Furthermore, this implies that the numerical optimization of the CPTP map can,
and should, be done using methods from the well-established SDP field, as these
methods exploit convexity and are guaranteed to converge to the real solution.
Finally, we show how the duality inherent to convex and SDP problems can be
exploited to prove analytically the optimality of a proposed solution. We give
an example of how to apply this proof method by proving the optimality of Hardy
and Song's proposed solution for the universal qubit $\theta$-shifter
(quant-ph/0102100).

  Uncertainty Relation</title><description>  Suppose that the Hamiltonian acting on a quantum system is unknown and one
wants to determine what is the Hamiltonian. We show that in general this
requires a time $\Delta t$ which obeys the uncertainty relation $\Delta t
\Delta H \gtrsim 1$ where $\Delta H$ is a measure of how accurately the unknown
Hamiltonian must be estimated. We then apply this result to the problem of
measuring the energy of an unknown quantum state. It has been previously shown
that if the Hamiltonian is known, then the energy can in principle be measured
in an arbitrarily short time. On the other hand we show that if the Hamiltonian
is not known then an energy measurement necessarily takes a minimum time
$\Delta t$ which obeys the uncertainty relation $\Delta t \Delta E \gtrsim 1$
where $\Delta E$ is the precision of the energy measurement. Several examples
are studied to address the question of whether it is possible to saturate these
uncertainty relations. Their interpretation is discussed in detail.

  Certificates</title><description>  The class MA consists of languages that can be efficiently verified by
classical probabilistic verifiers using a single classical certificate, and the
class QMA consists of languages that can be efficiently verified by quantum
verifiers using a single quantum certificate. Suppose that a verifier receives
not only one but multiple certificates. In the classical setting, it is obvious
that a classical verifier with multiple classical certificates is essentially
the same with the one with a single classical certificate. However, in the
quantum setting where a quantum verifier is given a set of quantum certificates
in tensor product form (i.e. each quantum certificate is not entangled with
others), the situation is different, because the quantum verifier might utilize
the structure of the tensor product form. This suggests a possibility of
another hierarchy of complexity classes, namely the QMA hierarchy. From this
point of view, we extend the definition of QMA to QMA(k) for the case quantum
verifiers use k quantum certificates, and analyze the properties of QMA(k).
  To compare the power of QMA(2) with that of QMA(1) = QMA, we show one
interesting property of ``quantum indistinguishability''. This gives a strong
evidence that QMA(2) is more powerful than QMA(1). Furthermore, we show that,
for any fixed positive integer $k \geq 2$, if a language L has a one-sided
bounded error QMA(k) protocol with a quantum verifier using k quantum
certificates, L necessarily has a one-sided bounded error QMA(2) protocol with
a quantum verifier using only two quantum certificates.

canonical quantum general relativity, sometimes called &quot;loop quantum gravity&quot;.
The term &quot;modern&quot; in the title refers to the fact that the quantum theory is
based on formulating classical general relativity as a theory of connections
rather than metrics as compared to in original version due to Arnowitt, Deser
and Misner. Canonical quantum general relativity is an attempt to define a
mathematically rigorous, non-perturbative, background independent theory of
Lorentzian quantum gravity in four spacetime dimensions in the continuum. The
approach is minimal in that one simply analyzes the logical consequences of
combining the principles of general relativity with the principles of quantum
mechanics. The requirement to preserve background independence has lead to new,
fascinating mathematical structures which one does not see in perturbative
approaches, e.g. a fundamental discreteness of spacetime seems to be a
prediction of the theory providing a first substantial evidence for a theory in
which the gravitational field acts as a natural UV cut-off. An effort has been
made to provide a self-contained exposition of a restricted amount of material
at the appropriate level of rigour which at the same time is accessible to
graduate students with only basic knowledge of general relativity and quantum
field theory on Minkowski space.

transmission performance than the direct transmission channel in a certain

entanglement of a mixed state (as a source)at expense of the entanglement of
others(as an ancilla)by collective measurement. A protocol with which one can
get a pure entangled state from a mixed state is defined as purifying mixed
states. We address a basic question: can one get a pure entangled state from a
mixed state? We give a necessary and sufficient condition of purifying a mixed

class of source states and ancilla states in arbitrary bipartite systems
purifying mixed states is impossible by finite rounds of purifying protocols.
For $2\otimes 2$ systems, it is proved that arbitrary states cannot be purified

  Solving these difficulties leads us to propose a new classical canonical

distribution. At mid revival time the field is almost in the pure state.
 We have briefly discussed the evolution of the Q function of the cavity field.
The connection between the field entropy and the collapses and revivals of the
atomic inversion has been established. We find that the phase probability
distribution of the field reflect the collapses and revivals of the level
occupation probabilities in most situations. The interaction brings about the
symmetrical splitting of the phase probability distribution. The general
conclusions reached are illustrated by numerical results.

trap embeded in the gravitational field of a spherically symmetric mass. One of
the ideas behind this work concerns the analysis of the effects that the
gravity--induced quantum noise, stemming from the bodies in the neighborhood of
the Paul trap, could have upon the enhancement of the quantum behavior of this
system. This will be done considering a series expansion for the gravitational
field of the source, and including in the Hamiltonian of the Paul trap only the
first two terms. Higher--order contributions will be introduced as part of the
environment of the system, and in consequence will not appear in the
Hamiltonian. In other words, we put forward an argument that allows us to
differentiate those gravitational degrees of freedom that will appear as an
uncontrollable influence on the Paul trap. Along the ideas of the so called
restricted path integral formalism, we take into account the continuous
monitoring of the position of our particle, and in consequence the
corresponding propagators and probabilities, associated with the different
measurements outputs, are obtained.
 Afterwards, the differential equation related to a quantum nondemolition
variable is posed and solved, i.e., a family of quantum nondemolition
parameters is obtained. Finally, a qualitative analysis of the effects on the
system, of the gravity--induced environment, will be done.

  propagation of coherent-product states</title><description>  The self-consistent propagation of generalized $D_{1}$ [coherent-product]
states and of a class of gaussian density matrix generalizations is examined,
at both zero and finite-temperature, for arbitrary interactions between the
localized lattice (electronic or vibronic) excitations and the phonon modes. It
is shown that in all legitimate cases, the evolution of $D_{1}$ states reduces
to the disentangled evolution of the component $D_{2}$ states. The
self-consistency conditions for the latter amount to conditions for
decoherence-free propagation, which complement the $D_{2}$ Davydov soliton
equations in such a way as to lift the nonlinearity of the evolution for the
on-site degrees of freedom. Although it cannot support Davydov solitons, the
coherent-product ansatz does provide a wide class of exact density-matrix
solutions for the joint evolution of the lattice and phonon bath in compatible
systems. Included are solutions for initial states given as a product of a
[largely arbitrary] lattice state and a thermal equilibrium state of the
phonons. It is also shown that external pumping can produce self-consistent
Frohlich-like effects. A few sample cases of coherent, albeit not solitonic,

using a perturbative method. We assume that each two-state system (qubit)
suffers \sigma_{z} error with probability p (0\leq p\leq 1) independently at
every step in the algorithm. Considering an n-qubit density operator to which
Grover's operation is applied M times, we expand it in powers of 2Mnp and
derive its matrix element order by order under the n\to \infty limit. (In this
large n limit, we assume p is small enough, so that 2Mnp(\geq 0) can take any
real positive value or 0.) This approach gives us an interpretation about
creation of new modes caused by \sigma_{z} error and an asymptotic form of an
arbitrary order correction. Calculating the matrix element up to the fifth
order term numerically, we investigate a region of 2Mnp (perturbative
parameter) where the algorithm finds the correct item with a threshold of
probability P_{th} or more. It satisfies 2Mnp&lt;(8/5)(1-P_{th}) around 2Mnp\simeq
0 and P_{th}\simeq 1, and this linear relation is applied to a wide range of
P_{th} approximately. This observation is similar to a result obtained by E.
Bernstein and U. Vazirani concerning accuracy of quantum gates for general
algorithms. We cannot investigate a quantum to classical phase transition of
the algorithm, because it is outside the reliable domain of our perturbation
theory.

from quantising a classical system. Also, a given quantum model may possess
more than just one classical limit. These facts find strong evidence in string
duality and M-theory, and it has been suggested that they should also have a
counterpart in quantum mechanics. In view of these developments we propose
&quot;dequantisation&quot;, a mechanism to render a quantum theory classical.
Specifically, we present a geometric procedure to &quot;dequantise&quot; a given quantum
mechanics (regardless of its classical origin, if any) to possibly different
classical limits, whose quantisation gives back the original quantum theory.
The standard classical limit $\hbar\to 0$ arises as a particular case of our
approach.

in the famous paper of Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen [18]. Recently it has been
realized that quantum entanglement is a key ingredient in quantum computation,
quantum communication and quantum cryptography ([16],[17],[6]). In this paper,
we introduce algebraic sets, which are determinantal varieties in the complex
projective spaces or the products of complex projective spaces, for the mixed
states in bipartite or multipartite quantum systems as their invariants under
local unitary transformations. These invariants are naturally arised from the
physical consideration of measuring mixed states by separable pure states. In
this way algebraic geometry and complex differential geometry of these
algebraic sets turn to be powerful tools for the understanding of quantum
enatanglement. Our construction has applications in the following important
topics in quantum information theory: 1) separability criterion, it is proved
the algebraic sets have to be the sum of the linear subspaces if the mixed
states are separable; 2) lower bound of Schmidt numbers, that is, generic low
rank bipartite mixed states are entangled in many degrees of freedom; 3)
simulation of Hamiltonians, it is proved the simulation of semi-positive
Hamiltonians of the same rank implies the projective isomorphisms of the
corresponding algebraic sets; 4) construction of bound enatanglement, examples
of the entangled mixed states which are invariant under partial transpositions
(thus PPT bound entanglement) are constructed systematically from our new
separability criterion. On the other hand many examples of entangled mixed
states with rich algebraic-geometric structure in their associated
determinantal varieties are constructed and studied from this point of view.

mesoscopic hybrid ring at equilibrium. The hybrid system is described by a ring
with bubble which is in turn coupled to a reservoir. In the system the ring
encloses a magnetic flux $\Phi$ while the bubble does not enclose any flux. The
novelty of this work lies in the fact that while earlier current enhancement
was observed in non-equilibrium systems (e.g., a ring coupled to two reservoirs
at different chemical potentials $\mu_{1}$ and $\mu_{2}$), herein we prove that
current enhancement can also arise in equilibrium. In addition, we show that
the closed system analog of our chosen open hybrid ring system violates parity

proven which serves as the most general basis for the second law, namely the
Thomson formulation (`cyclic changes cost energy'), applied to equilibrium.
This formulation of the second law is a property akin to particle conservation
(normalization of the wavefunction). It has been stricktly proven for a
canonical ensemble, and made plausible for a micro-canonical ensemble.
  As the derivation does not assume time-inversion-invariance, it is applicable
to situations where persistent current occur. This clear-cut derivation allows
to revive the ``no perpetuum mobile in equilibrium'' formulation of the second
law and to criticize some assumptions which are widespread in literature.
  The result puts recent results devoted to foundations and limitations of the
second law in proper perspective, and structurizes this relatively new field of

We assume that Bob knows the source statistics, and that Alice and Bob have

arbitrary finite dimensions. The central idea is that entanglement gives rise
to correlations between the particles that do not occur in separable states. We
individuate the contributions of these correlations to the joint and the
conditional probabilities of local measurements outcomes. We use these
probabilities to define the measure of entanglement. Our measure turns out to
be proportional to the so-called 2-entropy and therefore satisfies the
properties required for any measure of entanglement. We conclude with an
outlook on the problem of extending our approach to the case of multipartite

introduced by Kitaev. In these codes, qubits are arranged in a two-dimensional
array on a surface of nontrivial topology, and encoded quantum operations are
associated with nontrivial homology cycles of the surface. We formulate
protocols for error recovery, and study the efficacy of these protocols. An
order-disorder phase transition occurs in this system at a nonzero critical
value of the error rate; if the error rate is below the critical value (the
accuracy threshold), encoded information can be protected arbitrarily well in
the limit of a large code block. This phase transition can be accurately
modeled by a three-dimensional Z_2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder.
We estimate the accuracy threshold, assuming that all quantum gates are local,
that qubits can be measured rapidly, and that polynomial-size classical
computations can be executed instantaneously. We also devise a robust recovery
procedure that does not require measurement or fast classical processing;
however for this procedure the quantum gates are local only if the qubits are
arranged in four or more spatial dimensions. We discuss procedures for
encoding, measurement, and performing fault-tolerant universal quantum
computation with surface codes, and argue that these codes provide a promising
framework for quantum computing architectures.

the failure of local realism to deal with quantum reality. However, finite
statistics and the time sequential nature of real experiments still allow a
loophole for local realism, known as the memory loophole. We show that the
randomized design of the Aspect experiment closes this loophole. Our main tool
is van de Geer's (2000) supermartingale version of the classical Bernstein
(1924) inequality guaranteeing, at the root n scale, a
not-heavier-than-Gaussian tail of the distribution of a sum of bounded
supermartingale differences. The results are used to specify a protocol for a
public bet between the author and L. Accardi, who in recent papers (Accardi and
Regoli, 2000a,b, 2001; Accardi, Imafuku and Regoli, 2002) has claimed to have
produced a suite of computer programmes, to be run on a network of computers,
which will simulate a violation of Bell's inequalites. At a sample size of
thirty thousand, both error probabilities are guaranteed smaller than one in a
million, provided we adhere to the sequential randomized design. The results
also show that Hess and Philipp's (2001a,b) recent claims are mistaken that
Bell's theorem fails because of time phenomena supposedly neglected by Bell.

only to the extent that the associated basis problem is solved. The core basis
problem is that the robust enduring states specified by environmental
decoherence effects are essentially Gaussian wave packets that form continua of
non-orthogonal states. Hence they are not a discrete set of orthogonal basis
states to which finite probabilities can be assigned by the usual rules. The
natural way to get an orthogonal basis without going outside the Schroedinger
dynamics is to use the eigenstates of the reduced density matrix, and this idea
is the basis of some recent attempts by many-worlds proponents to solve the
basis problem. But these eigenstates do not enjoy the locality and
quasi-classicality properties of the states defined by environmental
decoherence effects, and hence are not satisfactory preferred basis states. The
basis problem needs to be addressed and resolved before a many-worlds-type
interpretation can be said to exist.

virtual particle to be absorbed and emitted by its matter. As described in the
vacuum universe model, the adjacent vacuum is derived from the pre-inflationary
universe in which the pre-adjacent vacuum is absorbed by the pre-matter. This
absorbed pre-adjacent vacuum is emitted to become the added space for the
inflation in the inflationary universe whose space-time is separated from the
pre-inflationary universe. This added space is the adjacent vacuum. The
absorption of the adjacent vacuum as the added space results in the adjacent
zero space (no space), Quantum mechanics is the interaction between matter and
the three different types of vacuum: the adjacent vacuum, the adjacent zero
space, and the empty space. The absorption of the adjacent vacuum results in
the empty space superimposed with the adjacent zero space, confining the matter
in the form of particle. When the absorbed vacuum is emitted, the adjacent
vacuum can be anywhere instantly in the empty space superimposed with the
adjacent zero space where any point can be the starting point (zero point) of
space-time. Consequently, the matter that expands into the adjacent vacuum has
the probability to be anywhere instantly in the form of wavefunction. In the
vacuum universe model, the universe not only gains its existence from the
vacuum but also fattens itself with the vacuum. During the inflation, the
adjacent vacuum also generates the periodic table of elementary particles to
account for all elementary particles and their masses in a good agreement with
the observed values.

neighbourhood of the state $\xi$ irrespective of the initial states of the
system and the reservoir qubits. This means that the system qubit undergoes an
evolution that has a fixed point, which is the reservoir state $\xi$. We also
study approximate homogenization when the reservoir is composed of a finite set
of identically prepared qubits. The homogenizer allows us to understand various
aspects of the dynamics of open systems interacting with environments in
non-equilibrium states. In particular, the reversibility vs or irreversibility
of the dynamics of the open system is directly linked to specific (classical)
information about the order in which the reservoir qubits interacted with the
system qubit. This aspect of the homogenizer leads to a model of a quantum safe
with a classical combination.We analyze in detail how entanglement between the
reservoir and the system is created during the process of quantum
homogenization. We show that the information about the initial state of the
system qubit is stored in the entanglement between the homogenized qubits.

equation whose spectrum has a continuous part is the Rigged Hilbert Space
rather than just the Hilbert space. The difficulties of using only the Hilbert
space to handle unbounded Schrodinger Hamiltonians whose spectrum has a
continuous part are disclosed. Those difficulties are overcome by using an
appropriate Rigged Hilbert Space (RHS). The RHS is able to associate an
eigenket to each energy in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, regardless of
whether the energy belongs to the discrete or to the continuous part of the
spectrum. The collection of eigenkets corresponding to both discrete and
continuous spectra forms a basis system that can be used to expand any physical
wave function. Thus the RHS treats discrete energies (discrete spectrum) and
scattering energies (continuous spectrum) on the same footing.

number of classical bits. We consider a physical system S interacting locally
with a classical field phi(x) as it travels directly from point A to point B.
The field has the property that its integrated value is an integer multiple of
some constant. The problem is to determine whether the integer is odd or even.
This task can be performed perfectly if S is a qubit. On the otherhand, if S is
a classical system then we show that it must carry an arbitrarily large amount
of classical information. We identify the physical reason for such a huge
quantum advantage, and show that it also implies a large difference between the
size of quantum and classical memories necessary for some computations. We also
present a simple proof that no finite amount of one-way classical communication
can perfectly simulate the effect of quantum entanglement.

the non-relativistic domain (in fact for any symmetry group including internal

can be implemented smoothly by a class of symmetry transformations that project
in the phase space of the joint system. We discuss the interpretation of this
requirement, stressing the fact that any distinction of identical particles
comes solely from the choice of coordinates. We then examine our construction

classes are characterized by the value of a quantity that is invariant under
these transformations, and is defined in terms of the coefficients of a
particular canonical form in which only states in the GHZ class can be
expressed. This invariant also imposes a strong constraint on any POVM that is
part of a deterministic protocol. We also consider a transformation generated
by a local 2-outcome POVM and study under what conditions it is deterministic,
i.e., both outcomes belong to the same orbit. We prove that for real states it
is always possible to find such a POVM and we discuss analytical and numerical
evidence that suggests that this result also holds for complex states. We study
the transformation generated in the space of orbits when one or more parties
apply several deterministic POVMs in succession and use these results to give a

While almost all the earlier theories rest on quasi-probability distribution

\delta-correlated Gaussian noise. For a beam of power P, the important
dimensionless parameter is N=P/\hbar\omega\kappa, the number of photons per
coherence time. For the case of dyne detection, both continuous-wave (cw)
coherent beams and cw (broadband) squeezed beams are considered. For a coherent
beam a simple feedback scheme gives good results, with a phase variance \simeq
N^{-1/2}/2. This is \sqrt{2} times smaller than that achievable by nonadaptive
(heterodyne) detection. For a squeezed beam a more accurate feedback scheme
gives a variance scaling as N^{-2/3}, compared to N^{-1/2} for heterodyne
detection. For the case of interferometry only a coherent input into one port
is considered. The locally optimal feedback scheme is identified, and it is
shown to give a variance scaling as N^{-1/2}. It offers a significant

arbitrary static perturbation of the unitary evolution propagator, and the
integrated time auto-correlation function of the generator of perturbation.
Surprisingly, this relation predicts the slower decay of fidelity the faster
decay of correlations is. In particular, for non-ergodic and non-mixing
dynamics, where asymptotic decay of correlations is absent, a qualitatively
different and faster decay of fidelity is predicted on a time scale 1/delta as
opposed to mixing dynamics where the fidelity is found to decay exponentially
on a time-scale 1/delta^2, where delta is a strength of perturbation. A
detailed discussion of a semi-classical regime of small effective values of
Planck constant is given where classical correlation functions can be used to
predict quantum fidelity decay. Note that the correct and intuitively expected
classical stability behavior is recovered in the classical limit hbar-&gt;0, as
the two limits delta-&gt;0 and hbar-&gt;0 do not commute. In addition we also discuss

physical implementation of the transformation $\varrho^{\otimes n} \to

simplest notion of structural completely positive approximation (SCPA) and
structural physical approximations (SPA) of unphysical map are introduced. Both
always exist for linear hermitian maps and can be optimised under natural
assumptions. However it is shown that some intuitively natural SPA of the
nonlinear operation $\varrho^{\otimes 2} \to \varrho^{2}$ that was already
proven to be unphysical is impossible. It is conjectured that there exist no
SPA of the operation $\varrho^{\otimes n} \to \varrho^{n}$ at all. It is
pointed out that, on the other hand, it is physically possible to measure the
trace of the second power of the state $Tr(\varrho^{2})$ if only two copies of
the system are available. This gives the interpretation of one of Tsallis
entropy as mean value of some ``multicopy'' observable. The (partial)
generalisation of this idea shows that each of higher order Tsallis entropies
can be measured with help of only two multicopy observables. Following this
observations the notion of multicopy entanglement witnesses is defined and

nonmagnetic spherical bodies is calculated, at arbitrary temperatures. Whereas
F has recently been evaluated for the special case of metals (refractive index
n=\infty), here analogous results are presented for dielectrics, and shown
graphically when n=2.0. Our calculational method relies upon quantum
statistical mechanics. The Debye expansions for the Riccati-Bessel functions
when carried out to a high order are found to be very useful in practice
(thereby overflow/underflow problems are easily avoided), and also to give
accurate results even for the lowest values of l. Another virtue of the Debye
expansions is that the limiting case of metals becomes quite amenable to an
analytical treatment in spherical geometry. We first discuss the zero-frequency
TE mode problem from a mathematical viewpoint and then, as physical input,
invoke the actual dispersion relations. The result of our analysis, based upon
adoption of the Drude dispersion relation as the most correct one at low
frequencies, is that the zero-frequency TE mode does not contribute for a
metal. Accordingly, F turns out in this case to be only one half of the
conventional value.

Lagrangian of the system which we derive correct to the first order in the
atomic centre of mass velocity. For the first time using centre of mass
coordinates, a gauge transformation is performed and relevant relativistic
corrections are included. The Lagrangian is symmetric in the electric and
magnetic aspects of the problem and includes two key interaction terms, namely
the Aharanov-Casher and the Roentgen interaction terms. The constitutive
relations, which link the electromagnetic fields to the matter fields via their
electric polarisation and magnetisation, follow from the Lagrangian as well as
the corresponding Hamiltonian. These relations, together with a generalised
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, determine the magnetic (electric) monopole charge
distributions accompanying an order n vortex state when the constituent atoms
are characterised by an electric dipole (magnetic dipole). Field distributions
associated with electric dipole active (magnetic dipole active) BECs in a
vortex state are evaluated for an infinite- and a finite-length cylindrical
BEC. The predictd monopole charge distributions, both electric and magnetic,
automatically satisfy the requirement of global charge neutrality and the
derivations highlight the exact symmetry between the electric and magnetic
properties. Order of magnitude estimates of the effects are given for an atomic

methods for detection, verification and estimation of quantum entanglement are
of great practical importance. Here, we propose an experimentally viable,
\emph{direct} detection of quantum entanglement which is efficient and does not
require any \emph{a priori} knowledge about the quantum state. In a particular

equations for Fermi liquids far from equilibrium. The emphasis is on the
consistent treatment of the off-shell motion between collisions and on the
non-instant and non-local picture of binary collisions. The resulting kinetic
equation is of the Boltzmann type, and it represents an interpolation between
the theory of transport in metals and the theory of moderately dense gases. The
free motion of particles is renormalised by various mean field and mass
corrections in the spirit of Landau's quasiparticles in metals. The collisions
are non-local in the spirit of Enskog's theory of non-ideal gases. The
collisions are moreover non-instant, a feature which is absent in the theory of
gases, but which is shown to be important for dense Fermi systems. In spite of
its formal complexity, the presented theory has a simple implementation within
the Monte-Carlo simulation schemes. Applications in nuclear physics are given
for heavy-ion reactions and the results are compared with the former theory and
recent experimental data. The effect of the off-shell motion and the non-local
and non-instant collisions on the dynamics of the system can be characterised
in terms of thermodynamic functions such as the energy density or the pressure
tensor. Non-equilibrium counterparts of these functions and the corresponding
balance equations are derived and discussed from two points of view. Firstly,
they are used to prove the conservation laws. Secondly, the role of individual
microscopic mechanisms in fluxes of particles and momenta and in
transformations of the energy is clarified.

based on using an unconditionally secure ``quantum channel'' to share a secret
key among two users. A manufacturer of QKD devices could, intentionally or not,
use a (semi-)classical channel instead of the quantum channel, which would
remove the supposedly unconditional security. One example is the BB84 protocol,
where the quantum channel can be implemented in polarization of single photons.
Here, use of several photons instead of one to encode each bit of the key
provides a similar but insecure system. For protocols based on violation of a
Bell inequality (e.g., the Ekert protocol) the situation is somewhat different.
While the possibility is mentioned by some authors, it is generally thought
that an implementation of a (semi-)classical channel will differ significantly
from that of a quantum channel. Here, a counterexample will be given using an
identical physical setup as is used in photon-polarization Ekert QKD. Since the
physical implementation is identical, a manufacturer may include this
modification as a Trojan Horse in manufactured systems, to be activated at will
by an eavesdropper. Thus, the old truth of cryptography still holds: you have
to trust the manufacturer of your cryptographic device. Even when you do
violate the Bell inequality.

  Backward [in Time] Dynamic One that Assigns Causes</title><description>  In this paper we argue that the Sasaki adjunction, which formally encodes the
logicality that different authors tried to attach to the Sasaki hook as a
`quantum implicative connective', has a fundamental dynamic nature and encodes
the so-called `causal duality' (Coecke, Moore and Stubbe 2001;
quant-ph/0009100) for the particular case of a quantum measurement with a
projector as corresponding self-adjoint operator. In particular: The action of
the Sasaki hook $(a\stackrel{S}{\to}-)$ for fixed antecedent $a$ assigns to
some property ``the weakest cause before the measurement of actuality of that
property after the measurement'', i.e. ${(a\stackrel{S}{\to}b)}$ is the weakest
property that guarantees actuality of $b$ after performing the measurement
represented by the projector that has the `subspace $a$' as eigenstates for
eigenvalue 1, say, the measurement that `tests' $a$ . From this we conclude
that the logicality attributable to quantum systems contains a fundamentally
dynamic ingredient: Causal duality actually provides a new dynamic
interpretation of orthomodularity. We also reconsider the status of the Sasaki
hook within `dynamic (operational) quantum logic' (DOQL). We can derive two
labeled dynamic hooks (forwardly and backwardly) that encode how quantum
measurements act on properties. In an even more radical perspective one could
say that the transition from either classical or constructive/intuitionistic
logic to quantum logic entails besides the introduction of an additional unary
connective `operational resolution' (Coecke 2001a; math.LO/0011208) the shift
from a binary connective implication to a ternary connective where two of the
arguments refer to qualities of the system and the third, the new one, to an
obtained outcome (in a measurement).

observables are real functions taking an exact outcome on every (pure) state;
in a quantum theory, at the contrary, a given observable on a given state can
take several values with only a predictable probability. However, even in the
classical case, when an observer is intrinsically unable to distinguish between
some distinct states he can convince himself that the measure of its
''observables'' can have several values in a random way with a statistical
character. What kind of statistical theory is obtainable in this way? It is
possible, for example, to obtain exactly the statistical previsions of quantum
mechanics? Or, in other words, can a physical system showing a classical
behaviour appear to be a quantum system to a confusing observer? We show that
from a mathematical viewpoint it is not difficult to produce a theory with
hidden variables having this property. We don't even try to justify in physical
terms the artificial construction we propose; what we do is to give a general
and rigorous argument showing how the interplay between the classical and
quantum mechanics we offer is interpretable as the difference between an
imaginary very expert observer and another nonexpert observer. This proves also
that besides the well known theorems concerning the impossibility of hidden
variables (cfr. Von Neumann [Neu] and Jauch-Piron [J-P]) there is also room for
a result in favor of the possibility.

a lack of knowledge about a deeper deterministic reality of the measurement
process. We present a quantum machine, where we can illustrate in a simple way
how the quantum structure arises as a consequence of the two mentioned effects.
We introduce a parameter epsilon that measures the size of the lack of
knowledge on the measurement process, and by varying this parameter, we
describe a continuous evolution from a quantum structure (maximal lack of
knowledge) to a classical structure (zero lack of knowledge). We show that for
intermediate values of epsilon we find a new type of structure, that is neither
quantum nor classical. We apply the model that we have introduced to situations
of lack of knowledge about the measurement process appearing in other regions
of reality. More specifically we investigate the quantum-like structures that
appear in the situation of psychological decision processes, where the subject
is influenced during the testing, and forms some of his opinions during the

quantum probabilities are epistemic and not ontological, which means that
quantum mechanics is compatible with a determinism of the whole.

  environment</title><description>  To implement any quantum operation (a.k.a. ``superoperator'' or ``CP map'')
on a d-dimensional quantum system, it is enough to apply a suitable overall
unitary transformation to the system and a d^2-dimensional environment which is
initialized in a fixed pure state. It has been suggested that a d-dimensional
environment might be enough if we could initialize the environment in a mixed
state of our choosing. In this note we show with elementary means that certain
explicit quantum operations cannot be realized in this way. Our counterexamples
map some pure states to pure states, giving strong and easily manageable
conditions on the overall unitary transformation. Everything works in the more
general setting of quantum operations from d-dimensional to d'-dimensional
spaces, so we place our counterexamples within this more general framework.

apparently implied some mysterious, instantaneous action at a distance. This
paradox is supposed to be related to the probabilistic nature of the theory,
but since deterministic alternatives involving &quot;Hidden Variables&quot; hardly agree
with the experiments, the scientific community is now accepting this ``quantum

Quantum Electrodynamics is free from the EPR paradox, due to an indetermination
on the number of the unobserved &quot;soft photons&quot; that can be present in any step
of any experiment. Here, I will provide a more general proof, based on an
approach to the &quot;problem of measurement&quot; that implies the full reconciliation
of Quantum Field Theory with Special Relativity. I will then conclude with some

can be founded on a single protocol, oblivious transfer, from which general
secure multi-party computations can be built.
  The scope of mistrustful quantum cryptography is limited by no-go theorems,
which rule out, inter alia, unconditionally secure quantum protocols for

apply even to protocols which take relativistic signalling constraints into

bit commitment and hence, given the Mayers-Lo-Chau theorem, that
non-relativistic quantum bit string commitment is impossible. Not so: there
exist non-relativistic quantum bit string commitment protocols, with security
parameters $\epsilon$ and $M$, that allow $A$ to commit $N = N(M, \epsilon)$
bits to $B$ so that $A$'s probability of successfully cheating when revealing
any bit and $B$'s probability of extracting more than $N'=N-M$ bits of
information about the $N$ bit string before revelation are both less than
$\epsilon$. With a slightly weakened but still restrictive definition of
security against $A$, $N$ can be taken to be $O(\exp (C N'))$ for a positive

initial state after a forward quantum evolution followed by a backward
perturbed one. It has been conjectured that the echo of a classically chaotic
system decays exponentially, with a decay rate given by the minimum between the
width $\Gamma$ of the local density of states and the Lyapunov exponent. As the
perturbation strength is increased one obtains a cross-over between both
regimes. These predictions are based on situations where the Fermi Golden Rule
(FGR) is valid. By considering a paradigmatic fully chaotic system, the
Bunimovich stadium billiard, with a perturbation in a regime for which the FGR
manifestly does not work, we find a cross over from $\Gamma$ to Lyapunov decay.
We find that, challenging the analytic interpretation, these conjetures are
valid even beyond the expected range.

rational frequency ratios are studied from a global point of view. A
commensurate oscillator possesses the same number of globally defined constants
of motion as an isotropic oscillator. In both cases invariant phase-space
functions form the algebra su(N) with respect to the Poisson bracket. In the
isotropic case, the phase-space flows generated by the invariants can be
integrated globally to a set of finite transformations isomorphic to the group
SU(N). For a commensurate oscillator, however, the group SU(N) of symmetry
transformations is found to exist only on a reduced phase space, due to
unavoidable singularities of the flow in the full phase space. It is therefore
crucial to distinguish carefully between local and global definitions of
symmetry transformations in phase space. This result solves the longstanding
problem of which symmetry to associate with a commensurate harmonic oscillator.

of survival-probability studies, and lately has emerged in the context of
quantum irreversibility studies. In both cases the PID reflects the Lyapunov
instability of the underlying semiclassical dynamics, and it can be
distinguished from the Wigner-type decay that holds in the perturbative regime.
The theory of the survival probability is manifestly related to the parametric
theory of the local density of states (LDOS). In this Paper we demonstrate that
in spite of the common &quot;ideology&quot;, the physics of quantum irreversibility is
{\em not} trivially related to the parametric theory of the LDOS. Rather, it is
essential to take into account subtle cross correlations which are not captured
by the LDOS alone.

However, it makes use of a nonclassical entangled twin-photon light source that

It
is demonstrate that this problem can be treated as two separate problems: a) a

the potential into two components. Finally we obtain the resonance energy and
the partial tunneling widths in terms of the bound and the scattering state
wave functions. This result can be used in a variety of tunneling problems. As

Boolean formulae is reformulated in terms of one-way communication complexity.
We investigate the scenarios of probabilistic formulae, nondeterministic
formulae, and quantum formulae. In all cases we can use results about one-way
communication complexity to prove lower bounds on formula size. In the latter
two cases we newly develop the employed communication complexity bounds. The
main results regarding formula size are as follows: A polynomial size gap
between probabilistic/quantum and deterministic formulae. A near-quadratic size
gap for nondeterministic formulae with limited access to nondeterministic bits.
A near quadratic lower bound on quantum formula size, as well as a polynomial
separation between the sizes of quantum formulae with and without multiple read
random inputs. The methods for quantum and probabilistic formulae employ a
variant of the Neciporuk bound in terms of the VC-dimension. Regarding
communication complexity we give optimal separations between one-way and
two-way protocols in the cases of limited nondeterministic and quantum
communication, and we show that zero-error quantum one-way communication
complexity asymptotically equals deterministic one-way communication complexity
for total functions.

laser fields even though they cannot be ascribed such a role for the

unaffected by arbitrary collective phase noise. Encoding and decoding
procedures reversibly map an arbitrary qubit state from a single data spin to

memory against engineered dephasing with arbitrary strength as well as a
substantial increase in the amount of quantum information retained, relative to
an un-encoded qubit, under both engineered and natural noise processes. In
addition, a universal set of logical manipulations over the encoded qubit is
also realized. Although intrinsic limitations prevent maintaining full noise

in an entangled system of multilevel atoms. The Fourier transform occurs
naturally in the unitary time evolution of energy eigenstates and is used to
define an alternate wave-packet basis for quantum information in the atom. A
change of basis from energy levels to wave packets amounts to a discrete
quantum Fourier transform within each atom. The algorithm then reduces to a
series of conditional phase transforms between two entangled atoms in mixed
energy and wave-packet bases. We show how to implement such transforms using
wave-packet control of the internal states of the ions in the linear ion-trap

  Computing</title><description>  We describe a method for achieving arbitrary 1-qubit gates and controlled-NOT
gates within the context of the Single Cooper Pair Box (SCB) approach to
quantum computing. Such gates are sufficient to support universal quantum
computation. Quantum gate operations are achieved by applying sequences of
voltages and magnetic fluxes to single qubits or pairs of qubits. Neither the
temporal duration, nor the starting time, of a gate operation is used as a
control parameter. As a result, the quantum gates have a constant and known
duration, and depend upon standard control parameter sequences regardless of
when the gate operation begins. This simplifies the integration of quantum
gates into parallel, synchronous, quantum circuits. In addition, we demonstrate
the ability to fabricate such gates, and large-scale quantum circuits, using
current e-beam lithography technology. These features make the SCB-based scheme
a credible contender for practical quantum computer hardware.

  considerations</title><description>  Proposed Silicon-based quantum computer architectures have attracted
attention because of their promise for scalability and their potential for
synergetically utilizing the available resources associated with the existing
infrastructure of the powerful Si technology. Quantitative understanding of and
precise physical control over donor (e.g. Phosphorus) exchange are crucial
elements in the physics underlying the proposed Si-based quantum computer
hardware. An important potential problem in this context is that inter-valley
interference originating from the degeneracy in the Si conduction band edge
causes fast oscillations in donor exchange coupling, which imposes significant
constraints on the Si quantum computer architecture. In this paper we consider
the effect of external strain on Si donor exchange in the context of quantum
computer hardware. We study donor electron exchange in uniaxially strained Si,
since strain partially lifts the valley degeneracy in the bulk. In particular,
we focus on the effects of donor displacements among lattice sites on the
exchange coupling, investigating whether inter-valley interference poses less
of a problem to exchange coupling of donors in strained Si. We show, using the
Kohn-Luttinger envelope function approach, that fast oscillations in exchange
coupling indeed disappear for donor pairs that satisfy certain conditions for
their relative positions, while in other situations the donor exchange coupling
remains oscillatory, with periods close to interatomic spacing. We also comment
on the possible role of controlled external strain in the design and
fabrication of Si quantum computer architecture.

measurements with continuous variable outcomes is presented to establish
criteria for the demonstration of the EPR paradox, for situations where the
correlation between spatially separated subsystems is not perfect. Two types of
criteria for EPR correlations are determined. The first type are based on
measurements of the variances of conditional probability distributions and are
necessary to reflect directly the situation of the original EPR paradox. The
second weaker set of EPR criteria are based on the proven failure of
(Bell-type) local realistic theories which could be consistent with a local
quantum description for each subsystem. The relationship with criteria
sufficient to prove entanglement is established, to show that any demonstration
of EPR correlations will also signify entanglement. It is also shown how a
demonstration of entanglement between two spatially separated subsystems, if
not able to interpreted as a violation of a Bell-type inequality, may be
interpreted as a demonstration of the EPR correlations. In particular it is
explained how the experimental observation of two-mode squeezing using
spatially separated detectors will signify not only entanglement but EPR
correlations defined in a general sense.

correlations for measurements with continuous variable outcomes. Here it is
shown how such EPR criteria, which do not demand perfect EPR correlations, can
be used to prove the extent of security for continuous variable quantum
cryptographic schemes (in analogy to that proposed by Ekert) where Alice and
Bob hope to construct a secure sequence of values from measurements performed
on continuous-variable EPR-correlated fields sent from a distant source. It is
proven that the demonstration of the EPR criterion on Alice's and Bob's joint
statistics compels a necessary loss in the ability to infer the results shared
by Alice and Bob, by measurements performed on any third channel potentially
representing an eavesdropper (Eve). This result makes no assumption about the
nature of the quantum source of the fields transmitted to Alice and Bob, except
that the EPR correlations are observed at the final detector locations. In this
way a means is provided to establish security in the presence of some loss and
less than optimal correlation, and against any eavesdropping strategy employed
by Eve prior to detection of the fields by Alice and Bob.

suppressing decoherence between distinct decoherence free subspaces in quantum
registers. The effect is found in the framework of exact coherent-product
solutions for model registers decohering in a bath of degenerate harmonic
modes, through couplings linear in bath coordinates. These solutions represent
a natural nonequilibrium extension of the standard solution for a decoupled
initial register state and a thermal environment. Under appropriate conditions,
the corresponding reduced register distribution can propagate in an unperturbed
manner, even in the presence of entanglement between states belonging to
distinct decoherence free subspaces, and despite persistent bath entanglement.
As a byproduct, we also obtain a refined picture of coherence dynamics under
bang-bang decoherence control. In particular, it is shown that each
radio-frequency pulse in a typical bang-bang cycle induces a revival of
coherence, and that these revivals are exploited in a natural way by the
time-symmetrized version of the bang-bang protocol.

six-dimensional space and involves vacuum polarization as the background
process. Basic vacuum polarization energy characterised oscillators are

frequencies. The orbits of polarization monopoles are given and shown to be
elliptical on subspaces surfaces. The basic process takes place at the speed of
light and is of a statistical &quot;zitterbewegung&quot; character. The orthodox quantum
probability density bilinear quadratic form is derived from angular momentum
consideration within the system which is shown to be a generalisation of the

Gheorghiu-Svirschevski, Phys.Rev. A 63, 022105 (2001). In addition, based on
the formalism of general interest I developed for the analysis of composite
systems, I show how the variational derivation can be extended to the case of a

turns out to be consistent with the demanding requirements of strong

time evolution along the direction of steepest entropy ascent unfolds at the
fastest rate compatible with the time-energy Heisenberg uncertainty relation.
This ansatz provides a possible well-behaved general closure of the nonlinear
dynamics, compatible with the nontrivial requirements of strong separability,
and with no need of new physical constants. In any case, the time-energy
uncertainty relation provides lower bounds to the internal-relaxation-time

calculate the entanglement between two ions in the steady state of the Dicke
model by tracing over all the other ions. The entanglement in the steady state
is a maximum for the parameter values corresponding roughly to a bifurcation of
a fixed point in the corresponding semiclassical dynamics. We conjecture that
this is a general mechanism for entanglement creation in driven dissipative
quantum systems.

independent quantum states is possible with a certain probability of success.
Here, we consider a variant of that problem. Instead of discriminating among
all of the different states, we shall only discriminate between two subsets of
them. In particular, for the case of three non-orthogonal states, we show that
the optimal strategy to distinguish between a set containing one of the states
from the set containing the other two has a higher success rate than if we wish
to discriminate among all three states. Somewhat surprisingly, for unambiguous
discrimination the subsets need not be linearly independent. A fully analytical
solution is presented, and we also show how to construct generalized

Grassmann variables or Clifford algebras, but simply by generalizing the usual
spinless theory. We only assume the invariance with respect to the Poincare'
group; and only requiring the conservation of the linear and angular momenta we
derive the zitterbewegung: namely the decomposition of the 4-velocity in the
newtonian constant term p/m and in a non-newtonian time-oscillating spacelike
term. Consequently, free classical particles do not obey, in general, the
Principle of Inertia. Superluminal motions are also allowed, without violating
Special Relativity, provided that the energy-momentum moves along the worldline
of the center-of-mass. Moreover, a non-linear, non-constant relation holds
between the time durations measured in different reference frames. Newtonian
Mechanics is re-obtained as a particular case of the present theory: namely for
spinless systems with no zitterbewegung. Introducing a Lagrangian containing
also derivatives of the 4-velocity we get a new equation of the motion,
actually a generalization of the Newton Law a=F/m. Requiring the rotational
symmetry and the reparametrization invariance we derive the classical spin
vector and the conserved scalar Hamiltonian, respectively. We derive also the
classical Dirac spin and analyze the general solution of the Eulero-Lagrange
equation for Dirac particles. The interesting case of spinning systems with
zero intrinsic angular momentum is also studied.

perfectly conducting plate is re-examined. The expression for this force given
by Casimir and Polder represents a mean force, but there are large fluctuations
around this mean value on short time scales which are of the same order of
magnitude as the mean force itself. However, these fluctuations occur on time
scales which are typically of the order of the light travel time between the
atom and the plate. As a consequence, they will not be observed in an
experiment which measures the force averaged over a much longer time. In the
large time limit, the magnitude of the mean squared velocity of a test particle
due to this fluctuating Van der Waals force approaches a constant, and is
similar to a Brownian motion of a test particle in an thermal bath with an
effective temperature. However the fluctuations are not isotropic in this case,
and the shift in the mean square velocity components can even be negative. We
interpret this negative shift to correspond to a reduction in the velocity
spread of a wavepacket. The force fluctuations discussed in this paper are
special case of the more general problem of stress tensor fluctuations. These
are of interest in a variety of areas fo physics, including gravity theory.
Thus the effects of Van der Waals force fluctuations serve as a useful model
for better understanding quantum effects in gravity theory.

reduced by encoding a logical qubit into two qubits, then completely eliminated

the need for single-qubit operations, that pose a difficult design constraint.
We further show how the dominant decoherence processes can be identified

First, we discuss the peculiarities that may occur if the Hilbert space of a

of states with infinite entropy of entanglement is trace-norm dense in state
space, implying that in any neighborhood of every product state there lies an
arbitrarily strongly entangled state. The starting point for a clarification of
this counterintuitive property is the observation that if one imposes the
natural and physically reasonable constraint that the mean energy is bounded
from above, then the entropy of entanglement becomes a trace-norm continuous
functional. The considerations will then be extended to the asymptotic limit,
and we will prove some asymptotic continuity properties. We proceed by
investigating the entanglement of formation and the relative entropy of
entanglement in the infinite-dimensional setting. Finally, we show that the set
of entangled states is still trace-norm dense in state space, even under the
constraint of a finite mean energy.

electron are obtained in the strong coupling regime, when the number of the

model describes a spin interacting with a spin-bath in a strong coupling regime
and gives a dephasing time at zero temperature that agrees with the recent

conduction electron oscillates between the two states with frequency going to

Then, it is shown that the only meaning that can be attached to such

in Albert and Loewer's version of the many minds interpretation there is a
coherent interpretation of the quantum mechanical probabilities. We consider
Albert and Loewer's probability interpretation in the context of Bell-type and
GHZ-type states and argue that it exhibits a certain form of nonlocality which
is, however, much weaker than Bell's nonlocality.

follow--for unitary evolution--directy from the Schr&quot;odinger equation.
Nevertheless, the symmetries of the corresponding evolution operator, the
Liouvillian L=i[.,H], need not be limited to those of the Hamiltonian H. This
is due to L only involving eigenenergy_differences_, which can be degenerate
even if the energies themselves are not. Remarkably, this possibility has
rarely been mentioned in the literature, and never pursued more generally. We
consider an example involving mesoscopic Josephson devices, but the analysis
only assumes familiarity with basic quantum mechanics. Subsequently, such
_L-symmetries_ are shown to occur more widely, in particular also in classical
mechanics. The symmetry's relevance to dissipative systems and
quantum-information processing is briefly discussed.

not realize functions precisely, but approximate them by training on small sets

to solve an undecidable problem, to compute an uncomputable function? According
to Feynman's '82 argument, the answer is {\it negative}. This paper re-opens
the case: we will discuss solutions to a few simple problems which suggest that
{\it quantum computing is {\it theoretically} capable of computing uncomputable
functions}. In this paper a mathematical quantum &quot;device&quot; (with sensitivity
$\epsilon$) is constructed to solve the Halting Problem. The &quot;device&quot; works on
a randomly chosen test-vector for $T$ units of time. If the &quot;device&quot; produces a
click, then the program halts. If it does not produce a click, then either the
program does not halt or the test-vector has been chosen from an {\it
undistinguishable set of vectors} ${\IF}_{\epsilon, T}$. The last case is not
dangerous as our main result proves: {\it the Wiener measure of}
${\IF}_{\epsilon, T}$ {\it constructively tends to zero when} $T$ {\it tends to
infinity}. The &quot;device&quot;, working in time $T$, appropriately computed, will
determine with a pre-established precision whether an arbitrary program halts
or not. {\it Building the &quot;halting machine&quot; is mathematically possible.}

exist. Since the security of many fundamental cryptographic primitives depends
on the hardness of finding collisions, quantum lower bounds for the collision
problem would provide evidence for the existence of cryptographic primitives
that are immune to quantum cryptanalysis.
  In this paper, we prove that any quantum algorithm for finding a collision in
an r-to-one function must evaluate the function Omega((n/r)^{1/3}) times, where
n is the size of the domain and r|n. This improves the previous best lower
bound of Omega((n/r)^{1/5}) evaluations due to Aaronson [quant-ph/0111102], and
is tight up to a constant factor.

or not the given n real numbers are distinct. The previous best lower bound is
Omega(sqrt{n}} queries in the black-box model; and Omega(sqrt{n}log{n})

the new wave unification between quantum mechanics and general relativity is
shown by a wave interpretation of three experimental phenomena that lie

wave Compton effect leads us to discover a mechanism of wave resonance which is
able to verify the possible existence of a source of elementary waves that
shows a wave model of electron and all the particles. The wave nature of masses

consider the inertia as a local consequence of the wave structure of bodies.
The same changeable wave model used for explaining inertia it is also valid to

swap of coherent states and cloning of coherent ones. We construct the swap

  Interacting Quantum systems</title><description>  A self-consistent, non-perturbative scheme of approximation is proposed for
arbitrary interacting quantum systems by generalization of the Hartree
method.The scheme consists in approximating the original interaction term
$\lambda H_I$ by a suitable 'potential' $\lambda V(\phi)$ which satisfies the
following two requirements: (i) the 'Hartree Hamiltonian' $H_o$ generated by
$V(\phi)$ is exactly solvable i.e, the eigen states $|n&gt;$ and the eigenvalues
$E_n$ are known and (ii) the 'quantum averages' of the two are equal, i.e. $&lt;
n|H_I|n&gt;$ = $&lt;n|V(\phi)|n&gt;$ for arbitrary $'n '$. The leading-order results for
$|n&gt;$ and $E_n$, which are already accurate, can be systematically improved
further by the development of a 'Hartree-improved perturbation theory' (HIPT)
with $H_o$ as the unperturbed part and the modified interaction:$\lambda
H^{\prime} \equiv \lambda (H_I-V)$ as the perturbation. The HIPT is assured of
rapid convergence because of the 'Hartree condtion' : $&lt;n| H'| n&gt; = 0$. This is
in contrast to the naive perturbation theory developed with the original
interaction term $\lambda H_I$ chosen as the perturbation, which diverges even
for infinitesimal $\lambda$ ! The structure of the Hartree vacuum is shown to
be highly non-trivial. Application of the method to the anharmonic-and
double-well quartic-oscillators, anharmonic- sextic and octic- oscillators
leads to very accurate results for the energy levels. In case of $\lambda
\phi^{4}$ quantum field theory, the method reproduces, in the leading order,
the results of Gaussian approximation, which can be improved further by the
HIPT. We study the vacuum structure, renormalisation and stability of the
theory in GHA.

\bra{\psi_k}$ in infinitely many ways. A physically realizable (PR) ensemble is

Some, but not all, ensembles are PR. This constitutes the preferred ensemble
fact, with the PR ensembles being the preferred ensembles. We present the
necessary and sufficient conditions for a given ensemble to be PR, and

of the space of symmetric matrices F^{ab} [corresponding to the canonical
momentum pi^{ab}(x_0) and of symmetric matrices {G_{ab}}[corresponding to the
canonical metric g_{ab}(x_0), where 1 \leq a,b \leq n, and, crucially, the

Metrical Quantization, the first and most important ingredient is the
specification of a suitable metric on classical phase space. Our choice of
phase space metrics, guided by a recent study of Affine Quantum Gravity, leads
to gravitational phase space geometries which possess constant scalar curvature
and may be regarded as higher dimensional analogs of the Poincare plane, which
applies when n=1. This result is important because phase spaces endowed with
such symmetry lead naturally via the procedures of Metrical Quantization to
acceptable Hilbert spaces of high dimension.

corresponding to the density of states, as well as those of the partition

the small-t asymptotic expansion of the heat kernel of an operator in terms of

dramatically on the singularity structure of the zeta function. The different
specific situations that can appear are discussed in detail, using seminal

involving zeta functions with a non-standard pole structure (as those arising
in noncommutative theories and others). Finally, some misuses of the classical

  differential geometry?</title><description>  The rules of quantum mechanics require a time coordinate for their
formulation. However, a notion of time is in general possible only when a
classical spacetime geometry exists. Such a geometry is itself produced by
classical matter sources. Thus it could be said that the currently known
formulation of quantum mechanics pre-assumes the presence of classical matter
fields. A more fundamental formulation of quantum mechanics should exist, which
avoids having to use a notion of time. In this paper we discuss as to how such
a fundamental formulation could be constructed for single particle,
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. We argue that there is an underlying
non-linear theory of quantum gravity, to which both standard quantum mechanics
and classical general relativity are approximations. The timeless formulation
of quantum mechanics follows from the underlying theory when the mass of the
particle is much smaller than Planck mass. On the other hand, when the
particle's mass is much larger than Planck mass, spacetime emerges and the
underlying theory should reduce to classical mechanics and general relativity.
We also suggest that noncommutative differential geometry is a possible
candidate for describing this underlying theory.

rule out unconditionally secure QBC as a matter of principle, because there

respectively. Within this framework, the dynamics of an electron bunch in a

discuss theoretical and experimental results for traveling-wave feedback,
emphasizing how the ``in-loop'' squeezing (also known as ``squashing'') differs
from free squeezing. Although such feedback, based on ordinary (demolition)
photodetection cannot create free squeezing, it can be used to manipulate it.
Then I treat feedback based on nonlinear quantum optical measurements (of which
non-demolition measurements are one example). These {\em are} able to produce
free squeezing, as shown in a number of experiments. Following that I discuss
theories showing that intracavity squeezing can be increased using ordinary
feedback, and produced using QND-based feedback. Finally, I return to
``squashed'' fields and present recent results showing that the reduced in-loop
fluctuations can suppress atomic decay in a manner analogous to the effect for
squeezed fields.

is shown to belong to $BPP^C$ and $BQP^C$ (depending on the ability of the
oracle C to clone either a binary random variable or a qubit). The same result
is extended in the case of an approximate cloning oracle, thus establishing
that $NP \subseteq BPP^C \subseteq BQP^C$ and $NP \subseteq BPP^{AC} \subseteq
BQP^{AC}$, where C and AC are the exact and approximate cloning oracles,
respectively. Although exact cloning is impossible in quantum systems,
approximate cloning remains a possibility. However, the best known methods for
approximate cloning (based on unitary evolution) do not currently achieve the
desired precision levels. And it remains an open question whether they could be
improved when non-linear (or non-unitary) operators are used. Finally, a
straightforward attempt to dispense with cloning, replacing it by unitary
evolution, is proved to be impossible.

`perspectival' (`relational', `relative state') version of the modal
interpretation of quantum mechanics. We show that if we assume certain features
of discreteness and determinism in the operation of the measuring device (which
could be a part of the observer's nerve system), this gives rise to classical
characteristics of the observed properties, in the first place to spatial
localization. We investigate to what extent semi-classical behavior of the
object system itself (as opposed to the observational system) is needed for the
emergence of classicality. Decoherence is an essential element in the mechanism
of observation that we assume, but it turns out that in our approach no
environment-induced decoherence on the level of the object system is required
for the emergence of classical properties.

  timing information</title><description>  The statistical state of any (classical or quantum) system with non-trivial
time evolution can be interpreted as the pointer of a clock. The quality of
such a clock is given by the statistical distinguishability of its states at
different times. If a clock is used as a resource for producing another one the
latter can at most have the quality of the resource. We show that this
principle, formalized by a quasi-order, implies constraints on many physical
processes. Similarly, the degree to which two (quantum or classical) clocks are
synchronized can be formalized by a quasi-order of synchronism.
  Copying timing information is restricted by quantum no-cloning and
no-broadcasting theorems since classical clocks can only exist in the limit of
infinite energy. We show this quantitatively by comparing the Fisher timing
information of two output systems to the input's timing information. For
classical signal processing in the quantum regime our results imply that a
signal looses its localization in time if it is amplified and distributed to
many devices.

evolution typically causes chaotic quantum systems to generate structure that
varies on the scale of phase-space volume elements of size $(\hbar^2/A)^d$,
where A is a classical action characteristic of the state and d is the number
of degrees of freedom, and that (2) this structure implies that a small change
in a phase-space coordinate X by an amount $\delta X \sim \hbar X/A$
generically results in an orthogonal state. While we agree with (1), we argue
that (2) is not correct if the number of degrees of freedom is small. Our
arguments are based on the Berry-Voros ansatz for the structure of energy
eigenstates in chaotic systems. We find, however, that (2) becomes valid if the
number of degrees of freedom is large. This implies that many-body environments
may be crucial for the phenomenon of quantum decoherence.

parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in media with inhomogeneous distributions of
second-order nonlinearity. As a special case, we explore interference effects
from SPDC generated in a cascade of two bulk crystals separated by an air gap.
The polarization quantum-interference pattern is found to vary strongly with
the spacing between the two crystals. This is found to be a cooperative effect
due to two mechanisms: the chromatic dispersion of the medium separating the
crystals and spatiotemporal effects which arise from the inclusion of
transverse wave vectors. These effects provide two concomitant avenues for
controlling the quantum state generated in SPDC. We expect these results to be

  Ensembles of Pure States</title><description>  As discussed in Wiseman and Vaccaro [quant-ph/9906125], the stationary state
of an optical or atom laser far above threshold is a mixture of coherent field
states with random phase, or, equivalently, a Poissonian mixture of number
states. We are interested in which, if either, of these descriptions of
$\rho_{ss}$, is more natural. In the preceding paper we concentrated upon
whether descriptions such as these are physically realizable (PR). In this
paper we investigate another relevant aspect of these ensembles, their
robustness. A robust ensemble is one for which the pure states that comprise it
survive relatively unchanged for a long time under the system evolution. We
determine numerically the most robust ensembles as a function of the parameters
in the laser model: the self-energy $\chi$ of the bosons in the laser mode, and
the excess phase noise $\nu$. We find that these most robust ensembles are PR
ensembles, or similar to PR ensembles, for all values of these parameters. In
the ideal laser limit ($\nu=\chi=0$), the most robust states are coherent
states. As the phase noise $\nu$ or phase dispersion $\chi$ is increased, the
most robust states become increasingly amplitude-squeezed. We find scaling laws
for these states. As the phase diffusion or dispersion becomes so large that
the laser output is no longer quantum coherent, the most robust states become
so squeezed that they cease to have a well-defined coherent amplitude. That is,
the quantum coherence of the laser output is manifest in the most robust PR
states having a well-defined coherent amplitude. This lends support to the idea
that robust PR ensembles are the most natural description of the state of the
laser mode. It also has interesting implications for atom lasers in particular,
for which phase dispersion due to self-interactions is expected to be large.

  Hidden-Variables Theories</title><description>  It is proven that any deterministic hidden-variables theory, that reproduces
quantum theory for a 'quantum equilibrium' distribution of hidden variables,
must predict the existence of instantaneous signals at the statistical level
for hypothetical 'nonequilibrium ensembles'. This 'signal-locality theorem'
generalises yet another feature of the pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and
Bohm, for which it is already known that signal-locality is true only in
equilibrium. Assuming certain symmetries, lower bounds are derived on the
'degree of nonlocality' of the singlet state, defined as the (equilibrium)
fraction of outcomes at one wing of an EPR-experiment that change in response
to a shift in the distant angular setting. It is shown by explicit calculation
that these bounds are satisfied by pilot-wave theory. The degree of nonlocality
is interpreted as the average number of bits of 'subquantum information'
transmitted superluminally, for an equilibrium ensemble. It is proposed that
this quantity might provide a novel measure of the entanglement of a quantum
state, and that the field of quantum information would benefit from a more
explicit hidden-variables approach. It is argued that the signal-locality
theorem supports the hypothesis, made elsewhere, that in the remote past the
universe relaxed to a state of statistical equilibrium at the hidden-variable
level, a state in which nonlocality happens to be masked by quantum noise.

coarse graining that conceptually underlies classical statistical mechanics. We
introduce some extra degrees of freedom that are necessary for this.
Interaction between these degrees and the system can be understood as a process
of resonant absorption and emission of ``soft quanta''. This intuitive picture
allows one to state a criterion for when self thermalization occurs. This
paradigm also provides a method for calculating the thermalization rate using
the usual formalism of atomic physics for calculating decay rates. We contrast
our prescription for coarse graining, which is somewhat dynamical, with the
earlier approaches that are intrinsically kinematical. An important motivation

independent-particle states, and, at the same time, the most localized states
in the Husimi representation. Therefore delocalization of the Husimi
distribution, which can be measured by the moments, is a sign of many-body
correlation (entanglement). Since the delocalization of the Husimi distribution
is also related to chaoticity of the dynamics, it suggests a relation between
entanglement and chaos. Our definition of the Husimi distribution can be
applied not only to the systems of distinguishable particles, but also to those

The energy spectrum and wave functions in standing-wave (SW)- and

entanglement. Within the model, quantum thermodynamic entropy is also related
to directed entanglement, and a simple proof of the second law of
thermodynamics is given.

  algorithm in a homo-nuclear system</title><description>  Compared with classical search algorithms, Grover quantum algorithm [ Phys.
Rev. Lett., 79, 325(1997)] achieves quadratic speedup and Bruschweiler hybrid
quantum algorithm [Phys. Rev. Lett., 85, 4815(2000)] achieves an exponential
speedup. In this paper, we report the experimental realization of the
Bruschweiler$ algorithm in a 3-qubit NMR ensemble system. The pulse sequences
are used for the algorithms and the measurement method used here is improved on
that used by Bruschweiler, namely, instead of quantitatively measuring the spin
projection of the ancilla bit, we utilize the shape of the ancilla bit
spectrum. By simply judging the downwardness or upwardness of the corresponding
peaks in an ancilla bit spectrum, the bit value of the marked state can be read
out, especially, the geometric nature of this read-out can make the results
more robust against errors.

is investigated. It is shown, that in the strong perturbations regime (in
contrast to the weak one), higher perturbations rate does not necessarily
improve the activation. In fact, in this regime two rival factors play a role,
and as a consequence, this tunneling system behaves like a sensitive
frequency-shifter device: for most incident particles' energies activation
occurs and the particles are energetically elevated, while for specific
energies activation is depressed and the transmission is very low. This effect
is unique to the strong perturbation regime, and it is totally absent in the
weak perturbation case. Moreover, it cannot be deduced even in the adiabatic
regime. It is conjectured that this mechanism can be used as a
frequency-dependent transistor, in which the device's transmission is governed
by the external field frequency.

interaction required to perform the gate when assisting the process with fast
local unitaries. This cost, of interest both in the areas of quantum control
and quantum information, depends on the specific interaction, and allows to
compare in an operationally meaningful manner any two non-local gates. In the
case of a two-qubit system, an analytical expression for the interaction cost
of any unitary operation given any coupling Hamiltonian is obtained. One gate
may be more time-consuming than another for any possible interaction. This
defines a partial order structure in the set of non-local gates, that compares
their degree of non-locality. We analytically characterize this partial order
in a region of the set of two-qubit gates.

  quantum states</title><description>  A measurement strategy is developed for a new kind of hypothesis testing. It
assigns, with minimum probability of error, the state of a quantum system to
one or the other of two complementary subsets of a set of N given
non-orthogonal quantum states occurring with given a priori probabilities. A
general analytical solution is obtained for N states that are restricted to a
two-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space of the system. The result for the
special case of three arbitrary but linearly dependent states is applied to a
variety of sets of three states that are symmetric and equally probable. It is
found that, in this case, the minimum error probability for distinguishing one
of the states from the other two is only about half as large as the minimum
error probability for distinguishing all three states individually.

impose a serious constraint on quantum bit commitment (QBC). As a way to
circumvent them, it is proposed that the quantum system encoding the commitment
chosen by the committer (Alice) should be initially prepared in a seperable
quantum state known to and furnished by the acceptor (Bob), rather than Alice.
Classical communication is used to conclude the commitment phase and bind
Alice's subsequent unveiling. Such a class of secure protocols can be built
upon currently proposed QBC schemes impervious to a simple EPR attack. A
specific scheme based on the Brassard-Crepeau-Josza-Langlois protocol is
presented here as an example.

4059), we started a systematic study of the connections among different
factorization types, suggested by Infeld and Hull, and of their consequences
for the construction of algebras. We devised a general procedure for
constructing satellite algebras for all the Hamiltonians admitting a type E
factorization by using the relationship between type A and E factorizations.
Here we complete our analysis by showing that for Hamiltonians admitting a type
F factorization, a similar method, starting from either type B or type C ones,
leads to other types of algebras. We therefore conclude that the existence of
satellite algebras is a characteristic property of type E factorizable
Hamiltonians. Our results are illustrated with the detailed discussion of the
Coulomb problem.

  nuclear magnetic resonance</title><description>  The number of steps any classical computer requires in order to find the
prime factors of an $l$-digit integer $N$ increases exponentially with $l$, at
least using algorithms known at present. Factoring large integers is therefore
conjectured to be intractable classically, an observation underlying the
security of widely used cryptographic codes. Quantum computers, however, could
factor integers in only polynomial time, using Shor's quantum factoring
algorithm. Although important for the study of quantum computers, experimental
demonstration of this algorithm has proved elusive. Here we report an
implementation of the simplest instance of Shor's algorithm: factorization of
${N=15}$ (whose prime factors are 3 and 5). We use seven spin-1/2 nuclei in a
molecule as quantum bits, which can be manipulated with room temperature liquid
state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This method of using nuclei to
store quantum information is in principle scalable to many quantum bit systems,
but such scalability is not implied by the present work. The significance of
our work lies in the demonstration of experimental and theoretical techniques
for precise control and modelling of complex quantum computers. In particular,
we present a simple, parameter-free but predictive model of decoherence effects
in our system.

  Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  Recently, Brukner and Zeilinger (2001) have claimed that the Shannon
information is not well defined as a measure of information in quantum
mechanics, adducing arguments that seek to show that it is inextricably tied to
classical notions of measurement. It is shown here that these arguments do not
succeed: the Shannon information does not have problematic ties to classical
concepts. In a further argument, Brukner and Zeilinger compare the Shannon
information unfavourably to their preferred measure, I(p), with regard to the
definition of a notion of `total information content'. This argument is found
unconvincing and the relationship between individual measures of information
and notions of `total information content' investigated. We close by
considering the prospects of Zeilinger's Foundational Principle as a
foundational principle for quantum mechanics

because there is no observable for the time taken by a particle to transmit (or
reflect) from a particular region. Several methods have been proposed based on
scattering phase shifts and using different quantum clocks, where the time
taken is clocked by some external input or indirectly from the phase of the
scattering amplitudes. In this work we give a general method for calculating
conditional sojourn times based on wave attenuation. In this approach clock
mechanism does not couple to the Hamiltonian of the system. For simplicity,
specific case of a delta dimer is considered in detail. Our analysis re-affirms
recent results based on correcting quantum clocks using optical potential
methods, albeit in a much simpler way.

elementary quantum logic gates. If the computational basis is represented by a
component of spin and physical implementations obey the angular momentum
conservation law, any physically realizable unitary operators with size less
than n qubits cannot implement the controlled-NOT gate within the error
probability 1/(4n^2), where the size is defined as the total number of the
computational qubits and the ancilla qubits. An analogous limit for bosonic
ancillae is also obtained to show that the lower bound of the error probability
is inversely proportional to the average number of photons. Any set of
universal gates inevitably obeys a related limitation with error probability
O(1/n^2)$. To circumvent the above or related limitations yielded by
conservation laws, it is recommended that the computational basis should be
chosen as the one commuting with the additively conserved quantities.
