for base-band pulses. When a band-limited pulse is applied as the input, a
forwarded pulse appears at the output. The negative group delays in lumped
systems share the same mechanism with the superluminal light propagation, which
is recently demonstrated in an absorption-free, anomalous dispersive medium
[Wang et al., Nature 406, 277 (2000)]. In this circuit, the advance time more
than twenty percent of the pulse width can easily be achieved. The time
constants, which can be in the order of seconds, is slow enough to be observed
with the naked eye by looking at the lamps driven by the pulses.

  Schr\&quot;odinger equations</title><description>  We introduce a new, more general type of nonlinear gauge transformation in
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics that involves derivatives of the wave
function and belongs to the class of B\&quot;acklund transformations. These
transformations satisfy certain reasonable, previously proposed requirements
for gauge transformations. Their application to the Schr\&quot;odinger equation
results in higher order partial differential equations. As an example, we
derive a general family of 6th-order nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger equations, closed
under our nonlinear gauge group. We also introduce a new gauge invariant
current ${\bf \sigma}=\rho {\bf \nabla}\triangle \ln \rho $, where
$\rho=\bar\psi \psi$. We derive gauge invariant quantities, and characterize
the subclass of the 6th-order equations that is gauge equivalent to the free
Schr\&quot;odinger equation. We relate our development to nonlinear equations
studied by Doebner and Goldin, and by Puszkarz.

refraction increases before a saturation with the electric field; adding a
small perturbation which increases the index with the magnetic field, and
neglecting the absorption, a filament curves and closes into a torus. This
transformation of a (2+1)D soliton into a (3+0)D soliton shows the existence of
those solitons, while a complete study, with a larger magnetic effect, would
require numerical computations, the starting point being, possibly, the
perturbed, curved filament.
  The flux of energy in the regular filaments is nearly a ''critical flux'',
depending slightly on the external fields, so that the energy of the (3+0)D
soliton is quantified, but may be slightly changed by external interactions.
  The nearly linear part of the soliton, an evanescent wave, is partly
transmitted by Young holes, making transmitted and reflected interference
patterns, thus index variations which guide the remainder of the soliton, just
as de Broglie's pilot waves.
  The creation of electron positron pairs in the vacuum by purely
electromagnetic fields shows a nonlinearity of vacuum at high energies;
supposing this nonlinearity convenient, elementary particles may be (3+0)D
solitons or light bullets, so that it may be a connection with the superstrings
theory.

quantum query complexity of read-once Boolean functions, providing evidence for
the conjecture that $\Omega(\sqrt{D(f)})$ is a lower bound for all Boolean
functions. Our technique extends a result of Ambainis, based on the idea that
successful computation of a function requires ``decoherence'' of initially
coherently superposed inputs in the query register, having different values of
the function. The number of queries is bounded by comparing the required total
amount of decoherence of a judiciously selected set of input-output pairs to an
upper bound on the amount achievable in a single query step. We use an
extension of this result to general weights on input pairs, and general
superpositions of inputs.

projectors form a basis for operators acting on the input Hilbert space. If a
protocol (1) uses only forward communication and entanglement, (2)
deterministically prepares an exact copy of the state, and (3) does so
obliviously -- without leaking further information about the state to the
receiver -- then the protocol can be modified to require from the sender only a
single specimen of the state. Furthermore, the original protocol and the
modified protocol use the same amount of classical communication. Thus, under
the three conditions stated, remote state preparation requires at least as much
classical communication as teleportation, as Lo has conjectured [PRA 62 (2000)
012313], which is twice the expected classical communication cost of some
existing nonoblivious protocols.

monochromatic interactions (ac-dc fields), providing a complete perturbative

which we develop in a more systematic way here. For being free of secular terms
and uniformly convergent in time, our expansions allow a rigorous study of the
long-time behaviour of such systems and are also well-suited for numerical
computations, as we briefly discuss, leading to very accurate calculations of
quantities like transition probabilities for very long times compared to the
cycles of the external field.

maximally compact subgroup U(2) of Sp(4,R) to mix the modes, thus allowing us

the pair coherent states turns out to be analytically diagonalisable, giving us
a handle over its least eigenvalue, through which we are able to pin down the
squeezing properties of these states. In order to explicitly demonstrate the

for quantum dynamical systems is analised from the point of view of quantum
information theory. Using a general quantum dynamical system as a communication
channel one can define different classical capacities depending on the
character of resources applied for encoding and decoding procedures and on the
type of information sources. It is shown that for Bernoulli sources the
entanglement-assisted classical capacity, which is the largest one, is bounded
from above by the quantum dynamical entropy defined in terms of operational
partitions of unity. Stronger results are proved for the particular class of

manifestations of one covariant entity. The nature of transition from the
confined quarks to plasma-like partons is studied in terms of the entropy and
temperature coming from the time-separation variable. According to Einstein,

string and M theory may be interpreted as non-local hidden variables theories
in which the quantum observables are the eigenvalues of the matrices while
their entries are the non-local hidden variables. This is shown by studying the
bosonic matrix model at finite temperature, with T taken to scale as 1/N. For
large N the eigenvalues of the matrices undergo Brownian motion due to the
interaction of the diagonal elements with the off diagonal elements, giving
rise to a diffusion constant that remains finite as N goes to infinity. The
resulting probability density and current for the eigenvalues are then found to
evolve in agreement with the Schroedinger equation, to leading order in 1/N.
The quantum fluctuations and uncertainties in the eigenvalues are then
consequences of ordinary statistical fluctuations in the values of the
off-diagonal matrix elements. This formulation of the quantum theory is
background independent, as the definition of the thermal ensemble makes no use
of a particular classical solution. The derivation relies on Nelson's
stochastic formulation of quantum theory, which is expressed in terms of a
variational principle.

functions which vanish at all points of a mesh but one, leads to simple
mesh-like equations which also allow an accurate description of scattering.
These methods are shown to be exactly equivalent for any basis size, with or

accurately derive poles of the scattering matrix in the R-matrix formalism and
suggests how to extend the Siegert-pseudostate method to higher partial waves.
The different concepts are illustrated with the Bargmann potential and with the

provide new rational inequalities necessary for the separability of bipartite
quantum states . Using Quantum Permanents, we give deterministic poly-time

moving in an arbitrary magnetic field has a nonadiabatic geometric phase
proportional to the solid angle subtended by the trace of the spin. For neutral
particles with higher spin, this is true for cyclic solutions with special
initial conditions. For more general cyclic solutions, however, this does not
hold. As an example, we consider the most general solutions of such particles
moving in a rotating magnetic field. If the parameters of the system are
appropriately chosen, all solutions are cyclic. The nonadiabatic geometric
phase and the solid angle are both calculated explicitly. It turns out that the
nonadiabatic geometric phase contains an extra term in addition to the one
proportional to the solid angle. The extra term vanishes automatically for spin
1/2. For higher spin, however, it depends on the initial condition. We also
consider the valence electron of an alkaline atom. For cyclic solutions with
special initial conditions in an arbitrary strong magnetic field, we prove that
the nonadiabatic geometric phase is a linear combination of the two solid
angles subtended by the traces of the orbit and spin angular momenta. For more
general cyclic solutions in a strong rotating magnetic field, the nonadiabatic
geometric phase also contains extra terms in addition to the linear
combination.

phase space. In this setting Maslov's pseudodifferential operator version of
WKB analysis applies and represents these two problems via a common higher
dimensional Schrodinger evolution, but with different extended Hamiltonians.
The evolution of a Lagrangian manifold in the extended phase space, defined by
initial data, controls the phase, amplitude and caustic behavior. The
symplectic area phases arise as a solution of a boundary condition problem.
Various applications and examples are considered.

security of quantum key distribution schemes. Nonetheless, up till now, a local
commutability constraint in the CSS code construction means that the error
correction and privacy amplification procedures of BB84 are not fully
decoupled. Here, I provide a method to decouple the two processes completely.
The method requires Alice and Bob to share some initial secret string and use
it to encrypt the bit-flip error syndrome using one-time-pad encryption. As an
application, I prove the unconditional security of the interactive Cascade
protocol, proposed by Brassard and Salvail for error correction, modified by
one-time-pad encryption of the error syndrome, and followed by the random
matrix protocol for privacy amplification. This is an efficient protocol in
terms of both computational power and key generation rate.

first one - $SUSY-$ separation of variables - is based on the intertwining
relations of Higher order SUSY Quantum Mechanics (HSUSY QM) with supercharges
allowing for separation of variables. 2)The second one is a generalization of
shape invariance. While in one dimension shape invariance allows to solve
algebraically a class of (exactly solvable) quantum problems, its
generalization to higher dimensions has not been yet explored. Here we provide
a formal framework in HSUSY QM for two-dimensional quantum mechanical systems
for which shape invariance holds. Given the knowledge of one eigenvalue and
eigenfunction, shape invariance allows to construct a chain of new
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. These methods are applied to a two-dimensional
quantum system, and partial explicit solvability is achieved in the sense that
only part of the spectrum is found analytically and a limited set of
eigenfunctions is constructed explicitly.

 The modulus of the quantum overlap of mean field states naturally introduces a
classical distance between classical phase points. Using this fact we
analytically show that the time rate of change (trc) of two neighbouring

mean field dynamics and we show that they can be given in terms of classical

the corresponding relativistic wave equations. Connections between the

two energy scales into the study of chaotic systems: One is obviously the mean
level spacing $\Delta\propto\hbar^d$, where $d$ is the dimensionality; The
other is $\Delta_b\propto\hbar$, which is known as the non-universal energy
scale, or as the bandwidth, or as the Thouless energy. Associated with these
two energy scales are two special quantum-mechanical (QM) regimes in the theory
of driven system. These are the QM adiabatic regime, and the QM
non-perturbative regime respectively. Otherwise Fermi golden rule applies, and
linear response theory can be trusted. Demonstrations of this general idea,
that had been published in 1999, have appeared in studies of wavepacket
dynamics, survival probability, dissipation, quantum irreversibility, fidelity

coherent theory of mathematics and physics together is described. The main
characteristic of such a theory is discussed: the theory must be valid and and
sufficiently strong, and it must maximally describe its own validity and
sufficient strength. The mathematical logical definition of validity is used,
and sufficient strength is seen to be a necessary and useful concept. The
requirement of maximal description of its own validity and sufficient strength
may be useful to reject candidate coherent theories for which the description
is less than maximal. Other aspects of a coherent theory discussed include
universal applicability, the relation to the anthropic principle, and possible
uniqueness. It is suggested that the basic properties of the physical and
mathematical universes are entwined with and emerge with a coherent theory.
Support for this includes the indirect reality status of properties of very
small or very large far away systems compared to moderate sized nearby systems.
Discussion of the necessary physical nature of language includes physical
models of language and a proof that the meaning content of expressions of any
axiomatizable theory seems to be independent of the algorithmic complexity of
the theory. G\&quot;{o}del maps seem to be less useful for a coherent theory than
for purely mathematical theories because all symbols and words of any language
musthave representations as states of physical systems already in the domain of
a coherent theory.

the Green function descriptions using the example of the square barrier
potential. By imposing different boundary conditions on the time independent
Schrodinger equation, we obtain either eigenvectors corresponding to real
eigenvalues and the physical spectrum or eigenvectors corresponding to complex
eigenvalues (Gamow vectors) and the resonance spectrum. We show that the poles
of the S matrix are the same as the poles of the Green function and are the
complex eigenvalues of the Schrodinger equation subject to a purely outgoing
boundary condition. The intrinsic time asymmetry of the purely outgoing
boundary condition is discussed. Finally, we show that the probability of
detecting the decay within a shell around the origin of the decaying state
follows an exponential law if the Gamow vector (resonance) contribution to this
probability is the only contribution that is taken into account.

by which two or more observers may combine {\em independently} obtained states
of knowledge together to form a new state of knowledge, which is the state
which would be possessed by someone having the combined information of both
observers. Moreover, this combined state of knowledge can be found without
reference to the manner in which the respective observers obtained their
information. However, in this note we show that in general this is not possible
for quantum states of knowledge; in order to combine two quantum states of
knowledge to obtain the state resulting from the combined information of both
observers, these observers must also possess information about how their
respective states of knowledge were obtained. Nevertheless, we emphasize this
does not preclude the possibility that a unique, well motivated rule for
combining quantum states of knowledge without reference to a measurement
history could be found. We examine both the direct quantum analogue of the
classical problem, and that of quantum state-estimation, which corresponds to a
variant in which the observers share a specific kind of prior information.

provides a link between supersymmetric quantum mechanics and quantum
(super)integrability is introduced. By realization of the method in two
dimensions, two infinite families of superintegrable and isospectral stationary
potentials are generated. The method makes it possible to perform Darboux
transformations in such a way that, in addition to the isospectral property,
they acquire the superintegrability preserving property. Symmetry generators
are second and fourth order in derivatives and all potentials are isospectral
with one of the Smorodinsky-Winternitz potentials. Explicit expressions of the
potentials, their dynamical symmetry generators and the algebra they obey as
well as their degenerate spectra and corresponding normalizable states are
presented.

development of new quantum algorithms. The strategy chosen is to begin by
focusing on the class of abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms, i.e., the
class of abelian algorithms of the Shor/Simon genre. Our strategy is to make
this class of algorithms as mathematically transparent as possible. By the
phrase &quot;mathematically transparent&quot; we mean to expose, to bring to the surface,
and to make explicit the concealed mathematical structures that are inherently
and fundamentally a part of such algorithms. In so doing, we create symbolic
abelian quantum hidden subgroup algorithms that are analogous to the those
symbolic algorithms found within such software packages as Axiom, Cayley,
Maple, Mathematica, and Magma.
  As a spin-off of this effort, we create three different generalizations of
Shor's quantum factoring algorithm to free abelian groups of finite rank. We
refer to these algorithms as wandering (or vintage Z_Q) Shor algorithms. They
are essentially quantum algorithms on free abelian groups A of finite rank n
which, with each iteration, first select a random cyclic direct summand Z of
the group A and then apply one iteration of the standard Shor algorithm to
produce a random character of the &quot;approximating&quot; finite group A=Z_Q, called
the group probe. These characters are then in turn used to find either the
order P of a maximal cyclic subgroup Z_P of the hidden quotient group H_phi, or
the entire hidden quotient group H_phi. An integral part of these wandering
quantum algorithms is the selection of a very special random transversal, which
we refer to as a Shor transversal. The algorithmic time complexity of the first
of these wandering Shor algorithms is found to be O(n^2(lgQ)^3(lglgQ)^(n+1)).

(a &quot;quantum multimeter&quot;). That is, a device that would be able to perform
various desired generalized, positive operator value measure (POVM)
measurements depending on a quantum state of a &quot;program register&quot;. As an
example, we present a &quot;universal state discriminator&quot;. It serves for the
unambiguous discrimination of a pair of known non-orthogonal states (from a
certain set). If the two states are changed the apparatus can be switched via
the choice of the program register to discriminate the new pair of states
unambiguously. The proper POVM is determined by the state of an auxiliary
quantum system. The probability of successful discrimination is not optimal for
all pairs of non-orthogonal states from the given set. However, for some

wave length of a few centimeters, for electrons propagating along a magnetic
field. This followed from the predictions of a probability amplitude theory by
the author in the classical macrodomain of the dynamics of charged particles in
a magnetic field. It is shown in this paper that this case constitutes only a
special case of a generic situation whereby composite systems such as atoms and
molecules in their highly excited internal states,can exhibit matter wave
manifestation in macro and mesodomains. The wave length of these waves is
determined, not by the mass of the particle as in the case of the de Broglie
wave, but by the frequency, associated with the internal state of excitation,
and is given by a nonquantal expression, $\lambda =2\pi v/\omega$, $v$ being
the velocity of the particle. For the electrons in a magnetic field the
frequency corresponds to the gyrofrequency, $\Omega$ and the nonquantal wave
length is given by $\lambda = 2\pi v_{\parallel}/\Omega$; $v_{\parallel}$ being
the velocity of electrons along the magnetic field.

evolving from an initial coherent superposition. Analysis of time-dependent
trajectory ensembles, flux maps, and elements of the stress tensor for two
composite systems, in one of which the system is uncoupled to the environment,
leads to the decoherence mechanism. For the uncoupled case, the quantum force
acting on the fluid elements directs flux toward an attractor where the
interference feature arises. For the coupled case, the classical force acting
on each fluid element counters the quantum force and leads to gradual
separation of the components of the initial superposition. Concomitantly, fluid
stress is relieved when flux vectors diverge from a repellor in the mid-region
between the separating wavepackets, thus suppressing formation of the
interference feature.

usually taken to imply that phase space structures associated with sub-Planck
($\ll \hbar$) scales do not exist, or, at the very least, that they do not
matter. I show that this deeply ingrained prejudice is false: Non-local
&quot;Schr\&quot;odinger cat&quot; states of quantum systems confined to phase space volume
characterized by `the classical action' $A \gg \hbar$ develop spotty structure
on scales corresponding to sub-Planck $a = \hbar^2 / A \ll \hbar$. Such
structures arise especially quickly in quantum versions of classically chaotic
systems (such as gases, modelled by chaotic scattering of molecules), that are
driven into nonlocal Schr\&quot;odinger cat -- like superpositions by the quantum
manifestations of the exponential sensitivity to perturbations$^2$. Most
importantly, these sub-Planck scales are physically significant: $a$ determines
sensitivity of a quantum system (or of a quantum environment) to perturbations.
Therefore sub-Planck $a$ controls the effectiveness of decoherence and
einselection caused by the environment$^{3-8}$. It may also be relevant in
setting limits on sensitivity of Schr\&quot;odinger cats used as detectors.

statistical estimation of superoperators and their generators, from a wide

teleporting an entangled photon with such high quality that the nonlocal
quantum correlations with its original partner photon are preserved. This

  in the He-Ion</title><description>  Entanglement may be considered a resource for quantum-information processing,
as the origin of robust and universal equilibrium behaviour, but also as a
limit to the validity of an effective potential approach, in which the
influence of certain interacting subsystems is treated as a potential. Here we
show that a closed three particle (two protons, one electron) model of a He-ion
featuring realistic size, interactions and energy scales of electron and
nucleus, respectively, exhibits different types of dynamics depending on the
initial state: For some cases the traditional approach, in which the nucleus
only appears as the center of a Coulomb potential, is valid, in others this
approach fails due to entanglement arising on a short time-scale. Eventually
the system can even show signatures of thermodynamical behaviour, i.e. the
electron may relax to a maximum local entropy state which is, to some extent,
independent of the details of the initial state.

  General Permittivities</title><description>  The Casimir mutual free energy F for a system of two dielectric concentric
nonmagnetic spherical bodies is calculated, at arbitrary temperatures. The
present paper is a continuation of an earlier investigation [Phys. Rev. E {\bf
63}, 051101 (2001)], in which F was evaluated in full only for the case of
ideal metals (refractive index n=infinity). Here, analogous results are
presented for dielectrics, for some chosen values of n. Our basic calculational
method stems from quantum statistical mechanics. The Debye expansions for the
Riccati-Bessel functions when carried out to a high order are found to be very
useful in practice (thereby overflow/underflow problems are easily avoided),
and also to give accurate results even for the lowest values of l down to l=1.
Another virtue of the Debye expansions is that the limiting case of metals
becomes quite amenable to an analytical treatment in spherical geometry. We
first discuss the zero-frequency TE mode problem from a mathematical viewpoint
and then, as a physical input, invoke the actual dispersion relations. The
result of our analysis, based upon the adoption of the Drude dispersion
relation at low frequencies, is that the zero-frequency TE mode does not
contribute for a real metal. Accordingly, F turns out in this case to be only
one half of the conventional value at high temperatures. The applicability of
the Drude model in this context has however been questioned recently, and we do
not aim at a complete discussion of this issue here. Existing experiments are
low-temperature experiments, and are so far not accurate enough to distinguish
between the different predictions. We also calculate explicitly the
contribution from the zero-frequency mode for a dielectric. For a dielectric,
this zero-frequency problem is absent.

upper and lower bounds on their power. We show any $\NC^1$ language can be

unboundedly with input size, is necessary if the quantum algorithm is to offer
an exponential speed-up over classical computation. Furthermore we prove that
the algorithm can be classically efficiently simulated to within a prescribed
tolerance \eta even if a suitably small amount of global entanglement
(depending on \eta) is present. We explicitly identify the occurrence of
increasing multi-partite entanglement in Shor's algorithm. Our results do not
apply to quantum algorithms operating on mixed states in general and we discuss
the suggestion that an exponential computational speed-up might be possible
with mixed states in the total absence of entanglement. Finally, despite the
essential role of entanglement for pure state algorithms, we argue that it is
nevertheless misleading to view entanglement as a key resource for quantum
computational power.

using a polylogarithmic ($O(\log^k n), k\geq 1$) number of qubits and a
polylogarithmic number of computation steps. The current research in the
literature has focussed on using a polynomial number of qubits. A new
mathematical model of computation called \emph{Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs)}
is defined, building on Deutsch's model of quantum computational network. The
model introduces a nonlinear and irreversible gate, similar to the speculative
operator defined by Abrams and Lloyd. The precise dynamics of this operator are
defined and while giving examples in which nonlinear Schr\&quot;{o}dinger's
equations are applied, we speculate on its possible implementation. The many
practical problems associated with the current model of quantum computing are
alleviated in the new model. It is shown that QNNs of logarithmic size and
constant depth have the same computational power as threshold circuits, which
are used for modeling neural networks. QNNs of polylogarithmic size and
polylogarithmic depth can solve the problems in \NC, the class of problems with
theoretically fast parallel solutions. Thus, the new model may indeed provide
an approach for building scalable parallel computers.

continuously monitored open quantum system. The first is Markovian feedback as
introduced in quantum optics by Wiseman and Milburn [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 70},
548 (1993)]. The second is feedback based on an estimate of the system state,
developed recently by Doherty {\em et al.} [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 62}, 012105
(2000)]. Here we choose to call it, for brevity, {\em Bayesian feedback}. For
systems with nonlinear dynamics, we expect these two methods of feedback
control to give markedly different results. The simplest possible nonlinear
system is a driven and damped two-level atom, so we choose this as our model
system. The monitoring is taken to be homodyne detection of the atomic
fluorescence, and the control is by modulating the driving. The aim of the
feedback in both cases is to stabilize the internal state of the atom as close
as possible to an arbitrarily chosen pure state, in the presence of inefficient
detection and other forms of decoherence. Our results (obtain without recourse
to stochastic simulations) prove that Bayesian feedback is never inferior, and
is usually superior, to Markovian feedback. However it would be far more
difficult to implement than Markovian feedback and it loses its superiority
when obvious simplifying approximations are made. It is thus not clear which
form of feedback would be better in the face of inevitable experimental
imperfections.

two-level atoms with a supply of energy called the pump and a sink of energy,
perhaps an optical detector. The latter converts the light energy into a
sequence of electrical pulses corresponding to photo-detection events. It was
predicted in 1984 on the basis of Quantum Optics and verified experimentally
shortly thereafter that when the pump is non-fluctuating the emitted light does
not fluctuate much. Precisely, this means that the variance of the number of
photo-detection events observed over a sufficiently long period of time is much
smaller than the average number of events. Light having that property is said
to be ``sub-Poissonian''. The theory presented rests on the concept introduced
by Einstein around 1905, asserting that matter may exchange energy with a wave
at angular frequency $\omega$ only by multiples of $\hbar\omega$. The optical
field energy may only vary by integral multiples of $\hbar\omega$ as a result
of matter quantization and conservation of energy. A number of important
results relating to isolated optical cavities containing two-level atoms are
first established on the basis of the laws of Statistical Mechanics. Next, the
laser system with a pump and an absorber of radiation is treated. The
expression of the photo-current spectral density found in that manner coincides
with the Quantum Optics result. The concepts employed in this paper are
intuitive and the algebra is elementary. The paper supplements a previous OQE
tutorial paper in establishing a connection between the theory of laser noise
and Statistical Mechanics.

are known to give rise to a long-range attractive force between metal plates
(Casimir effect). For ferromagnetic layers separated by vacuum, it is shown
that the interplay of the Casimir effect and of the magneto-optical Kerr effect
gives rise to a long-range magnetic interaction. The Casimir magnetic force is
found to decay as $D^{-1}$ in the limit of short distances, and as $D^{-5}$ in
the limit of long distances. Explicit expressions for realistic systems are
given in the large and small distance limits. An experimental test of the
Casimir magnetic interaction is proposed.

Bose-Einstein condensate. Specifically we consider relative number squeezing
between photons and atoms coupled out from a homogeneous condensate. We study
the decay of excited quasiparticle modes due to collisions, in condensates of
atoms with one or two internal degrees of freedom. The time evolution of these
modes is determined in the linear response approximation to the deviation from
equilibrium. We use Heisenberg-Langevin equations to derive equations of motion
for the densities and higher correlation functions which determine the
squeezing. In this way we can show that decoherence due to quasiparticle
interactions imposes an important limit on the degree of number squeezing which
may be achieved. Our results are also relevant for the determination of
decoherence times in other experiments based on entanglement, e.g. the slowing

The approach relies on the creation of localized spin waves, ``spin solitons'',

Casimir force between real metals were recently computed by several authors
using different approaches based on the Lifshitz formula with diverse results.
Both the Drude and plasma models were used to describe a real metal. We
calculate the entropy density of photons between metallic plates as a function
of the surface separation and temperature. Some of these approaches are
demonstrated to lead to negative values of entropy and to nonzero entropy at
zero temperature depending on the parameters of the system. The conclusion is
that these approaches are in contradiction with the third law of thermodynamics
and must be rejected. It is shown that the plasma dielectric function in
combination with the unmodified Lifshitz formula is in perfect agreement with
the general principles of thermodynamics. As to the Drude dielectric function,
the modification of the zero-frequency term of the Lifshitz formula is outlined

asymptotically. We verify if initial anisotropies can also be suppressed in a
quantum version of a classical anisotropic model where gravity is coupled to a
perfect fluid. Employing a Bianchi I cosmological model, we obtain a
&quot;Schr\&quot;odinger-like&quot; equation where the matter variables play de role of time.
This equation has a hyperbolic signature. It can be explicitly solved and a
wave packet is constructed. The expectation value of the scale factor,
evaluated in the spirit of the many-worlds interpretation, reveals an isotropic
Universe. On the other hand, the bohmian trajectories indicate the existence of
anisotropies. This is an example where the Bohm-de Broglie and the many-worlds

linear optical elements and SP quantum non-demolition measurements. An unknown
SP polarization state can be faithfully teleported either to a duplicate
polarization state or to an entangled state. Our proposal can be used to

rebits, which are binary quantum objects confined to a real state space. We
consider states of the ring that maximize the correlation between nearest

non-trivial parallel transport around the ring. An analogy is made with lattice
gauge theory, in which non-trivial parallel transport around closed loops is
associated with a reduction in the probability of the field configuration. We

quantum teleportation, and quantum cryptography. The ability to quantify this
resource correctly has thus become of great interest to those working in the
field of quantum information theory. In this paper, we show that all existing
entanglement measures but one fail important tests of fitness when applied to n
particle, m site states of indistinguishable particles, where n,m&gt;=2. The
accepted method of measuring the entanglement of a bipartite system of
distinguishable particles is to use the von Neumann entropy of the reduced
density matrix of one half of the system. We show that expressing the full
density matrix using a site-spin occupation number basis, and reducing with
respect to that basis, gives an entanglement which meets all currently known
fitness criteria for systems composed of either distinguishable or
indistinguishable particles.
  We consider an output state from a previously published thought experiment, a
state which is entangled in both spin and spatial degrees of freedom, and show
that the site entropy measure gives the correct total entanglement. We also
show how the spin-space entanglement transfer occurring within the apparatus
can be understood in terms of the transfer of probability from single-occupancy
to double-occupancy sectors of the density matrix.

understand black hole entropy as reflecting degeneracy of the observable

  An alternative is considered here: a probabilistic theory of hidden variables
underlying quantum mechanics could be statistically local, in the sense that it
supplies global configuration probabilities which are defined by expressions

strengths we find a sudden change in the photon statistics of the light emitted

narrow range of intracavity photon number. It is proven that this sudden change
in photon statistics occurs due to the existence of robust quantum interference
of transitions between the dressed states of the atom-cavity system.
Furthermore, it is shown that the strong photon bunching is a nonclassical

this way of analysis to models where such a behavior is not generally expected.
In order to obtain significant results we approach the problem by a
renormalization group method that can give a fixed point Hamiltonian that has
the shape of a harmonic oscillator. In this way, good approximations are
obtained for the ground state both for the eigenfunction and the eigenvalue for
problems like the quartic oscillator, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential
having a not normalizable ground state solution and for the one-dimensional
Kramers-Henneberger potential. We keep a coupling constant in the potential and
take it running with a generic cut-off that goes to infinity. The solution of
the Callan-Symanzik equation for the coupling constant generates the harmonic
oscillator Hamiltonian describing the behavior of the model at very small
distances (ultraviolet behavior). This approach, although algorithmic in its
very nature, does not appear to have a simple extension to obtain excited state

the interaction of a system of N two-level atoms in a cavity of high quality
factor with a strong classical driving field. It is shown that, with a
judicious choice of the cavity detuning and the applied coherent field
detuning, vacuum Rabi coupling produces a large number of important

atoms by cavity QED, our proposal does not require the strong coupling regime

the cavity decay rate, and \Gamma is the decay rate of the atoms. In this work
the important parameter is Ng^2/\kappa\Gamma, where N is the number of atoms,
and our proposal permits the production of entanglement in bad cavities as long

The expected ubiquitous vacuum polarization characteristic of QFT is confined
to the lightray (longitudinal) direction, whereas operators whose localization
is transversely separated are completely free of vacuum correlations. This
unexpected ''transverse return to QM'' combined with the rather universal
nature of the strongly longitudinal correlated vacuum correlations (which turn
out to be described by rather kinematical chiral theories) leads to a d-2
dimensional area structure of the d-1 dimensional lightfront theory. An
additive transcription in terms of an appropriately defined entropy related to
the vacuum restricted to the horizon is proposed and its model independent
universality aspects which permit its interpretation as a quantum candidate for
Bekenstein's area law are discussed. The transverse tensor product foliation

  principles of quantum theory</title><description>  The model of the physical system with discrete interactions is based on the
postulates that
  (i) parameters of the physical system are defined in process of its
interaction;
  (ii) the process of interaction is discrete.
  Consequently ordering of the events in the system is not automatically
implied based on the values of time, but must be specified explicitly. This
suggests the specific logic of events as well as complex character of the
function, which describes stochastic behavior of the system, hence the
parameters of the system are defined by Hermitian operators in the Hilbert
space of functions.
  The model gives an essential way to introduce the basic notions and obtain
the results of the quantum theory, to derive the meaning of the main physical
parameters, such as momentum or electric charge. Based on the proposed
postulates, Schrodinger equation for the particle is deduced in a way similar
to inferring of Smoluchowski equation in the classical statistical mechanics.
  Similarly, the equations of motion of linear fields are established by
considering Smoluchowski-type equations for amplitudes of harmonics.
  The concept of discrete interaction gives a way to de-couple the object of
experiment and a testing device (the traditional source of controversy in
quantum theory), though at expense of limitation of the principle of locality.

  particle in space and in time</title><description>  The principles of behavior of the system with discrete interactions are
applied to description of motion of the relativistic particle. Applying the
concept of non-local behavior both to position in space and to time, the
apparently covariant equation of motion of the particle (Klein-Gordon) is
defined. Based on the assumption that the form of the equation has to be
invariant in inertial reference frames, the principle of constancy of the speed
of light can be deduced. Consequently the basic statements of special
relativity can be established in relation to the principles of discrete
interaction.
  The condition that Klein-Gordon equation was established without explicit use
of the principle of correspondence gives a way to specify the area of
applicability of the statement about the speed of light as the maximal speed of
propagation of information. This would permit interpretation of superluminal
phenomena with no contradictions to special relativity.
  The conventional interpretation of time as a category which specifies
succession and coexistence of events leads to interpreting of the Klein-Gordon
and related equations (such as Maxwell or Dirac) as equations of the fields.
This would justify the procedure of second quantization, so that the states of
the field are identified with the sets of particles.

Taking advantage of the fact that the Wigner function is always positive in
parametric down conversion experiments, we construct a local hidden variables
model where the amplitudes of the field modes are taken as random variables
whose probability distribution is the Wigner function. In order to achieve our
goal we give a model of detection which is fully local but departs from quantum
theory. In our model the zeropoint (vacuum) level of radiation lies below a
threshold of the detectors and only signals above the threshold are detectable.
The predictions of the model agree with those of quantum mechanics if the
signal intensities surpase some level and the efficiency is low. This is
consistent with the known fact that quantum mechanics is compatible with local
realism in that case (a fact called the ``efficiency loophole''). Our model
gives a number of constraints which do not follow from the quantum theory of
detection and are experimentally testable.

correlations are shared by the parties. In the bipartite case we show that the
mutual information is a secrecy monotone. In the multipartite case we describe
two different generalisations of the mutual information, both of which are
secrecy monotones. The existence of two distinct secrecy monotones allows us to
show that in multipartite quantum cryptography the parties must make
irreversible choices about which multipartite correlations they want to obtain.
Secrecy monotones can be extended to the quantum domain and are then defined on
density matrices. We illustrate this generalisation by considering tri-partite
quantum cryptography based on the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. We

driven by periodic fields in terms of new convergent perturbative expansions
for the associated propagator U(t). The main virtue of these expansions is that
they do not contain secular terms, leading to a very convenient method for
quantitatively studying the long-time behaviour of that systems. We present a
complete description of an algorithm to numerically compute the perturbative

ac-dc field (monochromatic interaction), exploring various situations and
showing results on (time-dependent) observable quantities, like transition
probabilities. For a simple ac field, we analised particular situations where
an approximate effect of dynamical localisation is exhibited by the driven
system. The accuracy of our calculations was tested measuring the unitarity of
the propagator U(t), resulting in very small deviations, even for very long

physical interpretation? In the Markovian limit, where the system {\em on
average} obeys a master equation, the answer is yes. Markovian stochastic
Schr\&quot;odinger equations generate quantum trajectories for the system state
conditioned on continuously monitoring the bath. For a given master equation,
there are many different unravelings, corresponding to different sorts of
measurement on the bath. In this paper we address the non-Markovian case, and
in particular the sort of stochastic \sch equation introduced by Strunz, Di\'
osi, and Gisin [Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 1801 (1999)]. Using a quantum measurement
theory approach, we rederive their unraveling which involves complex-valued
Gaussian noise. We also derive an unraveling involving real-valued Gaussian
noise. We show that in the Markovian limit, these two unravelings correspond to
heterodyne and homodyne detection respectively. Although we use quantum
measurement theory to define these unravelings, we conclude that the stochastic
evolution of the system state is not a true quantum trajectory, as the identity
of the state through time is a fiction.

general dyne measurements when the mean photon number is fixed, both for
general states and squeezed states. I propose a new feedback scheme that
introduces far less phase uncertainty than mark II feedback, and is very close
to the theoretical limit. I also derive results for the phase variance when
there is a time delay in the feedback loop, showing that there is a lower limit
to the introduced phase variance, and this is approached quite accurately under
some conditions. I derive the optimum input states for interferometry, showing
that the phase uncertainty scales as 1/N for all the common measures of
uncertainty. This is contrasted with the |j0&gt;_z state, which does not scale as
1/N for all measures of phase uncertainty. I introduce an adaptive feedback
scheme that is very close to optimum, and can give scaling very close to 1/N
for the uncertainty. Lastly I consider the case of continuous measurements, for
both the dyne and interferometric cases.

practical point of view, the proposed algorithm may result in an exponential
speedup, compared to known quantum and classical summing algorithms. However in
general, this advantage exists only if the total number of function samples is
below a threshold value which depends on the measurement sensitivity.

other physicists, as together we've tried to learn some cryptography, but also
from conversations with a couple of classical cryptographers. The main thrust
of the paper is an attempt to explore the ramifications for cryptographic
security of incorporating physics into our thinking at every level. I begin by
discussing two fundamental cryptographic principles, namely that security must
not rely on secrecy of the protocol and that our local environment must be
secure, from a physical perspective. I go on to explain why by definition a
particular cryptographic task, oblivious transfer, is inconsistent with a
belief in the validity of quantum mechanics. More precisely, oblivious transfer
defines states and operations that do not exist in any (complex) Hilbert space.
I go on to argue the fallaciousness of a &quot;black box&quot; approach to quantum
cryptography, in which classical cryptographers just trust physicists to
provide them with secure quantum cryptographic sub-protocols, which they then
attempt to incorporate into larger cryptographic systems. Lest quantum
cryptographers begin to feel too smug, I discuss the fact that current
implementations of quantum key distribution are only technologically secure,
and not &quot;unconditionally&quot; secure as is sometimes claimed. I next examine the
concept of a secure lab from a physical perspective, and end by making some
observations about the cryptographic significance of the (often overlooked)
necessity for parties who wish to communicate having established physical
reference frames.

potential barrier may become not small under the action of the specially
adapted non-stationary signal which selects the certain particle energy E_R.
For particle energies close to this value, the tunneling rate is not small
during a finite interval of time and has a very sharp peak at the energy E_R.
After entering inside the barrier, the particle emits electromagnetic quanta
and exits the barrier with a lower energy. The signal amplitude can be much
less compared to the field of the static barrier. This phenomenon can be called
the Euclidean resonance since the under-barrier motion occurs in imaginary
time. The resonance may stimulate chemical and biochemical reactions in a
selective way by adapting the signal to a certain particular chemical bond. The
resonance may be used in search of the soft alpha-decay for which a
conventional observation is impossible due to an extremely small decay rate.

  Partitioning</title><description>  We have developed a general technique to study the dynamics of the quantum
adiabatic evolution algorithm applied to random combinatorial optimization
problems in the asymptotic limit of large problem size $n$. We use as an
example the NP-complete Number Partitioning problem and map the algorithm
dynamics to that of an auxilary quantum spin glass system with the slowly
varying Hamiltonian. We use a Green function method to obtain the adiabatic
eigenstates and the minimum excitation gap, $g_{\rm min}={\cal O}(n 2^{-n/2})$,
corresponding to the exponential complexity of the algorithm for Number
Partitioning. The key element of the analysis is the conditional energy
distribution computed for the set of all spin configurations generated from a
given (ancestor) configuration by simulteneous fipping of a fixed number of
spins. For the problem in question this distribution is shown to depend on the
ancestor spin configuration only via a certain parameter related to the energy
of the configuration. As the result, the algorithm dynamics can be described in
terms of one-dimenssional quantum diffusion in the energy space. This effect
provides a general limitation on the power of a quantum adiabatic computation
in random optimization problems. Analytical results are in agreement with the
numerical simulation of the algorithm.

study simple but realistic systems which can be solved. An example of such a
system is the 1D infinite-lattice anisotropic XY model. This model is exactly
solvable using the Jordan-Wigner transform, and it is possible to calculate the
two-site reduced density matrix for all pairs of sites. Using the two-site
density matrix, the entanglement of formation between any two sites is
calculated for all parameter values and temperatures. We also study the
entanglement in the transverse Ising model, a special case of the XY model,
which exhibits a quantum phase transition. It is found that the next-nearest
neighbour entanglement (though not the nearest-neighbour entanglement) is a
maximum at the critical point. Furthermore, we show that the critical point in
the transverse Ising model corresponds to a transition in the behaviour of the
entanglement between a single site and the remainder of the lattice.

Neumann) entropy of all particles. As expected, decoherence is understood both
as a statistical process that is caused by the dynamics of the system, and also
as a matter of entropy. Moreover, the concept of decoherence time is applicable
in closed systems and we have solved its behaviour in the Heisenberg model with
respect to particle number N, density \rho and spatial dimension D in a 1/r

these types of systems: in an N=1000 particle system the recurrence time is
close to the order of the age of the universe. This encourages us to conclude
that decoherence is the solution for quantum-classical problems not only in

each representing the feature of the pattern class ${\cal C}_1$ or ${\cal

This is an extension of the pattern matching problem into the quantum domain.
Assuming that these states are known a priori to belong to a certain parametric
family of pure qubit systems, we derive two kinds of matching strategies. The
first is a semiclassical strategy which is obtained by the natural extension of
conventional matching strategies and consists of a two-stage procedure:
identification (estimation) of the unknown template states to design the
classifier (\textit{learning} process to train the classifier) and
classification of the input system into the appropriate pattern class based on
the estimated results. The other is a fully quantum strategy without any
intermediate measurement which we might call as the {\it universal quantum
matching machine}. We present the Bayes optimal solutions for both strategies
in the case of K=1, showing that there certainly exists a fully quantum
matching procedure which is strictly superior to the straightforward
semiclassical extension of the conventional matching strategy based on the
learning process.

communication without quantum communication. The scheme remains secure if
quantum communication is allowed between certain partners, and can be designed
for any choice of quantum communication patterns to be secure, but to allow
near perfect recovery for all other patterns. The maximal probability of
unwanted recovery of the hidden bit, as well as the maximal error for allowed

high dimensional systems at each site. No entanglement is needed since the

  Particles</title><description>  In quantum computation, it is of paramount importance to locate the parameter
space where maximal coherence can be preserved in the qubit system. In recent
years environment-induced decoherence based the quantum Brownian motion (QBM)
models have been applied to two level systems (2LS) interacting with an
electromagnetic field, leading to the general belief that 2LS are easily
decohered. In a recent paper C. Anastopoulos and B. L. Hu [Phys. Rev. A62,
(2000) 033821] derived a new exact non-Markovian master equation at zero
temperature, from which they showed that this belief is actually misplaced. For
a two-level atom (2LA)- electromagnetic field (EMF) system the decoherence time
is rather long, comparable to the relaxation time. Theoretically this is
because the dominant interaction is the $\hat \sigma_{\pm}$ type of coupling
between the two levels (what constitutes the qubit) and the field, not the
$\hat \sigma_z$ type, which shows the QBM behavior. Depending on the coupling
the field can act as a resonator (in an atom cavity) or as a bath (in QBM) and
produce very different decoherent behavior in the system. This is not new to
Cavity QED experimentalists: the 2LA-EMF system maintaining its coherence in
sufficiently long duration is the reason why they can manipulate them so well
to show interesting quantum coherence effects.

spin in the lowest Landau level. The spectrum of the real bosonic system is
identical to the one of the effective fermions, with the same eigenvalues and
the same density of states. When the ratio of the number of atoms to the spin
degeneracy is an integer number, the ground state for the effective fermions is
an integer quantum Hall state. The corresponding bosonic state is a fractional
quantum Hall liquid whose filling factor ranges in the sequence nu=1/2, 2/3,
3/4, ..., as the spin degeneracy increases. Anyons with 1/2,1/3,1/4, ...

c-NOT gates with nearest neighbors. Though initially we begin with pure states
of varying boundary conditions, the updating with time quickly involves a
complicated entanglement involving all or most nodes. As a normal c-NOT gate,
though unitary for a single pair of nodes, seems to be not so when used in a
network in a naive way, we use a manifestly unitary form of the transition
matrix with c?-NOT gates, which invert the phase as well as flipping the qubit.
This leads to complete entanglement of the net, but with variable coefficients
for the different components of the superposition. It is interesting to note
that by a simple logical back projection the original input state can be
recovered in most cases. We also prove that it is not possible for a sequence
of unitary operators working on a net to make it move from an aperiodic regime
to a periodic one, unlike some classical cases where phase-locking happens in
course of evolution. However, we show that it is possible to introduce by hand
periodic orbits to sets of initial states, which may be useful in forming
dynamic pattern recognition systems.

spacetime dependence of quantum phenomena is neglected. However the
transmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in
spacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,
channel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space
and time. In particlular we suggest that instead of a two level system (qubit)
the basic notion in a relativistic quantum information theory should be a
notion of an elementary quantum system, i.e. an infinite dimensional Hilbert
space $H$ invariant under an irreducible representation of the Poincare group
labeled by $[m,s]$ where $m\geq 0$ is mass and $s=0,1/2,1,...$ is spin. We
emphasize an importance of consideration of quantum information theory from the
point of view of quantum field theory. We point out and discuss a fundamental
fact that in quantum field theory there is a statistical dependence between two
regions in spacetime even if they are spacelike separated. A classical
probabilistic representation for a family of correlation functions in quantum
field theory is obtained. Entangled states in space and time are considered. It
is shown that any reasonable state in relativistic quantum field theory becomes
disentangled (factorizable) at large spacelike distances if one makes local
observations. As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed
without inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if
the distance between detectors is rather small. We suggest a further
experimental study of entangled states in spacetime by studying the dependence
of the correlation functions on the distance between detectors.

for general dynamical systems on static background spacetimes and establish a
connection between quantum weak energy inequalities and thermodynamic stability
in the general setting. We show that the free scalar field in representations
induced by quasifree Hadamard states provides an example system, and we
indicate that (1) the microlocal spectrum condition, (2) quantum weak energy

  space</title><description>  Almost all novel observable phenomena in quantum optics are related to the
quantum coherence. The coherence here is determined by the relative phase
inside a state. Unfortunately, so far all the relevant experimental results in
quantum optics are insensitive to the phase information of the coherent state.
Lack of phase information may cause serious consequences in many problems in
quantum optics. For example, an ensemble of two mode squeezed states is a
classical ensemble if the phase in each state is totally random; but it is a
non-classical ensemble if the phase in each state is fixed. As a timly
application, verification of this type of phase information in an ensemble of
two mode squeezed states from the conventional laser is crucial to the validity
of the continuous variavable quantum teleportation(CVQT) experiment. Here we
give a simple scheme to distinguish two different ensemble of states: the
Rudolph-Sanders ensemble, by which each squeezed states emitted has a uniform
distribution from $0-2\pi$ on the phase value; and the van Enk-Fuchs ensemble,
which emmits identical states with a fixed(but unknown) phase for every state.
We believe our proposal can help to give a clear picture on whether the
existing two mode squeezed states so far are indeed non-classical states which
can be used as the entanglement resource.

Wigner functions. These often become singular or negative in the full quantum
regime. In this paper a simple approach to non-Markovian theory of quantum
Brownian motion using {\it true probability distribution functions} is
presented. Based on an initial coherent state representation of the bath
oscillators and an equilibrium canonical distribution of the quantum mechanical
mean values of their co-ordinates and momenta we derive a generalized quantum
Langevin equation in $c$-numbers and show that the latter is amenable to a
theoretical analysis in terms of the classical theory of non-Markovian

leads to a set of central requirements for candidate computing devices, in
addition to the basic ones of stable qubits and controllable gates and

geometry and hierarchy of communication needs; a computer whose physical
architecture is designed to reflect this will be able to tolerate the most
noise. The relevant networks are dominated by quantum information transport,
therefore to assess a computing device it is necessary to characterize its
ability to transport quantum information, in addition to assessing the
performance of conditional logic on nearest neighbours and the passive
stability of the memory. The transport distances involved in QEC networks are
estimated, and it is found that a device relying on swap operations for

functions. Entanglement leads to the strongest counter-intuitive feature of
quantum mechanics, namely nonlocality. Experimental realization of quantum
entanglement is relatively easy for the case of photons; a pump photon can
spontaneously split into a pair of entangled photons inside a nonlinear
crystal. In this paper we combine quantum entanglement with nanostructured
metal optics in the form of optically thick metal films perforated with a
periodic array of subwavelength holes. These arrays act as photonic crystals
that may convert entangled photons into surface-plasmon waves, i.e.,
compressive charge density waves. We address the question whether the
entanglement survives such a conversion. We find that, in principle, optical
excitation of the surface plasmon modes of a metal is a coherent process at the
single-particle level. However, the quality of the plasmon-assisted
entanglement is limited by spatial dispersion of the hole arrays. This spatial
dispersion is due to the nonlocal dielectric response of a metal, which is
particularly large in the plasmonic regime; it introduces &quot;which way&quot; labels,

between two qubits, consistent with this bound. A quantum channel can be
thought of as a &quot;structure&quot; or collection of frameworks, and the physical
location of the information in the individual frameworks can be used to
identify the location of the channel. Analysis of a quantum circuit used as a
model of teleportation shows that the location of the channel depends upon
which structure is employed; for ordinary teleportation it is not (contrary to
Deutsch and Hayden) present in the two bits resulting from the Bell-basis
measurement, but in correlations of these with a distant qubit. In neither
teleportation nor dense coding does information travel backwards in time, nor
is it transmitted by nonlocal (superluminal) influences. It is (tentatively)
proposed that all aspects of quantum information can in principle be understood
in terms of the (basically classical) behavior of information in a particular
framework, along with the framework dependence of this information.

  During Twisted Rapid Passage with Possible Application to Quantum Computing</title><description>  In an adiabatic rapid passage experiment, the Bloch vector of a two-level
system (qubit) is inverted by slowly inverting an external field to which it is
coupled, and along which it is initially aligned. In twisted rapid passage, the
external field is allowed to twist around its initial direction with azimuthal
angle $\phi (t)$ at the same time that it is inverted. For polynomial twist:
$\phi (t) \sim Bt^{n}$. We show that for $n \geq 3$, multiple avoided crossings
can occur during the inversion of the external field, and that these crossings
give rise to strong interference effects in the qubit transition probability.
The transition probability is found to be a function of the twist strength $B$,
which can be used to control the time-separation of the avoided crossings, and
hence the character of the interference. Constructive and destructive
interference are possible. The interference effects are a consequence of the
temporal phase coherence of the wavefunction. The ability to vary this
coherence by varying the temporal separation of the avoided crossings renders
twisted rapid passage with adjustable twist strength into a temporal
interferometer through which qubit transitions can be greatly enhanced or
suppressed. Possible application of this interference mechanism to construction
of fast fault-tolerant quantum CNOT and NOT gates is discussed.

theoretical investigations on quantum dots and neutral atoms in microtraps as
tools for quantum information processing. We present analogies between
distinguishable particles, bosons and fermions in low-dimensional Hilbert
spaces. We introduce the notion of Slater rank for pure states of pairs of
fermions and bosons in analogy to the Schmidt rank for pairs of distinguishable

correlation measure for indistinguishable particles. Then we generalize these
notions to pure fermionic and bosonic states in higher-dimensional Hilbert
spaces and also to the multi-particle case. We review the results on quantum
correlations in mixed fermionic states and discuss the concept of fermionic
Slater witnesses. Then the theory of quantum correlations in mixed bosonic

methods of constructing optimal Slater witnesses that detect the degree of

  Destructive Interference In Four-wave Mixing</title><description>  We investigate a four-state system interacting with long and short laser
pulses in a weak probe beam approximation. We show that when all lasers are
tuned to the exact unperturbed resonances, part of the four-wave mixing (FWM)
field is strongly absorbed. The part which is not absorbed has the exact
intensity required to destructively interfere with the excitation pathway
involved in producing the FWM state. We show that with this three-photon
destructive interference, the conversion efficiency can still be as high as
25%. Contrary to common belief,our calculation shows that this process, where
an ideal one-photon electromagnetically induced transparency is established, is
not most suitable for high efficiency conversion. With appropriate
phase-matching and propagation distance, and when the three-photon destructive
interference does not occur, we show that the photon flux conversion efficiency
is independent of probe intensity and can be close to 100%. In addition, we
show clearly that the conversion efficiency is not determined by the maximum
atomic coherence between two lower excited states, as commonly believed. It is
the combination of phase-matching and constructive interference involving the
two terms arising in producing the mixing wave that is the key element for the
optimized FWM generation. Indeed, in this scheme no appreciable excited state
is produced, so that the atomic coherence between states |0&gt; and |2&gt; is always
very small.

transfer could be achieved by the amplitude- and frequency-modulation
quasi-adiabatic excitation (90 degree) pulses, while it is usually difficult
for the adiabatic inversion pulses to achieve effectively broadband
Hartmann-Hahn transfer in a heteronuclear coupled two-spin system. The
adiabatic and quasi-adiabatic pulses have an important property that within
their activation bandwidth flip angle of the pulses is independent of the pulse
duration and the bandwidth increases as the pulse duration. This property is
importanr for construction of the heteronuclear Hartmann-Hahn transfer
sequences with the quasi-adiabatic 90 degree pulses. Theoretic analysis and
numerical simulation show that the heteronuclear Hartmann-Hahn transfer is
performed in the even-order multiple- quantum operator algebra subspace of the

``which-way'' experiment, caused by an environmental interaction, may be viewed
as the destruction of first-order coherence as defined by Glauber many years
ago (Glauber). However, the influence of an environment can also destroy the
$n$th-order quantum coherence in a quantum system, where this high order
coherence is captured. We refer to this phenomenon as the $n$% th-order
decoherence. In this paper we show that, just as the first-order coherence can
be understood as the interference of the amplitudes for two distinct paths, the
higher order coherence may be understood as the interference of multiple
amplitudes corresponding to multiple paths. To see this, we introduce the
concept of $n$th-order ``multi-particle wave amplitude''. It turns out that the
$n$th-order correlation function can be expressed as the square norm of some
``multi-particle wave amplitude'' for the closed system or as the sum of such
square norms for the open system. We also examine, as a specific example, how
an environment can destroy the second order coherence by eliminating the
interference between various multiple paths.

quantum mechanical wave-equation describing free spinning particles --which we
propose to call &quot;Pseudotachyons&quot; (PT's)-- which behave like tachyons in the
momentum space, but like subluminal particles (v&lt;c) in the ordinary space. This
is allowed since, as it happens in every quantum theory for spin-1/2 particles,
the momentum operator (that is conserved) and the velocity operator (that is
not) are independent operators, which refer to independent quantities. As a
consequence, at variance with ordinary Dirac particles, for PT's the average
velocity is not equal to the classical velocity, but actually to the velocity
&quot;dual&quot; of the classical velocity. The speed of PT's is therefore smaller than
the speed of light. Since a lot of experimental data seems to involve a
negative mass squared for neutrinos, we suggest that these particles might be
PT's, travelling, because of their very small mass, at subluminal speeds very
close to c. The present theory is shown to be separately invariant under the C,
P, T transformations; the covariance under Lorentz transformations is also
proved. Furthermore, we derive the kinematical constraints linking 4-impulse,

scattering of an electron off a complex square barrier. As is well known the
(negative) imaginary part of the potential takes into account,
phenomenologically, the absorption. We investigate the so-called
Hartman-Fletcher effect, and find that it is suppressed by the presence of a
(not negligible) imaginary potential. In fact, when a sufficiently large
absorption is present, the asymptotical transmission speed is finite. Actually,
the tunnelling time does increase linearly with the barrier width. A recent
optical experiment seems to be in agreement with our theoretical previsions.

  orthosupersymmetries, reducibility, and bosonization</title><description>  Pseudosupersymmetric quantum mechanics (PsSSQM), based upon the use of
pseudofermions, was introduced in the context of a new Kemmer equation
describing charged vector mesons interacting with an external constant magnetic
field. Here we construct the complete explicit solution for its realization in
terms of two superpotentials, both equal or unequal. We prove that any
orthosupersymmetric quantum mechanical system has a pseudosupersymmetry and
give conditions under which a pseudosupersymmetric one may be described by
orthosupersymmetries of order two. We propose two new matrix realizations of
PsSSQM in terms of the generators of a generalized deformed oscillator algebra
(GDOA) and relate them to the cases of equal or unequal superpotentials,
respectively. We demonstrate that these matrix realizations are fully reducible
and that their irreducible components provide two distinct sets of bosonized
operators realizing PsSSQM and corresponding to nonlinear spectra. We relate
such results to some previous ones obtained for a GDOA connected with a
$C_3$-extended oscillator algebra (where $C_3 = {\rm Z}_3$) in the case of
linear spectra.

The result obtained is universal for arbitrary entangled two-qubit states and
it discloses that the corresponding local filter is not unique for density

pure state, MRE is found by the requirement that MRE is equal to EF. For a
mixed state, MRE is calculated by defining a total relative density matrix. We
obtain an explicit and &quot;weak&quot; closed expressions of MRE that depends on the
pure state decompositions for two qubit systems and give out an algorithm to
calculate MRE in principle for more qubit systems. MRE significantly improves
the computability of RE, decreases the sensitivity on the pure state
decompositions in EF, reveals the particular difference of similar departure
states from Bell's state and restore the logarithmic dependence on probability
of component states consistent with information theory. As examples, we
calculate MRE of the mixture of Bell's states and departure states from Bell's
states, and compare them with EF as well as Wootters' EF. Moreover we study the
important properties of MRE including the behavior under local general
measurement (LGM) and classical communication (CC).

feedback to realize the whole class of field-quadrature quantum nondemolition
measurements, from Von Neumann projective measurement to fully non-destructive
non-informative one. In our setup, the signal under investigation is mixed with
a squeezed probe in an interferometer and, at the output, one of the two modes
is revealed through homodyne detection. The second beam is then
amplitude-modulated according to the outcome of the measurement, and finally
squeezed according to the transmittivity of the interferometer. Using strongly
squeezed or anti-squeezed probes respectively, one achieves either a projective
measurement, i.e. homodyne statistics arbitrarily close to the intrinsic
quadrature distribution of the signal, and conditional outputs approaching the
corresponding eigenstates, or fully non-destructive one, characterized by an
almost uniform homodyne statistics, and by an output state arbitrarily close to
the input signal. By varying the squeezing between these two extremes, or
simply by tuning the internal phase-shift of the interferometer, the whole set
of intermediate cases can also be obtained. In particular, an optimal quantum
nondemolition measurement of quadrature can be achieved, which minimizes the
information gain versus state disturbance trade-off.

be regarded as a modification of an idea proposed by Inoue, Waks and Yamamoto
(IWY) [1]. The scheme described here uses a single phase modulator and two
differential delay elements in series at the transmitter that form an
interferometer when combined with a third differential delay element at the
receiver. The protocol is characterized by a high efficiency, reduced exposure
to an attack by an eavesdropper, and higher sensitivity to such an attack when
compared to other QKD schemes. For example, the efficiency with which
transmitted data contribute to the private key is 3/4 compared with 1/4 for
BB84 [2]. Moreover, an eavesdropper can aquire a maximum of 1/3 of the key
which leads to an error probability in the private key of 1/3. This can be
compared to 1/2 and 1/4 for these same parameters in both BB84 and IWY. The
combination of these considerations should lead to increased range and key
distribution rate over present fiber-based QKD schemes.

digit with a quantum digit (qudit) assigned to each classical state. The shape
of the memory is the vector of sizes of these qudits, which may differ. We
determine when N copies of a quantum memory A embed in N(1+o(1)) copies of
another quantum memory B. This relationship captures the notion that B is as at
least as useful as A for all purposes in the bulk limit. We show that the
embeddings exist if and only if for all p &gt;= 1, the p-norm of the shape of A
does not exceed the p-norm of the shape of B. The log of the p-norm of the
shape of A can be interpreted as the maximum of S(\rho) + H(\rho)/p (quantum
entropy plus discounted classical entropy) taken over all mixed states \rho on
A. We also establish a noiseless coding theorem that justifies these entropies.
The noiseless coding theorem and the bulk embedding theorem together say that
either A blindly bulk-encodes into B with perfect fidelity, or A admits a state
that does not visibly bulk-encode into B with high fidelity.
  In conclusion, the utility of a hybrid quantum memory is determined by its
simultaneous capacity for classical and quantum entropy, which is not a finite
list of numbers, but rather a convex region in the classical-quantum entropy
plane.

necessarily Hermitian) Hamiltonians with discrete spectra and real or
complex-conjugate pairs of eigenvalues are isospectral and have identical
degeneracy structure except perhaps for the zero eigenvalue if and only if they

the basic framework for generating non-Hermitian PT-symmetric and
non-PT-symmetric Hamiltonians with a real spectrum via a Darboux
transformation, and shows that every diagonalizable Hamiltonian H with a
discrete spectrum and real or complex-conjugate pairs of eigenvalues may be
factored as H=L^# L where L is a linear operator with pseudo-adjoint L^#. In
particular, this factorization applies to PT-symmetric and Hermitian
Hamiltonians. The nondegenerate two-level systems provide a class of
Hamiltonians that are pseudo-Hermitian. We demonstrate the implications of our

holomorphic, nevertheless satisfy generalized Cauchy-Riemann conditions
involving the U(1) Berry-Simon connection on the parameter space. These
conditions entail invertible relations between the gradients of the phase and
modulo, therefore allowing for the reconstruction of the phase from the modulo

of the amplitude. As a special case, we consider amplitude functions valued on
the space of pure states, the ray space ${\cal R} = {\mathbb C}P^n$, where
transition probabilities have a geometric interpretation in terms of geodesic
distances as measured with the Fubini-Study metric. In conjunction with the
generalized Cauchy-Riemann conditions, this geodesic interpretation leads to
additional relations, in particular a novel connection between the modulus of
the amplitude and the phase gradient, somewhat reminiscent of the WKB formula.
Finally, a connection with geometric phases is established.

`fragile' if its decoherence rate is anomalously great, and `stable against
LMs' if the result of a LM is not affected by another LM at a distant point. By
making full use of the locality and huge degrees of freedom, we show the
following: (i) If square fluctuation of every additive operator is O(V) or less
for a pure state, then it is not fragile in any WCNs or WPEs. (ii) If square

of a magnet $\RM$ formed by a set of $N\gg 1$ spins with quartic infinite-range
Ising interactions, and a phonon bath $\RB$ at temperature $T$. Initially A is
in a metastable paramagnetic phase. The process involves several time-scales.
Without being much affected, A first acts on S, whose state collapses in a very
brief time. The mechanism differs from the usual decoherence. Soon after its
irreversibility is achieved. Finally the field induced by S on M, which may
take two opposite values with probabilities given by Born's rule, drives A into
its up or down ferromagnetic phase. The overall final state involves the
expected correlations between the result registered in M and the state of S.
The measurement is thus accounted for by standard quantum statistical mechanics
and its specific features arise from the macroscopic size of the apparatus.

random walks, called quantum multibaker maps (QMB). These are Weyl
quantizations of the classical multibaker models previously considered by
Gaspard, Tasaki and others. Depending on the properties of the phases
parametrizing the quantization, we consider only two classes of the QMB maps:
uniform and random. Uniform QMB maps are characterized by phases which are the
same in every unit cell of the multibaker chain. Random QMB maps have phases
that vary randomly from unit cell to unit cell. The eigenstates in the former
case are extended while in the latter they are localized. In the uniform case
and for large $\hbar$, analytic solutions can be obtained for the time
dependent quantum states for periodic chains and for open chains with absorbing
boundary conditions. Steady state solutions and the properties of the
relaxation to a steady state for a uniform QMB chain in contact with
``particle'' reservoirs can also be described analytically. The analytical
results are consistent with, and confirmed by, results obtained from numerical
methods. We report here results for the deep quantum regime (large $\hbar$) of
the uniform QMB, as well as some results for the random QMB. We leave the
moderate and small $\hbar$ results as well as further consideration of the
other versions of the QMB for further publications.

  three coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title><description>  The dynamics of three coupled bosonic wells (trimer) containing $N$ bosons is
investigated within a standard (mean-field) semiclassical picture based on the
coherent-state method. Various periodic solutions (configured as $\pi$-like,
dimerlike and vortex states) representing collective modes are obtained
analitically when the fixed points of trimer dynamics are identified on the
$N$=const submanifold in the phase space. Hyperbolic, maximum and minimum
points are recognized in the fixed-point set by studying the Hessian signature
of the trimer Hamiltonian.
  The system dynamics in the neighbourhood of periodic orbits (associated to
fixed points) is studied via numeric integration of trimer motion equations
thus revealing a diffused chaotic behavior (not excluding the presence of
regular orbits), macroscopic effects of population-inversion and self-trapping.
In particular, the behavior of orbits with initial conditions close to the
dimerlike periodic orbits shows how the self-trapping effect of dimerlike
integrable subregimes is destroyed by the presence of chaos.

the Feshbach projector technique we quantize the field in terms of a set of

to the system--and--bath Hamiltonian of quantum optics. The field dynamics is
investigated using the input--output theory of Gardiner and Collet. In the case
of strong coupling to the external radiation field we find spectrally
overlapping resonator modes. The mode dynamics is coupled due to the damping

dynamics is determined by a non--Hermitean random matrix. Upon including an
amplifying medium, our dynamics of open-resonator modes may serve as a starting

  methods</title><description>  This work is an enquiry into the circumstances under which entropy methods
can give an answer to the questions of both quantum separability and classical
correlations of a composite state. Several entropy functionals are employed to
examine the entanglement and correlation properties guided by the corresponding
calculations of concurrence. It is shown that the entropy difference between
that of the composite and its marginal density matrices may be of arbitrary
sign except under special circumstances when conditional probability can be
defined appropriately. This ambiguity is a consequence of the fact that the
overlap matrix elements of the eigenstates of the composite density matrix with
those of its marginal density matrices also play important roles in the
definitions of probabilities and the associated entropies, along with their
respective eigenvalues. The general results are illustrated using pure and
mixed state density matrices of two-qubit systems. Two classes of density
matrices are found for which the conditional probability can defined: (1)
density matrices with commuting decompositions and (2) those which are
decohered in the representation where the density matrices of the marginals are
diagonal. The first class of states encompass those whose separability is
currently understood as due to particular symmetries of the states. The second
are a new class of states which are expected to be useful for understanding
separability. Examples of entropy functionals of these decohered states
including the crucial isospectral case are discussed.

compare the periodic orbit expansion technique with Lagrange's inversion

according to physically obvious rules. In addition our periodic orbit

examples of quantum mechanics that previously could only be solved using

  We show that, even without the assumption of an eigenvalue gap, other
standard arguments can be used to show that a large class of Hamiltonians

  We also discuss some of the issues which arise in trying to analyze the

which provide, at the classical level, the same equation of motion as the
conventional Hamiltonian. These Hamiltonians, say $K_{1}$ and $K_{2}$, result
to be explicitly time-dependent and can be expressed as a formal rotation of
two cubic polynomial functions, $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$, of the canonical variables
(q,p).
  We investigate the role of these fouled Hamiltonians at the quantum level.
Adopting a canonical quantization procedure, we construct some quantum models
and analyze the related eigenvalue equations. One of these models is described
by a Hamiltonian admitting infinite self-adjoint extensions, each of them has a
discrete spectrum on the real line. A self-adjoint extension is fixed by
choosing the spectral parameter $\epsilon$ of the associated eigenvalue
equation equal to zero. The spectral problem is discussed in the context of
three different representations. For $\epsilon =0$, the eigenvalue equation is
exactly solved in all these representations, in which square-integrable
solutions are explicity found. A set of constants of motion corresponding to
these quantum models is also obtained. Furthermore, the algebraic structure
underlying the quantum models is explored. This turns out to be a nonlinear
(quadratic) algebra, which could be applied for the determination of
approximate solutions to the eigenvalue equations.

  for a quantum mechanics in a gravitational field</title><description>  According to Schroedinger's ideas, classical dynamics of point particles
should correspond to the &quot; geometrical optics &quot; limit of a linear wave
equation, in the same way as ray optics is the limit of wave optics. It is
shown that, using notions of modern wave theory, the &quot; geometrical optics &quot;
analogy leads to the correspondence between a classical Hamiltonian H and a &quot;
quantum &quot; wave equation in a natural and general way. In particular, the
correspondence is unambiguous also in the case where H contains mixed terms
involving momentum and position. In the line of Schroedinger's ideas, it is
also attempted to justify the occurrence, in QM, of eigenvalues problems, not
merely for energy, but also for momentum. It is shown that the wave functions
of pure momentum states can be defined in a physically more satisfying way than
by assuming plane waves. In the case of a spatially uniform force field, such
momentum states have a singularity and move undeformed according to Newton's
second law. The mentioned unambiguous correspondence allows to uniquely extend
the Klein-Gordon relativistic wave equation to the case where a constant
gravitational field is present. It is argued that Schroedinger's wave mechanics
can be extended to the case with a variable gravitational field only if one
accepts that the wave equation is a preferred-frame one. From this viewpoint,
generally-covariant extensions of the wave equations of QM seem rather formal.
Finally, it is conjectured that there is no need for a quantum gravity.

corresponds to the setup of a recently performed experiment [J. Eschner
\textit{et. al.}, Nature \textbf{413}, 495 (2001)] where the influence of a
mirror on a fluorescing single atom was revealed. In the present work special
attention is paid to a regime of large atom-mirror distances where intrinsic
memory effects cannot be neglected anymore. This is done with the help of delay
differential equations which contain, for small atom-mirror distances, the
Markovian limit with effective level shifts and decay rates leading to the
phenomenon of enhancement or inhibition of spontaneous decay. Several features
are recovered beyond an effective Markovian treatment, appearing in
experimental accessible quantities like intensity or emission spectra of the
scattered light.

of coordinates makes it possible to write the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation only
using annihilation and creation operators of four harmonic oscillators, coupled
by various terms of degree up to twelve. We analyse in details the discrete
symmetry properties of the eigenstates. The energy levels and eigenstates of
the two-dimensional helium atom are obtained numerically, by expanding the
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation on a convenient basis set, that gives sparse banded

give some very accurate values of the energy levels of the first bound Rydberg

ionization threshold. For the two-dimensional $H^{-}$ ion, only one bound state

Alternatively, there are nonlinear dynamical extensions that treat mixed states
as {\it elementary mixtures} and evolve {\it every}pure state linearly and
unitarily. But if all {\it entangled} pure states evolve linearly, then
elementary mixtures cannot evolve nonlinearly without challenging quantum
locality. Conversely, any such extension that is relativistically well behaved
demands a nonlinear evolution [decoherence] of pure entangled states. Wherefrom
follows that the linear evolution of entangled pure states provides an
unequivocal signature of linear quantum dynamics.

  measurements</title><description>  We show that the so-called quantum probabilistic rule, usually presented in
the physical literature as an argument of the essential distinction between the
probability relations under quantum and classical measurements, is not, as it
is usually considered, in contrast to the rule for the addition of
probabilities of incompatible events. The latter is, of course, valid under all
measurement situations upon classical and quantum objects. We discuss also
quantum measurement situation, which is similar to the classical one,
corresponding to classical Bayes' formula for conditional probabilities. We
show the compatibility of description of this quantum measurement situation in
the frame of purely classical and experimentally justified straight ward
frequency arguments [Khrennikov (1999, 2000, 2001)] and in the frame of the
quantum stochastic approach to the description of generalized quantum
measurements (Loubenets (2000); Barndorff-Nielsen and Loubenets (2001)]. In
view of derived results, we argue that even in the classical probability the
classical Bayes' formula describes a particular case of the considered
measurement situation, which is specific for context-independent measurements.
The similarity of the forms of the relation between the transformation of
probabilities, which we derive in the frame of quantum stochastic approach and
in the frame of straight ward frequency arguments, underlines once more that
the projective (von Neumann) measurements correspond only to a very special
kind of measurement situations in quantum theory.

related to a preferred frame. A Dirac-type equation for spacelike neutrinos is

provides controlled coupling between dots, and enables single electron
occupation of each dot. Precise modeling of the design elucidates its potential

cycles. In a quasi-ordered set Q, cycles are allowed. In this paper, we
consider a subset QC of a quasi-ordered set Q, whose elements are all the
cycles. In QC, which is endowed with quantum logic, each cycle of maximal
outdegree N in a node, is associated with N entangled qubits. Then QC describes
a quantum computing spacetime. This structure, which is non-local and
non-casual, can be understood as a proto-spacetime. Micro-causality and
locality can be restored in the subset U of Q whose elements are unentangled
qubits which we interpret as the states of quantum spacetime. The mapping of
quantum spacetime into proto-spacetime is given by the action of the XOR gate.
Moreover, a mapping is possible from the Boolean causal set into U by the
action of the Hadamard gate. In particular, the causal order defined on the
elements of U induces the causal evolution of spin networks.

while preserving universality. The simplest encoding uses two physical qubits
per logical qubit. Two architectures for its implementation are proposed: one
employing N physical qubits out of which N/2 are ancillas fixed in the |1&gt;
state, the other employing N/2+1 physical qubits, one of which is a bus qubit
connected to all others. Details of a minimal set of universal encoded logic
operations are given, together with recoupling schemes, that require nanosecond

per physical qubits is presented. Compatible decoherence and noise suppression

laws contains two mutually exclusive values: attachment space attaching to
object and detachment space detaching from object. However, the cosmic physical
system could not start with mutually exclusive attachment space and detachment
space at the same time in the beginning. The way out of this impasse is that
the complete cosmic system consists of both the cosmic physical system and the
unphysical cosmic digital code. The unphysical cosmic digital code allows the
coexistence of attachment space and detachment space at the same time. The
cosmic digital code behaves as gene in organism, and the cosmic physical system
behaves as organ. Under different conditions and times, different spaces in the
cosmic digital code are activated to generate different spaces in the cosmic
physical systems with different physical laws for different universes in the
multivese. All universes start from the primitive multiverse, which only has
attachment space attaching to 10D string without the four force fields. During
the big bang in our universe, detachment space emerged to detach particle from
its four force fields. Such detachment, however, cannot be completely and
permanently detached, because particle still attaches to its force fields. The
result is hybrid space, combining both attachment space and detachment space in
coherent state, such as particle and its force fields. Hybrid space is the
space for wavefunction whose probability density is proportional to attachment
space, and inversely proportional to detachment space. The collapse of
wavefunction in decoherent state is the separation of attachment space and
detachment space in such way that attachment space attaches to particle, and
detachment space separately detaches from all probability density.

or, more formally, the minimal resources per signal required to represent
arbitrarily long strings of signals with arbitrarily high fidelity, when the
compressor is given the identity of the input state sequence as classical
information. According to the quantum source coding theorem, the optimal
quantum rate is the von Neumann entropy S(E) qubits per signal.
  We develop a refinement of this theorem in order to analyze the situation in
which the states are coded into classical and quantum bits that are quantified
separately. This leads to a trade--off curve Q(R), where Q(R) qubits per signal
is the optimal quantum rate for a given classical rate of R bits per signal.
  Our main result is an explicit characterization of this trade--off function
by a simple formula in terms of only single signal, perfect fidelity encodings
of the source. We give a thorough discussion of many further mathematical
properties of our formula, including an analysis of its behavior for group
covariant sources and a generalization to sources with continuously
parameterized states. We also show that our result leads to a number of
corollaries characterizing the trade--off between information gain and state
disturbance for quantum sources. In addition, we indicate how our techniques
also provide a solution to the so--called remote state preparation problem.
Finally, we develop a probability--free version of our main result which may be
interpreted as an answer to the question: ``How many classical bits does a
qubit cost?'' This theorem provides a type of dual to Holevo's theorem, insofar
as the latter characterizes the cost of coding classical bits into qubits.

This letter focuses on the issue of optical interference, and shows that at
least one brane-world model can offer plausible interpretations for both
Young's double-slit experiment, and the experiments that fit less neatly with
it. The basic assumption is that particles can interact at a distance through
the vibrations induced by their motion on the brane. The qualitative analysis
of this mechanism suggests that fringe visibility in single photon interference
depends on the energy levels and the interval between interacting particles. A
double-slit experiment, performed with coherent single red photons should
reveal the disappearance of interference when the time delay between individual
particles is increased over 2.18 seconds. In the case of infrared photons with
the frequency of $9\cdot 10^{13}$ Hz, interference must vanish already at the
interval of one second.

entanglement is a function of the relative momentum wavefunction of the Cooper
pair, and is thus directly related to the superconducting energy gap. For a
spinless Bose system, entanglement does not appear in the
Hatree-Gross-Pitaevskii approximation, but becomes important in the Bogoliubov

pair-breaking or non-pair-breaking in analogy with magnetic or non-magnetic

the model is a polariton condensate with a gap in the excitation spectrum.
Increase of the pair-breaking parameter $\gamma$ reduces the gap, which becomes
zero at a critical value $\gamma_{C1}$; for large $\gamma$, the conventional

  Formation during the Cosmological Phase Transitions</title><description>  Search for the mechanisms suppressing formation of Higgs field defects (e.g.
domain walls) during the cosmological phase transitions is one of key problems
in explanation of the observed large-scale uniformity of the space-time. One of
the possible solutions can be based on accounting for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen
(EPR) correlations. Namely, if a coherent quantum state of the Higgs field was
formed in the course of its previous evolution, then reduction to the state
with broken symmetry during the phase transition should be correlated even at
the scales exceeding the local cosmological horizons. Detailed consideration of
the simplest one-dimensional cosmological model with Z2 Higgs field
demonstrates that, at certain parameters of the Lagrangian, EPR-correlations
really result in a substantial suppression of spontaneous formation of the

developed, which opened up new possibilities in the field. These methods are
briefly reviewed. Substantial progress in the field has been made by the
introduction of Light-Induced Drift as a gas-phase separation tool. This is
illustrated by extensive data on CH3F, which reveal that the gas-phase
ortho-para conversion is governed by intramolecular mixing of the nuclear spin

Various aspects of the conversion were investigated in detail: pressure and
collision partner dependence, isotope effect, temperature dependence. The most

atom coupled to a light field. The evolution of this system is governed by a
master equation. The irreversible components of this master equation describe
the spontaneous emission of photons from the atom. For many applications, it is
necessary to minimize the effect of this irreversible evolution. This can be
achieved by having a far detuned light field. The drawback of this regime is
that making the detuning very large makes the timestep required to solve the
master equation very small, much smaller than the timescale of any significant
evolution. This makes the problem very numerically intensive. For this reason,
approximations are used to simulate the master equation which are more
numerically tractable to solve. This paper analyses four approximations: The
standard adiabatic approximation; a more sophisticated adiabatic approximation
(not used before); a secular approximation; and a fully quantum dressed-state
approximation. The advantages and disadvantages of each are investigated with
respect to accuracy, complexity and the resources required to simulate. In a
parameter regime of particular experimental interest, only the sophisticated
adiabatic and dressed-state approximations agree well with the exact evolution.

the wave function as a description of (thus nonlocal) physical reality. The

  We then apply the method to the determination of the communication cost of
asymptotic entanglement concentration and dilution. While concentration is
known to require no communication whatsoever, the best known protocol for
dilution, discovered by Lo and Popescu [Phys. Rev. Lett. 83(7):1459--1462,
1999], requires a number of bits to be exchanged which is of the order of the
square root of the number of EPR pairs. Here we prove a matching lower bound of
the same asymptotic order, demonstrating the optimality of the Lo-Popescu
protocol up to a constant factor and establishing the existence of a
fundamental asymmetry between the concentration and dilution tasks.
  We also discuss states for which the minimal communication cost is
proportional to their entanglement, such as the states recently introduced in
the context of ``embezzling entanglement'' [W. van Dam and P. Hayden,
quant-ph/0201041].

complexity of distributed problems. Specifically, we consider the amount of
communication that is required to transform a bipartite state into another,
typically more entangled, state. We obtain lower bounds in this setting by
studying the Renyi entropy of the marginal density matrices of the distributed
system.
  The communication bounds on quantum state transformations also imply lower
bounds for the model of communication complexity where the task consists of the
the distributed evaluation of a function f(x,y). Our approach encapsulates
several known lower bound methods that use the log-rank or the von Neumann
entropy of the density matrices involved. The technique is also effective for
proving lower bounds on problems involving a promise or for which the &quot;hard&quot;
distributions of inputs are correlated. As examples, we show how to prove a
nearly tight bound on the bounded-error quantum communication complexity of the
inner product function in the presence of unlimited amounts of EPR-type
entanglement and a similarly strong bound on the complexity of the shifted
quadratic character problem.

atomistic ortho-lattice (cao-lattice) L. It is known that since the two systems
are independent, no Hilbert space description is possible, i.e. $L\ne P(H)$,
the lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space (theorem 1). We impose five
conditions on L. Four of them are shown to be physically necessary. The last
one relates the orthogonality between states in each system to the
ortho-complementation of L. It can be justified if one assumes that the
orthogonality between states in the total system induces the
ortho-complementation of L. We prove that if L satisfies these five conditions,
then L is the separated product proposed by Aerts in 1982 to describe
independent quantum systems (theorem 2). Finally, we give strong arguments to
exclude the separated product and therefore our last condition. As a
consequence, we ask whether among the ca-lattices that satisfy our first four
basic necessary conditions, there exists an ortho-complemented one different
from the separated product.

modified by two hypotheses: state vector reduction is a well-defined process,
and strict local causality applies. The first of these holds in some versions
of Copenhagen quantum theory and need not necessarily imply practically
testable deviations from ordinary quantum theory. The second implies that
measurement events which are spacelike separated have no non-local
correlations. To test this prediction, which sharply differs from standard
quantum theory, requires a precise theory of state vector reduction.
  Formally speaking, any precise version of causal quantum theory defines a
local hidden variable theory. However, causal quantum theory is most naturally
seen as a variant of standard quantum theory. For that reason it seems a more
serious rival to standard quantum theory than local hidden variable models
relying on the locality or detector efficiency loopholes.
  Some plausible versions of causal quantum theory are not refuted by any Bell
experiments to date, nor is it obvious that they are inconsistent with other
experiments. They evade refutation via a neglected loophole in Bell experiments
-- the {\it collapse locality loophole} -- which exists because of the possible
time lag between a particle entering a measuring device and a collapse taking
place. Fairly definitive tests of causal versus standard quantum theory could
be made by observing entangled particles separated by $\approx 0.1$ light
seconds.

measurements on entangled systems are correlated in a way that cannot be
reproduced by local hidden variables, they cannot be used for superluminal
signalling. As Czachor, Gisin and Polchinski pointed out, this is not true for
general nonlinear modifications of the Schroedinger equation. Excluding
superluminal signalling has thus been taken to rule out most nonlinear versions
of quantum theory. The no superluminal signalling constraint has also been used
for alternative derivations of the optimal fidelities attainable for imperfect
quantum cloning and other operations.
  These results apply to theories satisfying the rule that their predictions
for widely separated and slowly moving entangled systems can be approximated by
non-relativistic equations of motion with respect to a preferred time
coordinate. This paper describes a natural way in which this rule might fail to
hold. In particular, it is shown that quantum readout devices which display the
values of localised pure states need not allow superluminal signalling,
provided that the devices display the values of the states of entangled
subsystems as defined in a non-standard, but natural, way. It follows that any
locally defined nonlinear evolution of pure states can be made consistent with
Minkowski causality.

still interacts with the measured system to form a triple entanglement among

  The picture of quantum mechanics that emerges is conceptually close to that
of a geometric manifold covered by local coordinate charts. Instead of the
latter, quantum mechanics has local coherent states. A change of coordinates on
${\cal C}$ may or may not be holomorphic. Correspondingly, a transformation
between quantum-mechanical states may or may not preserve coherence. Those that
do not preserve coherence are duality transformations. A duality appears as the
possibility of giving two or more, apparently different, descriptions of the
same quantum-mechanical phenomenon. Coherence becomes a local property on
classical phase space. Observers on ${\cal C}$ not connected by means of a
holomorphic change of coordinates need not, and in general will not, agree on
what is a semiclassical effect vs. what is a strong quantum effect

mixtures in the limit in which that process is much faster than any competing
one generated by the Hamiltonian $H_{\rm sys}$ of the isolated system. This
interaction dominated decoherence limit has previously not found much attention
even though it is of importance for the emergence of classical behavior in the
macroworld, since it will always be the relevant regime for large enough
separations between superposed wave packets. The usual golden-rule treatment
then does not apply but we can employ a short-time expansion for the free
motion while keeping the interaction $H_{\rm int}$ in full. We thus reveal
decoherence as a universal short-time phenomenon largely independent of the
character of the system as well as the bath. Simple analytical expressions for
the decoherence time scales are obtained in the limit in which decoherence is
even faster than any timescale emerging from the reservoir Hamiltonian $H_{\rm

We show that a relatively very small number of nonmonochromatic modes can be

reproduce the experimental data of photon number correlations in optical
solitons [S. Spalter et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 786 (1998)]. This approach is
very useful for a detailed understanding of squeezing properties of soliton

  Computation</title><description>  One of the main requirements in linear optics quantum computing is the
ability to perform single-qubit operations that are controlled by classical
information fed forward from the output of single photon detectors. These
operations correspond to pre-determined combinations of phase corrections and
bit-flips that are applied to the post-selected output modes of
non-deterministic quantum logic devices. Corrections of this kind are required
in order to obtain the correct logical output for certain detection events, and
their use can increase the overall success probability of the devices. In this
paper, we report on the experimental demonstration of the use of this type of
feed-forward system to increase the probability of success of a simple
non-deterministic quantum logic operation from approximately 1/4 to 1/2. This
logic operation involves the use of one target qubit and one ancilla qubit
which, in this experiment, are derived from a parametric down-conversion photon
pair. Classical information describing the detection of the ancilla photon is
fed-forward in real-time and used to alter the quantum state of the output
photon. A fiber optic delay line is used to store the output photon until a
polarization-dependent phase shift can be applied using a high speed Pockels
cell.

the Rains bound is convex and continuous; (ii) under some weak assumption, the

The classical dynamics of two--dimensional area--preserving maps on the torus

of area--preserving maps given by their generating function is discussed and
for the computation of the eigenvalues a computer program in Python is
presented. We illustrate the eigenvalue distribution for two types of perturbed
cat maps, one leading to COE and the other to CUE statistics. For the
eigenfunctions of quantum maps we study the distribution of the eigenvectors
and compare them with the corresponding random matrix distributions. The Husimi
representation allows for a direct comparison of the localization of the
eigenstates in phase space with the corresponding classical structures.
Examples for a perturbed cat map and the standard map with different parameters
are shown. Billiard systems and the corresponding quantum billiards are another
important class of systems (which are also relevant to applications, for
example in mesoscopic physics). We provide a detailed exposition of the
boundary integral method, which is one important method to determine the
eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Helmholtz equation. We discuss several
methods to determine the eigenvalues from the Fredholm equation and illustrate
them for the stadium billiard. The occurrence of spurious solutions is
discussed in detail and illustrated for the circular billiard, the stadium
billiard, and the annular sector billiard. We emphasize the role of the normal
derivative function to compute the normalization of eigenfunctions, momentum
representations or autocorrelation functions in a very efficient and direct
way. Some examples for these quantities are given and discussed.

described as the merging of the real line algebra with the anyonic line
algebra. Technically this merged structure is a smash algebra, namely an
algebra resulting by a braided tensoring of real with anyonic line algebras.
  The motivation of introducing the smashing results from the necessity of
having non commuting increments in the random walk. Based on the
observable-state duality provided by the underlying Hopf structure, the
construction is cast into two dual forms: one using functionals determined by
density probability functions and the other using the associated Markov
transition operator. The ensuing diffusion equation is shown to possess
triangular matrix realization.
  The study is completed by the incorporation of Hamiltonian dynamics in the
above random walk model, and by the construction of the dynamical equation
obeyed by statistical moments of the problem for generic entangled density
functions.

the largest balls, in spectral $l_p$ norms for $1 \le p \le \infty$, of
separable (unentangled) matrices around the identity matrix. This implies a
simple and intutively meaningful geometrical sufficient condition for
separability of bipartite density matrices: that their purity $\tr \rho^2$ not
be too large. Theoretical and experimental applications of these results

  quantization</title><description>  Geometric phases are well known in classical electromagnetism and quantum
mechanics since the early works of Pantcharatnam and Berry. Their origin relies
on the geometric nature of state spaces and has been studied in many different
systems such as spins, polarized light and atomic physics. Recent works have
explored their application in interferometry and quantum computation. Earlier
works suggest how to observe these phases in single quantum systems
adiabatically driven by external classical devices or sources, where, by
classical, we mean any system whose state does not change considerably during
the interaction time: an intense magnetic field interacting with a spin 1/2, or
a birefringent medium interacting with polarized light. Here we propose a
feasible experiment to investigate quantum effects in these phases, arising
when this classical source drives not a single quantum system, but two
interacting ones. In particular, we show how to observe a signature of field
quantization through a vacuum effect in Berry's phase. To do so, we describe
the interaction of an atom and a quantized cavity mode altogether driven by an
external quasi-classical field.

coherently pumped atom along the axis of a high--Q cavity is studied. The
internal dynamics of the atomic dipole strongly coupled to the cavity field is
treated by a non-perturbative quantum mechanical model, while the effect of the
cavity on the external motion is described classically in terms of the
analytically obtained linear friction and diffusion coefficients. Efficient
cavity-induced damping is found which leads to steady-state temperatures
well-below the Doppler limit. We reveal a mathematical symmetry between the
results here and for a similar system where, instead of the atom, the cavity
field is pumped. The cooling process is strongly enhanced in a degenerate
multimode cavity. Both the temperature and the number of scattered photons
during the characteristic cooling time exhibits a significant reduction with
increasing number of modes involved in the dynamics. The residual number of
spontaneous emissions in a cooling time for large mode degeneracy can reach and

follows from an additivity theorem for the capacity of the product of the

of quantum information processing by many recently-discovered schemes. All
these schemes are based on the interaction between optical beams and atomic
ensembles. For description of these interactions, one assumed either a
cavity-QED model or a one-dimensional light propagation model, which is still
inadequate for a full prediction and understanding of most of the current
experimental efforts which are actually taken in the three-dimensional free
space. Here, we propose a perturbative theory to describe the three-dimensional
effects in interaction between atomic ensembles and free-space light with a
level configuration important for several applications. The calculations reveal
some significant effects which are not known before from the other approaches,
such as the inherent mode-mismatching noise and the optimal mode-matching
conditions. The three-dimensional theory confirms the collective enhancement of
the signal-to-noise ratio which is believed to be one of the main advantage of
the ensemble-based quantum information processing schemes, however, it also
shows that this enhancement need to be understood in a more subtle way with an
appropriate mode matching method.

knowledge on teleported states. The teleportation protocol is said to be
oblivious to both parties. In remote state preparation (RSP) it is assumed that
Alice is given complete classical knowledge on the state that is to be prepared
by Bob. Recently, Leung and Shor showed that the same amount of classical
information as that in teleportation needs to be transmitted in any exact and
deterministic RSP protocol that is oblivious to Bob. We study similar RSP
protocols, but not necessarily oblivious to Bob. First it is shown that Bob's
quantum operation can be safely assumed to be a unitary transformation. We then
derive an equation that is a necessary and sufficient condition for such a
protocol to exist. By studying this equation, we show that one qubit RSP
requires 2 cbits of classical communication, which is the same amount as in
teleportation, even if the protocol is not assumed oblivious to Bob. For higher
dimensions, it is still open whether the amount of classical communication can
be reduced by abandoning oblivious conditions.

introduced in M. Czachor, J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. {\bf 33} (2000) 8081-8103. The
formalism is extended to the relativistic domain. The link to the standard
theory is obtained via a thermodynamic limit. Unitary representations of the
Poincar\'e group at the level of fields and states are explicitly given.
Non-canonical multi-photon and coherent states are introduced. In the
thermodynamic limit the statistics of photons in a coherent state is
Poissonian. The $S$ matrix of radiation fields produced by a classical current
is given by a non-canonical coherent-state displacement operator, a fact
automatically eliminating the infrared catastrophe. Field operators are shown
to be operators and not operator-valued distributions, and can be multiplied at
the same point in configuration space. An exactly solvable example is used to
compare predictions of the standard theory with those of non-canonical quantum
optics, and explicitly shows the mechanism of automatic ultraviolet
regularization occuring in the non-canonical theory. Similar conclusions are
obtained in perturbation theory, where one finds the standard Feynman diagrams,
but the Feynman rules are modified. A comparison with the Dicke-Hepp-Lieb model
allows to identify the physical structure behind the non-canonical algebra as
corresponding to an ensemble of indefinite-frequency oscillators with constant
density $N/V$.

attempts of circumventing certain assumptions leading to the Bell theorem
(Hess-Philipp, Accardi). If I correctly understand the intentions of these
Authors, the idea is to make use of the following logical loophole inherent in
the proof of the Bell theorem: Probabilities of counterfactual events A and A'
do not have to coincide with actually measured probabilities if measurements of
A and A' disturb each other, or for any other fundamental reason cannot be
performed simulaneously. It is generally believed that in the context of
classical probability theory (i.e. realistic hidden variables) probabilities of
counterfactual events can be identified with those of actually measured events.
In the paper I give an explicit counterexample to this belief. The &quot;first
variation&quot; on the Aerts model shows that counterfactual and actual problems
formulated for the same classical system may be unrelated. In the model the
first probability does not violate any classical inequality whereas the second
does. Pecularity of the Bell inequality is that on the basis of an in principle
unobservable probability one derives probabilities of jointly measurable random
variables, the fact additionally obscuring the logical meaning of the
construction. The existence of the loophole does not change the fact that I was
not able to construct a local model violating the inequality with all the other
loopholes eliminated.

inequalities, it is usually assumed that any hidden variables associated with
the nth particle pair would be independent of measurement choices and outcomes
for the first $(n-1)$ pairs. Models which violate this assumption exploit what
we call the {\it memory loophole}. We focus on the strongest type of violation,
which uses the {\it 2-sided} memory loophole, in which the hidden variables for
pair $n$ can depend on the previous measurement choices and outcomes in both
wings of the experiment. We show that the 2-sided memory loophole allows a
systematic violation of the CHSH inequality when the data are analysed in the
standard way, but cannot produce a violation if a CHSH expression depending
linearly on the data is used. In the first case, the maximal CHSH violation
becomes small as the number of particle pairs tested becomes large. Hence,
although in principle the memory loophole implies a slight flaw in existing
analyses of Bell experiments, the data still strongly confirm quantum mechanics
against local hidden variables.
  We consider also a related loophole, the {\it simultaneous measurement
loophole}, which applies if all measurements on each side are carried out
simultaneously. We show that this can increase the probability of violating the
linearised CHSH inequality as well as other Bell-type inequalities.

1939 paper on the Poincar\'e group. For a massive particle at rest, the little
group is O(3) from which the concept of spin emerges. The little group for a
massless particle is isomorphic to the two-dimensional Euclidean group with one
rotational and two translational degrees of freedom. The rotational degree
corresponds to the helicity, and the translational degrees to the gauge degree
of freedom. The question then is whether these two different symmetries can be
united. Another hard-pressing problem is Feynman's parton picture which is
valid only for hadrons moving with speed close to that of light. While the
hadron at rest is believed to be a bound state of quarks, the question arises
whether the parton picture is a Lorentz-boosted bound state of quarks. We study
these problems within Einstein's framework in which the energy-momentum
relations for slow particles and fast particles are two different
manifestations one covariant entity.

qubits interact with a common heat bath in thermal equilibrium, but do not
interact directly with each other. In most situations the entanglement is
created for a very short time after the interaction with the heat bath is
switched on, but depending on system, coupling, and heat bath, the entanglement
may persist for arbitrarily long times. This mechanism sheds new light on the
creation of entanglement. A particular example of two quantum dots in a closed

optimization problems, aiming at faster convergence to the optimal state. The
idea is tested by the two models, the transverse Ising model and the traveling
salesman problem (TSP). Adding the transverse field to the Ising model is a
simple way to introduce quantum fluctuations. The strength of the transverse
field is controlled as a function of time similarly to the temperature in the
conventional method. TSP can be described by the Ising spin, so that we also
apply the same technique to TSP. We directory solve the time-dependent
Schr\&quot;odinger equation for small-size systems and perform the quantum Monte
Carlo simulation for large-size systems. Comparison with the results of the
corresponding classical (thermal) method reveals that the quantum method leads
to the ground state with much larger probability in almost all cases if we use
the same annealing schedule of the control parameters. We also find that the
relaxation time is quite short for quantum systems by numerical simulations. We
consider this is one of the reasons why the annealing in quantum systems have a
better performance of finding the optimal state in comparison with classical
systems.

  Theory</title><description>  We have recently introduced a realistic, covariant, interpretation for the
reduction process in relativistic quantum mechanics. The basic problem for a
covariant description is the dependence of the states on the frame within which
collapse takes place. A suitable use of the causal structure of the devices
involved in the measurement process allowed us to introduce a covariant notion
for the collapse of quantum states. However, a fully consistent description in
the relativistic domain requires the extension of the interpretation to quantum
fields. The extension is far from straightforward. Besides the obvious
difficulty of dealing with the infinite degrees of freedom of the field theory,
one has to analyze the restrictions imposed by causality concerning the allowed
operations in a measurement process. In this paper we address these issues. We
shall show that, in the case of partial causally connected measurements, our
description allows us to include a wider class of causal operations than the
one resulting from the standard way for computing conditional probabilities.
This alternative description could be experimentally tested. A verification of
this proposal would give a stronger support to the realistic interpretations of
the states in quantum mechanics.

in a cavity suited for second-harmonic generation. The evanescent wave coupling
between the waveguides is considered as weak, and the interplay between this
coupling and the nonlinear interaction within the waveguides gives rise to
quantum violations of the classical limit. These violations are particularly
strong when two instabilities are competing, where twin-beam behavior is found
as almost complete noise suppression in the difference of the fundamental
intensities. Moreover, close to bistable transitions perfect twin-beam
correlations are seen in the sum of the fundamental intensities, and also the
self-pulsing instability as well as the transition from symmetric to asymmetric
states display nonclassical twin-beam correlations of both fundamental and
second-harmonic intensities. The results are based on the full quantum Langevin
equations derived from the Hamiltonian and including cavity damping effects.
The intensity correlations of the output fields are calculated
semi-analytically using a linearized version of the Langevin equations derived
through the positive-P representation. Confirmation of the analytical results
are obtained by numerical simulations of the nonlinear Langevin equations
derived using the truncated Wigner representation.

have produced a Mott insulating state of Rb atoms. This state is stable to a
small applied potential gradient (an `electric' field), but a resonant response
was observed when the potential energy drop per lattice spacing (E), was close
to the repulsive interaction energy (U) between two atoms in the same lattice
potential well. We identify all states which are resonantly coupled to the Mott
insulator for E close to U via an infinitesimal tunneling amplitude between
neighboring potential wells. The strong correlation between these states is
described by an effective Hamiltonian for the resonant subspace. This
Hamiltonian exhibits quantum phase transitions associated with an Ising density
wave order, and with the appearance of superfluidity in the directions
transverse to the electric field. We suggest that the observed resonant
response is related to these transitions, and propose experiments to directly
detect the order parameters. The generalizations to electric fields applied in
different directions, and to a variety of lattices, should allow study of
numerous other correlated quantum phases.

matrix linearly into the set of density matrices. These dynamical stochastic
maps form a linear convex set that may be viewed as supermatrices. The property
of hermiticity of density matrices renders an associated supermatrix hermitian
and hence diagonalizable. The positivity of the density matrix does not make
the associated supermatrix positive though. If the map itself is positive, it
is called completely positive and they have a simple parameterization. This is
extended to all positive (not completely positive) maps. A general dynamical

in solving instances of NP-complete problems. The algorithm is governed by the
adiabatic theorem. Therefore, in order to reduce the running time, it is
essential to examine the minimum energy gap between the ground level and the
next one through the evolution. In this letter, we show a way of speedup in
quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm, using the extended Hamiltonian. We
present the exact relation between the energy gap and the elements of the
extended Hamiltonian, which provides the new point of view to reduce the

reformulates and extends standard quantum theory. The proposed theory is
`realistic' in the sense that in it, a general M-level quantum state is
represented by a single real number r. Surprising as it may seem, this real
number is shown to contain the same probabilistic information as the standard
Hilbert-space state, plus additional information from which measurement outcome
is determined. A crucial concept in achieving this is that of Borelian
(number-theoretic) normality. The essential role of complex numbers in standard
quantum theory is subsumed by the action of a set of self-similar permutation
operators on the digits and places of the base-M expansion of a base-M
Borelian-normal r; these permutation operators are shown to have complex
structure and leave invariant the normality of the underlying real number. The
set of real numbers generated by these permutations defines not only the
Hilbert space of standard quantum theory, but also, in addition, the sample
space from which quantum measurement outcomes can be objectively determined.
Dynamical real-number state reduction is precisely described by deterministic
number-theoretic operators that reduce the degree of normality of r; from the
degree of normality one can infer the standard quantum-theoretic trace rule for
measurement probability. All the foundational difficulties of standard quantum
theory are described in terms of the proposed theory. It is shown that the
real-number states of the proposed theory are precisely its beables.

show that it generally helps to act with $U_{AB}$ on an entangled state.
Allowing ancillas, we present numerical results from which we can conclude,
quite generally, that allowing initial entanglement typically increases the
optimal capacity in this case as well. Next, we show that allowing collective

resonant dipole-dipole interaction between two-level atoms and the resonant
atom-field interaction are derived, which can suitably be used for studying the
influence of arbitrary dispersing and absorbing material surroundings on these
interactions. The theory is applied to the study of the transient behavior of
two atoms that initially share a single excitation, with special emphasis on
the role of the two competing processes of virtual and real photon exchange in
the energy transfer between the atoms. In particular, it is shown that for weak
atom-field interaction there is a time window, where the energy transfer
follows a rate regime of the type obtained by ordinary second-order
perturbation theory. Finally, the resonant dipole-dipole interaction is shown
to give rise to a doublet spectrum of the emitted light for weak atom-field
interaction and a triplet spectrum for strong atom-field interaction.

against a quantum-gravity phenomenology and suggests that a quantum theory of

coupled nonlinear oscillators with a two-frequency external force. In the
classical description, this peculiar diffusion is due to the onset of a weak
chaos in a narrow stochastic layer near the separatrix of the coupling
resonance. We have found that global dependence of the quantum diffusion
coefficient on model parameters mimics, to some extent, the classical data.
However, the quantum diffusion happens to be slower that the classical one.
Another result is the dynamical localization that leads to a saturation of the
diffusion after some characteristic time. We show that this effect has the same
nature as for the studied earlier dynamical localization in the presence of
global chaos. The quantum Arnol'd diffusion represents a new type of quantum
dynamics and can be observed, for example, in 2D semiconductor structures

Within such an interpretation, as Ballentine and Jarret pointed out long ago,
Bell's theorem does not demonstrate any nonlocality.

Since any operation should be symmetrized over all the identical particles and
there is the precondition that the spatial wave functions overlap, the meaning
of identical-particle entanglement is fundamentally different from that of
distinguishable particles. The identical-particle counterpart of the Schmidt
basis is shown to be the single-particle basis in which the one-particle
reduced density matrix is diagonal. But it does not play a special role in the
issue of entanglement, which depends on the single-particle basis chosen. The
nonfactorization due to (anti)symmetrization is naturally excluded by using the
(anti)symmetrized basis or, equivalently, the particle number representation.
The natural degrees of freedom in quantifying the identical-particle
entanglement in a chosen single-particle basis are occupation numbers of
different single particle basis states. The entanglement between effectively
distinguishable spins is shown to be a special case of the occupation-number
entanglement.

model to describe cognitive experiments to check quantum-like structures of
mental processes. The crucial role is played by interference of probabilities
for mental observables. Recently one of such experiments based on recognition
of images was performed. This experiment confirmed our prediction on
quantum-like behaviour of mind. In our approach ``quantumness of mind'' has no
direct relation to the fact that the brain (as any physical body) is composed
of quantum particles. We invented a new terminology ``quantum-like (QL) mind.''
Cognitive QL-behaviour is characterized by nonzero coefficient of interference
$\lambda.$ This coefficient can be found on the basis of statistical data.
There is predicted not only $\cos \theta$-interference of probabilities, but
also hyperbolic $\cosh \theta$-interference. This interference was never
observed for physical systems, but we could not exclude this possibility for
cognitive systems. We propose a model of brain functioning as QL-computer

should exist, which does not require the concept of time, and that the
appropriate mathematical language for such a formulation is noncommutative
differential geometry. In the present paper we discuss this formulation for the
free point particle, by introducing a commutation relation for a set of
noncommuting coordinates. The sought for background independent quantum
mechanics is derived from this commutation relation for the coordinates. We
propose that the basic equations are invariant under automorphisms which map
one set of coordinates to another- this is a natural generalization of
diffeomorphism invariance when one makes a transition to noncommutative
geometry. The background independent description becomes equivalent to standard
quantum mechanics if a spacetime manifold exists, because of the proposed
automorphism invariance. The suggested basic equations also give a quantum
gravitational description of the free particle.

know the outcome, are we able to retrodict it with a second measurement? We
obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for perfect retrodiction of the
outcome of a known generalised measurement, given the final state, for an
arbitrary initial state. From this, we deduce that, when the input and output
Hilbert spaces have equal (finite) dimension, it is impossible to perfectly
retrodict the outcome of any fine-grained measurement (where each POVM element
corresponds to a single Kraus operator) for all initial states unless the
measurement is unitarily equivalent to a projective measurement. It also
enables us to show that every POVM can be realised in such a way that perfect
outcome retrodiction is possible for an arbitrary initial state when the number
of outcomes does not exceed the output Hilbert space dimension. We then
consider the situation where the initial state is not arbitrary, though it may
be entangled, and describe the conditions under which unambiguous outcome
retrodiction is possible for a fine-grained generalised measurement. We find
that this is possible for some state if the Kraus operators are linearly
independent. This condition is also necessary when the Kraus operators are
non-singular. From this, we deduce that every trace-preserving quantum
operation is associated with a generalised measurement whose outcome is
unambiguously retrodictable for some initial state, and also that a set of
unitary operators can be unambiguously discriminated iff they are linearly
independent. We then examine the issue of unambiguous outcome retrodiction
without entanglement. This has important connections with the theory of locally
linearly dependent and locally linearly independent operators.

framework of non-commutative topological spaces and ``points, speaking to each

depth-structure of our macroscopic space-time and made visible by the
application of a new geometric renormalisation process, and the apparent but
difficult to understand translocal features of quantum theory. We argue that
the conception of our space-time continuum as being basically an aggregate of
structureless points is almost surely to poor and has to be extended and that
the conceptual structure of quantum theory, in particular its translocal
features like e.g. entanglement and complex superposition, are exactly a
mesoscopic consequence of this microscopic wormhole structure. We emphasize the
close connections with the ``small world phenomenon'' and rigorously show that
the micro state of our space-time, viewed as a dynamical system, has to be
critical in a scale free way as recently observed in other fields of network

and external degrees of the ion, performed by using an off-resonant pulse.
Several typical quantum gates, including Hadamard gate, controlled-Z and
controlled-NOT gates $etc.$, can thus be implemented exactly by using these
elementary operations. The experimental parameters including the LD parameter
and the durations of the applied laser pulses, for these implementation are
derived analytically and numerically. Neither the LD approximation for the
laser-ion interaction nor the auxiliary atomic level is needed in the present
scheme.

  capacities</title><description>  Entanglement shared between the two ends of a quantum communication channel
has been shown to be a useful resource in increasing both the quantum and
classical capacities for these channels. The entanglement-assisted capacities
were derived assuming an unlimited amount of shared entanglement per channel
use. In this paper, bounds are derived on the minimum amount of entanglement
required per use of a channel, in order to asymptotically achieve the capacity.
This is achieved by introducing a class of entanglement-assisted quantum codes.
Codes for classes of qubit channels are shown to achieve the quantum
entanglement-assisted channel capacity when an amount of shared entanglement
per channel given by, E = 1 - Q_E, is provided. It is also shown that for very
noisy channels, as the capacities become small, the amount of required
entanglement converges for the classical and quantum capacities.

  symmetric multi-particle states</title><description>  We propose a technique for robust and efficient navigation in the Hilbert
space of entangled symmetric states of a multiparticle system with externally
controllable linear and nonlinear collective interactions. A linearly changing
external field applied along the quantization axis creates a network of well
separated level crossings in the energy diagram of the collective states. One
or more transverse pulsed fields applied at the times of specific level
crossings induce adiabatic passage between these states. By choosing the timing
of the pulsed field appropriately, one can transfer an initial product state of
all N spins into (i) any symmetric state with n spin excitations and (ii) the
N-particle analog of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state. This technique,
unlike techniques using pulses of specific area, does not require precise
knowledge of the number of particles and is robust against variations in the
interaction parameters. We discuss potential applications in two-component Bose
condensates and ion-trap systems.

quantum mechanical systems, confined within a rigid impenetrable spherical box
of radius $r_0$, in the framework of Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB)
approximation. Instead of considering the Langer correction for the centrifugal
term, the approach adopted here is that of Hainz and Grabert : The centrifugal
term is expanded perturbatively (in powers of $\hbar$), decomposing it into 2
terms -- the classical centrifugal potential and a quantum correction. Hainz

hydrogen atom, to the first order in $\hbar$, with all higher order corrections
vanishing. In the present study, this formalism is extended to the case of
radial potentials under hard wall confinement, to check whether the same
argument holds good for such confined systems as well. As explicit examples, 3
widely known potentials are studied, which are of considerable importance in
the theoretical treatment of various atomic phenomena involving atomic

and a receiver R sharing a classical private key want to exchange a classical
message with the guarantee that the message has not been modified by any third
party with control of the communication line. In this paper we define and
investigate the authentication of messages composed of quantum states. Assuming
S and R have access to an insecure quantum channel and share a private,
classical random key, we provide a non-interactive scheme that enables S both
to encrypt and to authenticate (with unconditional security) an m qubit message
by encoding it into m+s qubits, where the failure probability decreases
exponentially in the security parameter s. The classical private key is 2m+O(s)
bits. To achieve this, we give a highly efficient protocol for testing the
purity of shared EPR pairs. We also show that any scheme to authenticate
quantum messages must also encrypt them. (In contrast, one can authenticate a
classical message while leaving it publicly readable.) This has two important
consequences: On one hand, it allows us to give a lower bound of 2m key bits
for authenticating m qubits, which makes our protocol asymptotically optimal.
On the other hand, we use it to show that digitally signing quantum states is
impossible, even with only computational security.

Reformulating the problem in momentum space leads to an integral form of the

The eigenfunctions are then expanded in terms of spherical harmonics, and this
leads to an integral relation in terms of special functions which has not

different alternatives of the system. A unified description of both
probabilities and phases comes through a generalisation of the notion of a
density matrix for histories; this object is the decoherence functional of the
consistent histories approach. If we take phases as well as probabilities as
primitive elements of our theory, we abandon Kolmogorov probability and can
describe quantum theory in terms of fundamental commutative observables,
without being obstructed by Bell's and related theorems. Generalising the
theory of stochastic processes, we develop the description of relative phases
and probabilities for paths on the classical phase space. This description
provides a theory of quantum processes. We identify a number of basic
postulates and study its corresponding properties. We strongly emphasise the
notion of conditioning and are able to write ``quantum differential equations''
as analogous to stochastic differential equations. These can be interpreted as
referring to individual systems. We, then, show the sense in which quantum
theory is equivalent to a quantum process on phase space (using coherent
states). Conversely, starting from quantum processes on phase space we recover
standard quantum theory on Hilbert space from the requirement that the process
satisfies (the Markov property together with time reversibility. The
statistical predictions of our theory are identical to the ones of standard
quantum theory, but the ``logic'' of events is Boolean; events are not
represented by projectors any more. We discuss some implication of this fact
for the interpretation of quantum theory, emphasising that it makes plausible
the existence of realist theories for individual quantum systems.

along a quantum spin chain (1-D antiferromagnet) having a singlet ground state
with a finite spin gap to the lowest excited state caused by some quantum
effect. Irradiation of a microwave tuned to the spin gap energy excites a
packet of triplet magnons at a specific part of the chain where control and
target qubits are involved. The packet switches on the Suhl-Nakamura
interaction between the qubits, which serves as a controlled NOT gate. The

semiconducting sheets attached to the spin chain, where spin polarizations
created by the optical pumping method in the semiconductors are transferred to
the spin chain. The scheme allows us to separate the initialization process
from the computation, so that one can optimize the computation part without

postulated to represent a different aspect of a physical state rather than a

through several physical situations. Among the results is a somewhat surprising
resolution of a paradox in a three-spin Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger experiment

at will. Action-angle coordinates are most convenient for this purpose. Written
with respect to these coordinates, a Hamiltonian and first integrals depend
only on the action ones. We introduce a suitable perturbation of a Hamiltonian
by a term containing time-dependent parameters so that an evolution of action
variables is nothing else than a displacement along a curve in a parameter

of quantum mechanics, approximate cloning is possible. A natural way of
realizing quantum cloning of photons is by stimulated emission. In this context
the fundamental quantum limit to the quality of the clones is imposed by the
unavoidable presence of spontaneous emission. In our experiment a single input
photon stimulates the emission of additional photons from a source based on
parametric down-conversion. This leads to the production of quantum clones with
near optimal fidelity. We also demonstrate universality of the copying
procedure by showing that the same fidelity is achieved for arbitrary input

2/3. As it is well known, the value 2/3 can be achieved in one step, by a
single ideal measurement of the polarization along a random direction. I
analyze the opposite strategy which is the long sequence of unsharp
polarization measurements. The evolution of the qubit under the influence of
repeated measurements is quite complicated in the general case. Fortunately, in
a certain limit of very unsharp measurements the qubit will obey simple
stochastic evolution equations known for long under the name of time-continuous
measurement theory. I discuss how the outcomes of the very unsharp measurements
will asymptotically contribute to our knowledge of the original qubit. It is
reassuring that the fidelity will achieve the optimum 2/3 for long enough
sequences of the unsharp measurements.

  ensemble and on the mutually unbiased bases</title><description>  I consider the tradeoff between the information gained about an initially
unknown quantum state, and the disturbance caused to that state by the
measurement process. I show that for any distribution of initial states, the
information-disturbance frontier is convex, and disturbance is nondecreasing
with information gain. I consider the most general model of quantum
measurements, and all post-measurement dynamics compatible with a given
measurement. For the uniform initial distribution over states, I show that the
least-disturbing way of making any measurement is with conditional dynamics
satisfying a generalization of the projection postulate, the ``square-root
dynamics.'' Thus, procedures for achieving a point on the
information-disturbance frontier may be assumed to involve such conditional
dynamics. Also, the information-disturbance frontier for the uniform ensemble
may be achieved with ``isotropic'' (unitarily covariant) dynamics. This results
in a significant simplification of the optimization problem for calculating the
tradeoff in this case, giving hope for a closed-form solution. I also show that
the discrete ensembles uniform on the d(d+1) vectors of a certain set of d+1
``mutually unbiased'' or conjugate bases in d dimensions form spherical
2-designs in CP_{d-1} when d is a power of an odd prime. This implies that many
of the results of the paper apply also to these discrete ensembles.

by means of its states, contexts and properties. The entity that we want to
describe does not necessarily have to be a physical entity, but can also be an
entity of a more abstract nature, for example a concept, or a cultural
artifact, or the mind of a person, etc..., which means that we aim at very
general description. The effect that a context has on the state of the entity
plays a fundamental role, which means that our approach is intrinsically
contextual. The approach is inspired by the mathematical formalisms that have
been developed in axiomatic quantum mechanics, where a specific type of quantum
contextuality is modelled. However, because in general states also influence
context -- which is not the case in quantum mechanics -- we need a more general
setting than the one used there. Our focus on context as a fundamental concept
makes it possible to unify `dynamical change' and `change under influence of
measurement', which makes our approach also more general and more powerful than
the traditional quantum axiomatic approaches. For this reason an experiment (or
measurement) is introduced as a specific kind of context. Mathematically we
introduce a state context property system as the structure to describe an
entity by means of its states, contexts and properties. We also strive from the
start to a categorical setting and derive the morphisms between state context
property systems from a merological covariance principle. We introduce the
category SCOP with as elements the state context property systems and as
morphisms the ones that we derived from this merological covariance principle.
We introduce property completeness and state completeness and study the
operational foundation of the formalism

'real' if we know that if we would try to test whether this object is present,
this test would give us the answer 'yes' with certainty. If we consider a
conception of reality where probability plays a fundamental role it can be
shown that standard probability theory is not well suited to substitute
'certainty' by means of 'probability equal to 1'. The analysis of this problem
leads us to propose a new type of probability theory that is a generalization
of standard probability theory. This new type of probability is a function to
the set of all subsets of the interval [0, 1] instead of to the interval [0, 1]
itself, and hence its evaluation happens by means of a subset instead of a
number. This subset corresponds to the different limits of sequences of
relative frequency that can arise when an intrinsic lack of knowledge about the
context and how it influences the state of the physical entity under study in
the process of experimentation is taken into account. The new probability
theory makes it possible to define probability on the whole set of experiments
within the Geneva-Brussels approach to quantum mechanics, which was not
possible with standard probability theory. We introduce the structure of a
'state experiment probability system' and derive the state property system as a
special case of this structure. The category SEP of state experiment
probability systems and their morphisms is linked with the category SP of state
property systems and their morphisms

Property (SCOP) formalism, originally developed as a generalization of quantum

used, and combined to generate meaning. The quantum formalism was developed to
cope with problems arising in the description of (1) the measurement process,
and (2) the generation of new states with new properties when particles become
entangled. Similar problems arising with concepts motivated the formal
treatment introduced here. Concepts are viewed not as fixed representations,
but entities existing in states of potentiality that require interaction with a
context--a stimulus or another concept--to 'collapse' to an instantiated form
(e.g. exemplar, prototype, or other possibly imaginary instance). The stimulus
situation plays the role of the measurement in physics, acting as context that
induces a change of the cognitive state from superposition state to collapsed
state. The collapsed state is more likely to consist of a conjunction of
concepts for associative than analytic thought because more stimulus or concept
properties take part in the collapse. We provide two contextual measures of
conceptual distance--one using collapse probabilities and the other weighted
properties--and show how they can be applied to conjunctions using the pet fish

exact solutions of the time-dependent Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equations governing
various three-generator quantum systems. For some quantum systems whose
time-dependent Hamiltonians have no quasialgebraic structures, we show that the
exact solutions can also be obtained by working in a sub-Hilbert-space

trajectory approach to a measurement problem of a two-state quantum system (a
qubit), an electron coherently tunneling between two coupled quantum dots
(CQD's) measured by a low transparency point contact (PC) detector. We show
that the master equation of ``partially'' reduced density matrix can be derived
from the quantum trajectory equation (stochastic master equation) by simply
taking a ``partial'' average over the all possible outcomes of the measurement.
If a full ensemble average is taken, the traditional (unconditional) master
equation of reduced density matrix is then obtained. This unified picture, in
terms of averaging over (tracing out) different amount of detection records
(detector states), for these seemingly different approaches reported in the
literature is particularly easy to understand using our formalism. To further
demonstrate this connection, we analyze an important ensemble quantity for an
initial qubit state readout experiment, $P(N,t)$, the probability distribution
of finding $N$ electrons that have tunneled through the PC barrier in time $t$.
The simulation results of $P(N,t)$ using 10000 quantum trajectories and
corresponding measurement records are, as expected, in very good agreement with
those obtained from the Fourier analysis of the ``partially'' reduced density
matrix. However, the quantum trajectory approach provides more information and
more physical insights into the ensemble and time averaged quantity $P(N,t)$.
Each quantum trajectory resembles a single history of the qubit state in a
single run of the continuous measurement experiment. We finally discuss, in
this approach, the possibility of reading out the state of the qubit system in
a single-shot experiment.

the probability of a detection error when distinguishing between a collection
of quantum states, represented by a set of density operators. We show that the
design of the optimal detector can be formulated as a semidefinite programming
problem. Based on this formulation, we derive a set of necessary and sufficient
conditions for an optimal quantum measurement. We then show that the optimal
measurement can be found by solving a standard (convex) semidefinite program
followed by the solution of a set of linear equations or, at worst, a standard
linear programming problem. By exploiting the many well-known algorithms for
solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge to the global
optimum, the optimal measurement can be computed very efficiently in polynomial
time.
  Using the semidefinite programming formulation, we also show that the rank of
each optimal measurement operator is no larger than the rank of the
corresponding density operator. In particular, if the quantum state ensemble is
a pure-state ensemble consisting of (not necessarily independent) rank-one
density operators, then we show that the optimal measurement is a pure-state
measurement consisting of rank-one measurement operators.

that all the physical information on a 5D massless particle propagation is
provided by the statistics over null paths in this 5D space-time. If the 5D
metric is independent of the fifth coordinate, then the propagation problem can
be reduced to four dimensions by foliation along the fifth coordinate, and we
obtain a formulation of 4D Quantum Mechanics. If the 5D metric is independent
of time, we foliate along the time coordinate, and obtain a formulation of 4D
Statistical Mechanics. If the 5D metric is independent of both time and the
fifth coordinate, then Quantum and Statistical Mechanics are pictures of the

Klein-Gordon equation, and a 5D Special Relativity, completing our

rho({qi},{pj}) reproducing them as marginals; this settles a long standing

instead at most three compatible probabilities, there always exist an

agree nicely with the available results to-date. The solutions for classical
anharmonic oscillators are used to obtain the solutions corresponding to
quantum anharmonic oscillators by imposing fundamental commutation relations

behind entanglement, that is Geometric Invariant Theory. More specifically
relation between these two subjects can be described by the following theses.
  (i) Total variance of completely entangled state is maximal. (ii) This
distinguishes the state as a minimal vector in its orbit under action of
complexified dynamic group.
  (iii) An ultimate aim of Geometric Invariant Theory is a description of
complex orbits and their minimal vectors. It suggests that noncompletely
entangled states are just GIT semistable vectors.

  case study for the Scarf II potential</title><description>  Motivated by the duality of normalizable states and the presence of the
quasi-parity quantum number q=+/-1 in PT symmetric (non-Hermitian) quantum
mechanical potential models, the relation of PT symmetry and supersymmetry
(SUSY) is studied. As an illustrative example the PT invariant version of the
Scarf II potential is presented, and it is shown that the &quot;bosonic&quot; Hamiltonian
has two different &quot;fermionic&quot; SUSY partner Hamiltonians (potentials) generated
from the ground-state solutions with q=1 and q=-1. It is shown that the
&quot;fermionic&quot; potentials cease to be PT invariant when the PT symmetry of the
&quot;bosonic&quot; potential is spontaneously broken. A modified PT symmetry inspired
SUSY construction is also discussed, in which the SUSY charge operators contain
the antilinear operator T. It is shown that in this scheme the &quot;fermionic&quot;
Hamitonians are just the complex conjugate of the original &quot;fermionic&quot;
Hamiltonians, and thus possess the same energy eigenvalues.

  and Quantum Computers</title><description>  The paper studies quantum complexity, tractability, and strong tractability
for high dimensional multivariate approximation. We study a space of functions
important in many applications. A function space is weighted if certain
variables are more important than others; the weights show the relative
importance of the variables. In an unweighted space all variables are equally
important and multivariate approximation is intractable. We want to study when
the complexity of multivariate approximation is independent of the number of
variables and depends polynomially on 1/E. The main conclusions are:
Multivariate approximation on a quantum computer can be solved roughly
(1/E)^(1+r) times faster than on a classical computer using randomization.
Here, r is a positive parameter that depends on the weights and may be large.
This means that the speed-up of quantum over classical computers may be much
larger than quadratic. Multivariate approximation on a quantum computer is
exponentially faster than on a classical computer with a worst case assurance
even if the sum of weights is infinite but a certain power of them is finite.
We have designed a quantum algorithm with error at most E that uses about
d+log(1/E) qubits. Hence, we have only linear dependence on the dimension d and
logarithmic dependence on 1/E. Therefore, for some applications the number of
qubits is quite modest.

the two-photon detuning $\delta$ is less than the collective coupling strength

efficiency (&gt;99%), and to distinguish the number of photons in a given time
interval is a very challenging technical problem with enormous potential
pay-offs in quantum communications and information processing. Our proposal
diverges from standard solid-state photo-detector technology by employing an
atomic vapor as the active medium, prepared in a specific quantum state using
laser radiation. The absorption of a photon will be aided by a dressing laser,
and the presence or absence of an excited atom will be detected using the
``cycling transition'' approach perfected for ion traps. By first incorporating
an appropriate upconversion scheme, our method can be applied to a wide variety
of optical wavelengths.

quantum mechanics. For a class of observables with matrix-valued Weyl symbols
proportional to the identity matrix, the Weyl-Wigner-Moyal formalism is
proposed. The evolution equations are found to coincide with their counterparts
in relativistic quantum mechanics with non-local Hamiltonian. The difference
between the theories is connected with peculiarities of the constraints on the
initial conditions. Effective increase in coherence between eigenstates of the

non-trivial charge structure of the position and momentum operators and satisfy
the charge superselection rule are considered. On this basis, the entangled

U(N) and Sp(2N), and show that the problem of including the Poincare algebra

  Capacities of Three Symmetric Pure States in Three Dimensions</title><description>  We investigate the capacity of three symmetric quantum states in three real
dimensions to carry classical information. Several such capacities have already
been defined, depending on what operations are allowed in the sending and
receiving protocols. These include the C_{1,1} capacity, which is the capacity
achievable if separate measurements must be used for each of the received
states, and the C_{1,infinity} capacity, which is the capacity achievable if
joint measurements are allowed on the tensor product of all the received
states. We discover a new classical information capacity of quantum channels,
the adaptive capacity C_{1,A}, which lies strictly between the C_{1,1} and the
C_{1,infinity} capacities. The adaptive capacity requires each of the signals
to be measured by a separate apparatus, but allows the quantum states of these
signals to be measured in stages, with the first stage partially reducing their
quantum states, and where measurements in subsequent stages which further
reduce the quantum states may depend on the results of a classical computation
taking as input the outcomes of the first round of measurements.

continuous variables, momentum and position. Interference can only occur if the

Hamiltonian of an unstable system using as an example potential resonance
scattering with a fixed angular momentum. We present a consistent self-adjoint
formulation of the problem of scattering on a finite-range potential, which is
based on separation of the configuration space on two, internal and external,
segments. The scattering amplitude is expressed in terms of the resolvent of a
non-Hermitian operator H. The explicit form of this operator depends both on
the radius of separation and the boundary conditions at this place which can be
chosen in many different ways. We discuss this freedom and show explicitly that
the physical scattering amplitude is, nevertheless, unique though not all
choices are equally adequate from the physical point of view. The
energy-dependent operator H should not be confused with the non-Hermitian
effective Hamiltonian H_{eff} exploited usually to describe interference of
overlapping resonances. We apply the developed formalism to a chain of L
delta-barriers whose solution is also found independently in a closed form. For
a fixed band of L overlapping resonances, the smooth energy dependence of H can
be ignored so that complex eigenvalues of the LxL submatrix H_{eff} define the
energies and widths of the resonances.We construct H_{eff} for the two commonly
considered types of the boundary conditions (Neumann and Dirichlet) for the
internal motion. Formation in the outer well of a short-lived doorway state is
explicitly demonstrated together with the appearance of L-1 long-lived states
trapped in the inner part of the chain.

other search methods, classical and quantum, for random satisfiability (SAT)
problems. With the number of steps growing only as the cube of the number of
variables, the adiabatic method gives solution probabilities close to 1 for
problem sizes feasible to evaluate via simulation on current computers.
However, for these sizes the minimum energy gaps of most instances are fairly
large, so the good performance scaling seen for small problems may not reflect
asymptotic behavior where costs are dominated by tiny gaps. Moreover, the
resulting search costs are much higher than for other methods. Variants of the
quantum algorithm that do not match the adiabatic limit give lower costs, on
average, and slower growth than the conventional GSAT heuristic method.

net effect of coding, decoherence (a physical channel acting on qubits in the
codeword) and recovery can be represented exactly by an effective channel
acting directly on the logical qubit. In this paper we describe a procedure for
deriving the map between physical and effective channels that results from a
given coding and recovery procedure. We show that the map for a concatenation
of codes is given by the composition of the maps for the constituent codes.
This perspective leads to an efficient means for calculating the exact
performance of quantum codes with arbitrary levels of concatenation. We present
explicit results for single-bit Pauli channels. For certain codes under the
symmetric depolarizing channel, we use the coding maps to compute exact
threshold error probabilities for achievability of perfect fidelity in the
infinite concatenation limit.

providing a simple example of how non-unitary processes which approximate

one photon regardless of the size of the database, thereby establishing an

simple example demonstrating that in terms of the number of database queries,
the procedure outlined here can outperform the best classical one.

structure, but a fluctuating quantum operator which may assume a coherent
superposition of two classically-distinguishable values. A natural question to
ask is what happens to the notion of simultaneity and synchronization when the
metric is in a quantum superposition. Here we show that the resource of
distributed entanglement of the same kind as used by Jozsa et al. [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 85, 2010 (2000)] gives rise to an experimental probe that is sensitive to
coherent quantum fluctuations in the spacetime metric.

  dimensions</title><description>  For the special case of freely evolving Dirac electrons in $1 + 1$
dimensions, Feynman checkerboard paths have previously been used to derive
Wigner's arrival-time distribution which includes all arrivals. Here, an
attempt is made to use these paths to determine the corresponding distribution
of first-arrival times. Simple analytic expressions are obtained for the
relevant components of the first-arrival propagator. These are used to
investigate the relative importance of the first-arrival contribution to the
Wigner arrival-time distribution and of the contribution arising from
interference between first and later (i.e. second, third, ...) arrivals. It is
found that a distribution of (intrinsic) first-arrival times for a Dirac
electron cannot in general be consistently defined using checkerboard paths,
not even approximately in the nonrelativistic regime.

in complex Hilbert space, defined by a trace action, assuming cyclic invariance
under the trace and the presence of a global unitary invariance. With plausible
and explicitly stated assumptions, including the existence of a large hierarchy
of scale between the underlying dynamics and observed physics, we show that (1)
the equilibrium statistical mechanics of this matrix dynamics, in the canonical
ensemble, gives rise to an emergent quantum mechanics for many degrees of
freedom, including the standard canonical commutation/anticommutation relations
and the usual unitary Heisenberg and Schr\&quot;odinger picture time evolutions of
operators and states, and (2) the fluctuation or Brownian motion corrections to
this thermodyamics lead to an energy-driven stochastic modification of the
Schr\&quot;odinger equation, which is known to imply state vector reduction with
Born rule probabilities. Thus, quantum mechanics and its probabilistic
interpretation both arise as emergent phenomena in the underlying trace
dynamics.

continuously violate the Gibbsian interchangeability of molecules. The
spontaneous restoration of interchangeability constitutes the mechanism of
irreversibility. This is the main suggestion of the Letter. We also point out
that the irreversible entropy can partially be rescued if the size of the
medium is finite. The rescueable entropy is found to be proportional to the

quantum bits. We observe that the violation of any of these inequalities by a
quantum state implies that pure-state entanglement can be distilled from it.
The corresponding distillation protocol may require that some of the parties
join into several groups. We show that there exists a link between the amount
of the Bell inequality violation and the size of the groups they have to form
for distillation. Thus, a strong violation is always sufficient for full
N-partite distillability. This result also allows for a security proof of
multi-partite quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols.

  Applied to Quantum Gravity</title><description>  All current approaches to quantum gravity employ essentially standard quantum
theory including, in particular, continuum quantities such as the real or
complex numbers. However, I wish to argue that this may be fundamentally wrong
in so far as the use of these continuum quantities in standard quantum theory
can be traced back to certain {\em a priori} assumptions about the nature of
space and time: assumptions that may be incompatible with the view of space and
time adopted by a quantum gravity theory. My conjecture is that in, some yet to
be determined sense, to each type of space-time there is associated a
corresponding type of quantum theory in which continuum quantities do not
necessarily appear, being replaced with structures that are appropriate to the
specific space-time.
  Topos theory then arises as a possible tool for `gluing' together these
different theories associated with the different space-times. As a concrete
example of the use of topos ideas, I summarise recent work applying presheaf
theory to the Kochen-Specher theorem and the assignment of values to physical
quantities in a quantum theory.

  Discrimination of Quantum States</title><description>  In this paper we consider the problem of unambiguous discrimination between a
set of linearly independent pure quantum states. We show that the design of the
optimal measurement that minimizes the probability of an inconclusive result
can be formulated as a semidefinite programming problem. Based on this
formulation, we develop a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for an
optimal quantum measurement. We show that the optimal measurement can be
computed very efficiently in polynomial time by exploiting the many well-known
algorithms for solving semidefinite programs, which are guaranteed to converge
to the global optimum.
  Using the general conditions for optimality, we derive necessary and
sufficient conditions so that the measurement that results in an equal
probability of an inconclusive result for each one of the quantum states is
optimal. We refer to this measurement as the equal-probability measurement
(EPM). We then show that for any state set, the prior probabilities of the
states can be chosen such that the EPM is optimal.
  Finally, we consider state sets with strong symmetry properties and equal
prior probabilities for which the EPM is optimal. We first consider
geometrically uniform state sets that are defined over a group of unitary
matrices and are generated by a single generating vector. We then consider
compound geometrically uniform state sets which are generated by a group of
unitary matrices using multiple generating vectors, where the generating
vectors satisfy a certain (weighted) norm constraint.

has focussed on the semiclassical analysis of the theory. In this paper we want
to comment on two such developments: 1) Polymer-like states for Maxwell theory
and linearized gravity constructed by Varadarajan which use much of the Hilbert
space machinery that has proved useful in QGR and 2) coherent states for QGR,
based on the general complexifier method, with built-in semiclassical
properties. We show the following: A) Varadarajan's states {\it are}
complexifier coherent states. This unifies all states constructed so far under
the general complexifier principle. B) Ashtekar and Lewandowski suggested a
non-Abelean generalization of Varadarajan's states to QGR which, however, are
no longer of the complexifier type. We construct a new class of non-Abelean
complexifiers which come close to the one underlying Varadarajan's
construction. C) Non-Abelean complexifiers close to Varadarajan's induce new
types of Hilbert spaces which do not support the operator algebra of QGR. The
analysis suggests that if one sticks to the present kinematical framework of
QGR and if kinematical coherent states are at all useful, then normalizable,
graph dependent states must be used which are produced by the complexifier
method as well. D) Present proposals for states with mildened graph dependence,
obtained by performing a graph average, do not approximate well coordinate
dependent observables. However, graph dependent states, whether averaged or
not, seem to be well suited for the semiclassical analysis of QGR with respect
to coordinate independent operators.

performed by adiabatically approaching two traps and allowing tunneling and
cold collisions to take place. We demonstrate the capability of this scheme to
realize a square-root of swap gate, and address the problem of double

of a pure state into a maximally entangled state of a desired size with success
probability being close to one in the asymptotic limit. We give the distillable
entanglement, the number of Bell pairs distilled per copy, as a function of an
error exponent, which represents the rate of decrease in failure probability as
n tends to infinity. The formula fills the gap between the least upper bound of
distillable entanglement in probabilistic concentration, which is the
well-known entropy of entanglement, and the maximum attained in deterministic
concentration. The method of types in information theory enables the detailed
analysis of the distillable entanglement in terms of the error rate. In
addition to the probabilistic argument, we consider another type of
entanglement concentration scheme, where the initial state is deterministically
transformed into a (possibly mixed) final state whose fidelity to a maximally
entangled state of a desired size converges to one in the asymptotic limit. We
show that the same formula as in the probabilistic argument is valid for the
argument on fidelity by replacing the success probability with the fidelity.
Furthermore, we also discuss entanglement yield when optimal success
probability or optimal fidelity converges to zero in the asymptotic limit
(strong converse), and give the explicit formulae for those cases.

with a large quantum system (the macrosystem) described by unknown stochastic
variables. The interaction between the two systems is diagonal for the
microsystem in a certain basis, and it leads to an imprint on the macrosystem.
Moreover, the interaction is assumed to involve only small transfers of energy
and momentum between the two systems (as compared to typical energies/momenta
within the microsystem). This makes it suitable to carry out the analysis in
scattering theory, where the transition amplitude for the whole system
factorizes. The interaction taking place within the macrosystem is assumed to
depend on the stochastic variables in such a way that, on the average, no
particular channel is favoured. The result is then, in the thermodynamic limit
of the macrosystem, that the whole system bifurcates and the microsystem ends
up in a state described by one of the basis vectors (in the mentioned basis).
The macrosystem ends up in an entangled state tied to this basis vector. For
the ensemble of macrosystems, the interaction with the microsystem leads, on
the average, to the usual decoherence and diagonal density matrix for the
microsystem. The macrosystem can be interpreted as representing a measurement
device for performing a measurement on the microsystem. The whole discussion is
carried out within quantum mechanics itself without any modification or
generalization.

  a one-dimensional harmonic atom trap</title><description>  An asymptotically exact many body theory for spin polarized interacting
fermions in a one-dimensional harmonic atom trap is developed using the
bosonization method and including backward scattering. In contrast to the
Luttinger model, backscattering in the trap generates one-particle potentials
which must be diagonalized simultaneously with the two-body interactions.
Inclusion of backscattering becomes necessary because backscattering is the
dominant interaction process between confined identical one-dimensional
fermions. The bosonization method is applied to the calculation of one-particle
matrix elements at zero temperature. A detailed discussion of the validity of
the results from bosonization is given, including a comparison with direct
numerical diagonalization in fermionic Hilbert space. A model for the
interaction coefficients is developed along the lines of the Luttinger model
with only one coupling constant $K$. With these results, particle densities,
the Wigner function, and the central pair correlation function are calculated
and displayed for large fermion numbers. It is shown how interactions modify
these quantities. The anomalous dimension of the pair correlation function in
the center of the trap is also discussed and found to be in accord with the
Luttinger model.

different density operators. These N state assignments represent the beliefs of
the parties about the system. We examine conditions for determining whether the
N state assignments are compatible. We distinguish two kinds of procedures for
assessing compatibility, the first based on the compatibility of the prior
beliefs on which the N state assignments are based and the second based on the
compatibility of predictive measurement probabilities they define. The first
procedure leads to a compatibility criterion proposed by Brun, Finkelstein, and
Mermin [BFM, Phys. Rev. A 65, 032315 (2002)]. The second procedure leads to a
hierarchy of measurement-based compatibility criteria which is fundamentally
different from the corresponding classical situation. Quantum mechanically none
of the measurement-based compatibility criteria is equivalent to the BFM

  determinants</title><description>  We find that multidimensional determinants &quot;hyperdeterminants&quot;, related to
entanglement measures (the so-called concurrence or 3-tangle for the 2 or 3
qubits, respectively), are derived from a duality between entangled states and
separable states. By means of the hyperdeterminant and its singularities, the
single copy of multipartite pure entangled states is classified into an onion
structure of every closed subset, similar to that by the local rank in the
bipartite case. This reveals how inequivalent multipartite entangled classes
are partially ordered under local actions. In particular, the generic entangled
class of the maximal dimension, distinguished as the nonzero hyperdeterminant,
does not include the maximally entangled states in Bell's inequalities in
general (e.g., in the $n \geq 4$ qubits), contrary to the widely known
bipartite or 3-qubit cases. It suggests that not only are they never locally
interconvertible with the majority of multipartite entangled states, but they
would have no grounds for the canonical n-partite entangled states. Our
classification is also useful for the mixed states.

the two pump fields into the signal and idler modes is achieved only

quantum channel, much akin to public coins in classical communication
protocols. Whereas shared randomness does not help in the transmission of
information, or significantly reduce the classical complexity of computing
functions (as compared to private-coin protocols), shared entanglement leads to
startling phenomena such as ``quantum teleportation'' and ``superdense
coding.''
  The problem of characterising the power of prior entanglement has puzzled
many researchers. In this paper, we revisit the problem of transmitting
classical bits over an entanglement-assisted quantum channel. We derive a new,
optimal bound on the number of quantum bits required for this task, for any
given probability of error. All known lower bounds in the setting of bounded
error entanglement-assisted communication are based on sophisticated
information theoretic arguments. In contrast, our result is derived from first
principles, using a simple linear algebraic technique.

We also analyse a sequence of multi-round protocol that tries to overcome the
drawbacks of the previously proposed protocols, in order to lower the bias. We
show an intricate cheating strategy for this sequence, which leads to a bias of
1/4. This indicates that a bias of 1/4 might be optimal in such protocols, and
also demonstrates that a cleverer proof technique may be required to show this
optimality.

quantum cosmology is a robust implication of the general quantization scheme.
The calculations also allow conclusions about modified operators in the full

decoherence is through the introduction of a &quot;quantum&quot; of time (chronon): which
implies replacing the differential Liouville--von Neumann equation with a
finite-difference version of it. In this way, one is given the possibility of
using a rather simple quantum equation to describe the decoherence effects due
to dissipation. Namely, the mere introduction (not of a &quot;time-lattice&quot;, but
simply) of a &quot;chronon&quot; allows us to go on from differential to
finite-difference equations; and in particular to write down the
quantum-theoretical equations (Schroedinger equation, Liouville--von Neumann
equation,...) in three different ways: &quot;retarded&quot;, &quot;symmetrical&quot;, and
&quot;advanced&quot;. One of such three formulations --the retarded one-- describes in an
elementary way a system which is exchanging (and losing) energy with the
environment; and in its density-matrix version, indeed, it can be easily shown
that all non-diagonal terms go to zero very rapidly. [A much larger

system conditioned on continuous monitoring of its output, such as by an ideal
photodetector. In practice an experimenter has access to an output filtered
through various electronic devices, rather than the microscopic states of the
detector. This introduces several imperfections into the measurement process,
of which only inefficiency has previously been incorporated into quantum
trajectory theory. However, all electronic devices have finite bandwidths, and
the consequent delay in conveying the output signal to the observer implies
that the evolution of the conditional state of the quantum system must be
non-Markovian. We present a general method of describing this evolution and
apply it to avalanche photodiodes (APDs) and to photoreceivers. We include the
effects of efficiency, dead time, bandwidth, electronic noise, and dark counts.
The essential idea is to treat the quantum system and classical detector
jointly, and to average over the latter to obtain the conditional quantum
state.
 The significance of our theory is that quantum trajectories for realistic
detection are necessary for sophisticated approaches to quantum feedback, and
our approach could be applied in many areas of physics.

avalanche photodiodes and photoreceivers. In this paper we present simulations
of these realistic quantum trajectories for a cavity QED scenario in order to
ascertain how the conditioned state varies from that obtained with perfect
detection. Large differences are found, and this is manifest in the average of
the conditional purity. Simulation also allows us to comprehensively
investigate how the quality of the the photoreceiver depends upon its physical
parameters. In particular, we present evidence that in the limit of small
electronic noise, the photoreceiver quality can be characterized by an {\em
effective} bandwidth, which depends upon the level of electronic noise and the
filter bandwidth. We establish this result as an appropriate limit for a
simpler, analytically solvable, system. We expect this to be a general result
in other applications of our theory.

concluded that Quantum Mechanics had to be incomplete. However, its extensions
involving additional &quot;hidden variables&quot;, allowing for the recovery of
determinism and locality, have been disproved experimentally (Bell's theorem).
Here, I present an opposite solution of the paradox based on the greater
indeterminism of the modern Quantum Field Theory (QFT) description of Particle
Physics, that prevents the preparation of any state having a definite number of
particles. The resulting uncertainty in photons radiation has interesting
consequences in Quantum Information Theory (e.g. cryptography and
teleportation). Moreover, since it allows for less elements of EPR physical
reality than the old non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics, QFT satisfies the EPR
condition of completeness without the need of hidden variables. The residual
physical reality does never violate locality, thus the unique objective proof
of &quot;quantum nonlocality&quot; is removed in an interpretation-independent way. On
the other hand, the supposed nonlocality of the EPR correlations turns out to
be a problem of the interpretation of the theory. If we do not rely on hidden
variables or new physics beyond QFT, the unique viable interpretation is a
minimal statistical one, that preserves locality and Lorentz symmetry.

multi-qubit states. However, the qubits are impossible to address individually
and as such cannot be independently measured or otherwise manipulated. We
propose two related schemes to coherently transfer the qubits which the cavity
state represents onto individual atoms, so that the qubits can then be
processed individually. In particular, our scheme can be combined with the
quantum cloning scheme of Simon and coworkers [C. Simon et al, PRL 84, 2993

  Fourier transform and causality</title><description>  The Fourier transform is often used to connect the Lorentzian energy
distribution for resonance scattering to the exponential time dependence for
decaying states. However, to apply the Fourier transform, one has to bend the
rules of standard quantum mechanics; the Lorentzian energy distribution must be
extended to the full real axis $-\infty&lt;E&lt;\infty$ instead of being bounded from
below $0\leq E &lt;\infty$ (``Fermi's approximation''). Then the Fourier transform
of the extended Lorentzian becomes the exponential, but only for times $t\geq
0$, a time asymmetry which is in conflict with the unitary group time evolution
of standard quantum mechanics. Extending the Fourier transform from
distributions to generalized vectors, we are led to Gamow kets, which possess a
Lorentzian energy distribution with $-\infty&lt;E&lt;\infty$ and have exponential
time evolution for $t\geq t_0 =0$ only. This leads to probability predictions
that do not violate causality.

questions regarding the quantities (Holevo) capacity of a quantum channel T and
entanglement of formation of a given bipartite state.
 In particular, using the Stinespring dilation theorem, we give a formula for
the channel capacity involving entanglement of formation. This can be used to
show that additivity of the latter for some states can be inferred from the
additivity of capacity for certain channels.
 We demonstrate this connection for a family of group--covariant channels,
allowing us to calculate the entanglement cost for many states, including some
where a strictly smaller upper bound on the distillable entanglement is known.
Group symmetry is used for more sophisticated analysis, giving formulas valid
for a class of channels. This is presented in a general framework, extending
recent findings of Vidal, Dur and Cirac (e-print quant-ph/0112131).
 We speculate on a general relation of superadditivity of the entanglement of
formation, which would imply both the general additivity of this function under
tensor products and of the Holevo capacity (with or without linear cost
constraints).

electrodynamics and trapped ions research has led to very high level laboratory
performances. Such a stimulating situation essentially stems from two decisive
advancements. The first is the invention of reliable protocols for the
manipulation of single atoms. The second is the ability to produce desired
bosonic environments on demand. These progresses have led to the possibility of
controlling the form of the coupling between individual atoms and an arbitrary
number of bosonic modes. As a consequence, fundamental matter-radiation
interaction models like, for instance, the JC model and most of its numerous
nonlinear multiphoton generalizations, have been realized or simulated in
laboratory and their dynamical features have been tested more or less in
detail. This topical paper reviews the state of the art of the theoretical
investigations and of the experimental observations concerning the dynamical
features of the coupling between single few-level atoms and two bosonic modes.
In the course of the paper we show that such a configuration provides an
excellent platform for investigating various quantum intermode correlation
effects tested or testable in the cavity quantum electrodynamics and trapped
ion experimental realms. In particular we discuss a mode-mode correlation
effect appearing in the dynamics of a two-level atom quadratically coupled to
two bosonic modes. This effect, named parity effect, consists in a high
sensitivity to the evenness or oddness of the total number of bosonic
excitations.

of a quantum particle with a square potential barrier becomes independent of
the barrier width in a range of barrier thickness. This is the Hartman effect,
which has been frequently associated with ``superluminality''. A fundamental
limitation on the effect is set by non-relativistic ``causality conditions''.
We demonstrate first that the causality conditions impose more restrictive
bounds on the negative time delays (time advancements) when no bound states are
present. These restrictive bounds are in agreement with a naive, and generally
false, causality argument based on the positivity of the ``extrapolated phase
time'', one of the quantities proposed to characterize the duration of the
barrier's traversal. Nevertheless, square wells may in fact lead to much larger
advancements than square barriers. We point out that close to thresholds of new
bound states the time advancement increases considerably, while, at the same
time, the transmission probability is large, which facilitates the possible
observation of the enhanced time advancement.

perhaps the only irrational feature of present day physics. There are
experimental results that reject nonlocal state reduction at a distance. Also,
there are arguments that show that signal locality itself can be violated if
there is true nonlocal collapse of the wavefunction. The Bell's inequalities,
the violation of which polarized physicists in favour of nonlocality, arise not
due to nonlocality, but due to ignoring prior information on correlations
encoded in the phase of local probability amplitudes. Here I discuss an

shows that there is no nonlocal state reduction during measurements on
entangled particles. Quantum mechanics is inconsistent if it includes the
concept of wavefunction collapse as a physical process for entangled

to quantum theory is developed on the basis of earlier work by Hartle, and used
to discuss relativistic forms of the paradoxes of spherical wave packet
collapse, Bohm's formulation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen, and Hardy's paradox.
It is argued that wave function collapse is not needed for introducing
probabilities into relativistic quantum mechanics, and in any case should never
be thought of as a physical process. Alternative approaches to stochastic time
dependence can be used to construct a physical picture of the measurement
process that is less misleading than collapse models. In particular, one can
employ a coarse-grained but fully quantum mechanical description in which
particles move along trajectories, with behavior under Lorentz transformations
the same as in classical relativistic physics, and detectors are triggered by
particles reaching them along such trajectories. States entangled between
spacelike separate regions are also legitimate quantum descriptions, and can be
consistently handled by the formalism presented here. The paradoxes in question
arise because of using modes of reasoning which, while correct for classical
physics, are inconsistent with the mathematical structure of quantum theory,
and are resolved (or tamed) by using a proper quantum analysis. In particular,
there is no need to invoke, nor any evidence for, mysterious long-range
superluminal influences, and thus no incompatibility, at least from this
source, between relativity theory and quantum mechanics.

product of Hilbert spaces and let $\tau_{0}$ be the closest separable state in
the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to an entangled state $\rho_{0}$. Let
$\tilde{\tau}_{0}$ denote the closest separable state to $\rho_{0}$ along the
line segment from $I/N$ to $\rho_{0}$ where $I$ is the identity matrix.
Following [pitrubmat] a witness $W_{0}$ detecting the entanglement of
$\rho_{0}$ can be constructed in terms of $I, \tau_{0}$ and $\tilde{\tau}_{0}$.
If representations of $\tau_{0}$ and $\tilde{\tau}_{0}$ as convex combinations
of separable projections are known, then the entanglement of $\rho_{0}$ can be
detected by local measurements. G\&quot;{u}hne \textit{et. al.} in [bruss1] obtain
the minimum number of measurement settings required for a class of two qubit
states. We use our geometric approach to generalize their result to the
corresponding two qudit case when $d$ is prime and obtain the minimum number of
measurement settings. In those particular bipartite cases,
$\tau_{0}=\tilde{\tau}_{0}$. We illustrate our general approach with a two
parameter family of three qubit bound entangled states for which $\tau_{0} \neq
\tilde{\tau}_{0}$ and we show our approach works for $n$ qubits.
  In [pitt] we elaborated on the role of a ``far face'' of the separable states
relative to a bound entangled state $\rho_{0}$ constructed from an orthogonal
unextendible product base. In this paper the geometric approach leads to an
entanglement witness expressible in terms of a constant times $I$ and a
separable density $\mu_{0}$ on the far face from $\rho_{0}$. Up to a
normalization this coincides with the witness obtained in [bruss1] for the
particular example analyzed there.

and quantum information. Classical information is locally accessible and allows
one to perform tasks such as physical work, while quantum information allows
one to perform tasks such as teleportation. It is shown that these two kinds of
information are complementarity in the sense that two parties can either gain
access to the quantum information, or to the classical information but not
both. This complementarity has a form very similar to the complementarities
usually encountered in quantum mechanics. For pure states, the entanglement
plays the role of Planck's constant. We also find another class of
complementarity relations which applies to operators, and is induced when two
parties can only perform local operations and communicate classical. In order
to formalize this notion we define the restricted commutator. Observables such
as the parity and phase of two qubits commute, but their restricted commutator
is non-zero. It is also found that complementarity is pure in the sense that
can be ''decoupled'' from the uncertainty principle.

bipartite mixed states by local operations and classical communication (LOCC).
We analyse the relations between the rates for different transitions and obtain
simple lower and upper bound for these transitions. In a transition from one
mixed state to another and back, the amount of irreversibility can be different
for different target states. Thus in a natural way, we get the concept of
&quot;amount&quot; of irreversibility in asymptotic manipulations of entanglement. We
investigate the behaviour of these transformation rates for different target
states. We show that with respect to asymptotic transition rates under LOCC,
the maximally entangled states do not have a special status. In the process, we
obtain that the entanglement of formation is additive for all maximally
correlated states. This allows us to show irreversibility in asymptotic
entanglement manipulations for maximally correlated states in 2x2. We show that
the possible nonequality of distillable entanglement under LOCC and that under
operations preserving the positivity of partial transposition, is related to
the behaviour of the transitions (under LOCC) to separable target states.

propagating on curved spacetimes (CST) from full fledged Quantum General
Relativity (QGR), starting from first principles. We stress that we do not
claim to have a satisfactory answer to this question, rather our intention is
to ignite a discussion by displaying the problems that have to be solved when
carrying out such a program. In the present paper we propose a scheme that one
might follow in order to arrive at such a limit. We discuss the technical and
conceptual problems that arise in doing so and how they can be solved in
principle. As to be expected, completely new issues arise due to the fact that
QGR is a background independent theory. For instance, fundamentally the notion
of a photon involves not only the Maxwell quantum field but also the metric
operator - in a sense, there is no photon vacuum state but a &quot;photon vacuum
operator&quot;! While in this first paper we focus on conceptual and abstract
aspects, for instance the definition of (fundamental) n-particle states (e.g.
photons), in the second paper we perform detailed calculations including, among
other things, coherent state expectation values and propagation on random
lattices. These calculations serve as an illustration of how far one can get
with present mathematical techniques. Although they result in detailed
predictions for the size of first quantum corrections such as the gamma-ray
burst effect, these predictions should not be taken too seriously because a)
the calculations are carried out at the kinematical level only and b) while we
can classify the amount of freedom in our constructions, the analysis of the
physical significance of possible choices has just begun.

gas is of current interest. We calculate the density matrix of that state in
two ways. The most effective method, in terms of yielding a simple, explicit
answer, is to construct a generating function within the traditional framework
of quantum statistical mechanics. The alternative method, arguably more
interesting, is to construct the thermal state as a vector state in an
artificial system with twice as many degrees of freedom. It is well known that
this construction has an actual physical realization in the quantum
thermodynamics of black holes, where the added degrees of freedom correspond to
the second sheet of the Kruskal manifold and the thermal vector state is a
state of the Unruh or the Hartle-Hawking type. What is unusual about the
present work is that the Bogolubov transformation used to construct the thermal
state combines in a rather symmetrical way with Bogolubov's original
transformation of the same form, used to implement the interaction of the
nonideal gas in linear approximation. In addition to providing a density
matrix, the method makes it possible to calculate efficiently certain
expectation values directly in terms of the thermal vector state of the doubled
system.

closed analytical form. But we need operator solutions of the equations of
motion corresponding to these models in order to study the quantum fluctuations
of coherent light in nonlinear media. In the present work we derive approximate
operator solutions. From these solutions we observe that there exists an
apparent discrepancy between the solutions obtained by different techniques. We
compare different solutions and conclude that all correct solutions are
equivalent and the apparent discrepancy is due to the use of different ordering

observing different optical phenomena in a nonlinear dielectric medium. To be
precise, we have studied quantum phase fluctuations of coherent light in a

tries to derive the Quantum Field Theory (QFT) on Curved Spacetimes (CST) limit
from background independent Quantum General Relativity (QGR). The constructions
of [1] make heavy use of the notion of semiclassical states for QGR. In the
present paper, we employ the complexifier coherent states for QGR recently
proposed by Thiemann and Winkler as semiclassical states, and thus fill the
general formulas obtained in [1] with life. We demonstrate how one can, under
some simplifying assumptions, explicitely compute expectation values of the
operators relevant for the gravity-matter Hamiltonians of [1] in the
complexifier coherent states. These expectation values give rise to effective
matter Hamiltonians on the background on which the gravitational coherent state
is peaked and thus induce approximate notions of n-particle states and matter
propagation on fluctuating spacetimes. We display the details for the scalar
and the electromagnetic field. The effective theories exhibit two types of
corrections as compared to the the ordinary QFT on CST. The first is due to the
quantum fluctuations of the gravitational field, the second arises from the
fact that background independence forces both geometry and matter to propagate
on a spacetime that is the product of the real line and a (random) graph.
Finally we obtain explicit numerical predictions for non-standard dispersion
relations for the scalar and the electromagnetic field. They should, however,
not be taken too seriously, due to the many ambiguities in our scheme, the
analysis of the physical significance of which has only begun. We show however,
that one can classify these ambiguities at least in broad terms.

  geometric phases</title><description>  We propose an experimentally feasible scheme to achieve quantum computation
based on nonadiabatic geometric phase shifts, in which a cyclic geometric phase
is used to realize a set of universal quantum gates. Physical implementation of
this set of gates is designed for Josephson junctions and for NMR systems.
Interestingly, we find that the nonadiabatic phase shift may be independent of
the operation time under appropriate controllable conditions. A remarkable
feature of the present nonadiabatic geometric gates is that there is no
intrinsic limitation on the operation time, unlike adiabatic geometric gates.
Besides fundamental interest, our results may simplify the implementation of
geometric quantum computation based on solid state systems, where the
decoherence time may be very short.

parametric down-conversion pumped by a ultrafast laser pulse exhibits strong
decoherence in its polarization entanglement, an effect which can be attributed
to the clock effect of the pump pulse or, equivalently, to distinguishing
spectral information in the two-photon state. Here, we propose novel temporal

effects. The temporal engineering of the two-photon wavefunction results in a
universal Bell-state synthesizer that is independent of the choice of pump
source, crystal parameters, wavelengths of the interacting photons, and the
bandwidth of the spectral filter. In the spectral engineering technique, the
distinguishing spectral features of the two-photon state are eliminated through
modifications to the two-photon source. In addition, spectral engineering also
provides a means for the generation of polarization-entangled states with novel
spectral characteristics: the frequency-correlated state and the

when the spacetime dependence of quantum phenomena is neglected. However the
transmission and processing of (quantum) information is a physical process in
spacetime. Therefore such basic notions in quantum information theory as qubit,
channel, composite systems and entangled states should be formulated in space
and time. In this paper some basic notions of quantum information theory are
considered from the point of view of quantum field theory and general
relativity. It is pointed out an important fact that in quantum field theory
there is a statistical dependence between two regions in spacetime even if they
are spacelike separated. A classical probabilistic representation for a family
of correlation functions in quantum field theory is obtained. A noncommutative
generalization of von Neumann`s spectral theorem is discussed. We suggest a new
physical principle describing a relation between the mathematical formalism of
Hilbert space and quantum physical phenomena which goes beyond the
superselection rules. Entangled states and the change of state associated with
the measurement process in space and time are discussed including the black
hole and the cosmological spacetime.
 It is shown that any reasonable state in relativistic quantum field theory
becomes disentangled at large spacelike distances if one makes local
observations. As a result a violation of Bell`s inequalities can be observed
without inconsistency with principles of relativistic quantum theory only if
the distance between detectors is rather small. We suggest a further
experimental study of entangled states in spacetime by studying the dependence
of the correlation functions on the distance between detectors.

Here is a point where quantum statistical mechanics and the local hidden

412, 295 (2001)], by focusing on the behavior of excitations or fluctuations
above the condensate, as driven by the dynamics of the condensate (rather than
the dynamics of the condensate alone or the kinetics of the atoms). The
dynamics of the condensate squeezes and amplifies the quantum excitations,
mixing the positive and negative frequency components of their wave functions
thereby creating particles which appear as bursts and jets. By analyzing the
changing amplitude and particle content of these excitations, our simple
physical picture (based on a test field approximation) explains well the
overall features of the Bose Novae phenomena and provide excellent quantitative
fits with experimental data on several aspects, such as the scaling behavior of
the collapse time and the amount of particles in the jet. The predictions of
the bursts at this level of approximation is less than satisfactory but may be
improved on by including the backreaction of the excitations on the condensate.
The mechanism behind the dominant effect -- parametric amplification of vacuum
fluctuations and freezing of modes outside of horizon -- is similar to that of
cosmological particle creation and structure formation in a rapid quench (which
is fundamentally different from Hawking radiation in black holes). This shows
that BEC dynamics is a promising venue for doing `laboratory cosmology'.

or time domain switch, the proposed switching mechanism is more scalable.
Assuming an n-by-n quantum switch, the space consumption grows linearly, i.e.
O(n), while the time complexity is O(1) for unicasting, and O(log n) for
multicasting. Based on these advantages, a high throughput switching device can
be built simply by increasing the number of I/O ports.

the capacities for entanglement creation and bidirectional communication

  free quantum particle</title><description>  The long time behaviour of the survival probability of initial state and its
dependence on the initial states are considered, for the one dimensional free
quantum particle. We derive the asymptotic expansion of the time evolution
operator at long times, in terms of the integral operators. This enables us to
obtain the asymptotic formula for the survival probability of the initial state
$\psi (x)$, which is assumed to decrease sufficiently rapidly at large $|x|$.
We then show that the behaviour of the survival probability at long times is
determined by that of the initial state $\psi$ at zero momentum $k=0$. Indeed,
it is proved that the survival probability can exhibit the various power-decays
like $t^{-2m-1}$ for an arbitrary non-negative integers $m$ as $t \to \infty $,
corresponding to the initial states with the condition $\hat{\psi} (k) =

superposition of N+1 box locations and which is subject to a final
``post-selection'' measurement corresponding to a different superposition can
be said to have occupied ``with certainty'' N boxes during the intervening
time. However, others have argued that under closer inspection, this surprising
claim fails to hold. Aharonov and Vaidman have continued their advocacy of the
claim in question by proposing a variation on the N-box experiment, in which
the boxes are replaced by shutters and the pre- and post-selected particle is
entangled with a photon. These authors argue that the resulting ``N-shutter
experiment'' strengthens their original claim regarding the N-box experiment.
It is argued in this paper that the apparently surprising features of this
variation are no more robust than those of the N-box experiment and that it is
not accurate to say that the particle is ``with certainty'' in all N shutters
at any given time.

  New Approach to the Casimir Problem</title><description>  The Casimir problem is usually posed as the response of a fluctuating quantum
field to externally imposed boundary conditions. In reality, however, no
interaction is strong enough to enforce a boundary condition on all frequencies
of a fluctuating field. We construct a more physical model of the situation by
coupling the fluctuating field to a smooth background potential that implements
the boundary condition in a certain limit. To study this problem, we develop
general new methods to compute renormalized one--loop quantum energies and
energy densities. We use analytic properties of scattering data to compute
Green's functions in time--independent background fields at imaginary momenta.
Our calculational method is particularly useful for numerical studies of
singular limits because it avoids terms that oscillate or require cancellation
of exponentially growing and decaying factors. To renormalize, we identify
potentially divergent contributions to the Casimir energy with low orders in
the Born series to the Green's function. We subtract these contributions and
add back the corresponding Feynman diagrams, which we combine with counterterms
fixed by imposing standard renormalization conditions on low--order Green's
functions. The resulting Casimir energy and energy density are finite
functionals for smooth background potentials. In general, however, the Casimir
energy diverges in the boundary condition limit. This divergence is real and
reflects the infinite energy needed to constrain a fluctuating field on all
energy scales; renormalizable quantum field theories have no place for ad hoc
surface counterterms. We apply our methods to simple examples to illustrate
cases where these subtleties invalidate the conclusions of the boundary
condition approach.

  Constrained Quantization on the SU(2) and SO(3) manifolds</title><description>  In the Skyrme model, the Lagrangian can be quantized in several ways using
the collective coordinate approach. Not all of which produce quantum states
that can be interpreted as physical particles. For example the SU(2) collective
coordinate approach produces both integral and half-integral spin and isospin
states. Only half of these are the physical baryons. Less well known is the
fact that it is equally possible to quantize the system using the SO(3)
collective coordinates. This produces only unphysical integral spin and isospin
states. To fulfill the goal of being able to express a classical skyrmion as a
coherent state of baryons directly in terms of the baryon states, surprisingly
a combination of both collective coordinate approaches is required. To prepare
for the subsequent application to skyrmion formation through disoriented chiral
condensates in heavy ion collisions, the Skyrme model is rigorously quantized
using the Dirac prescription for constrained systems. This is shown for both
the SU(2) as well as the SO(3) collective coordinate approach.

relation of a classical skyrmion to baryon states is examined. It is argued
that a skyrmion is a coherent state of baryons. The collective coordinate
approach of quantization means that the physical baryon states exist not in
flat space but on a compact manifold. This requires the construction of
coherent states in such a curve space. Using the techniques associated with the
Segal-Bargmann transform also known as the coherent state transform used for
example in the study of the classical limit of quantum gravity, such states can
be constructed in the context of the Skyrme model. They are made up directly of
baryon states on S^3 but with quantum operators on the SO(3) manifold. In terms
of wavefunctions, they are a superposition of the analytic baryon wavefunctions
of Adkins, Nappi and Witten. The distribution of the baryon states in terms of
the relative probabilities of the baryons inside a skyrmion can therefore be
determined.

Ising model (RBIM). The model is a pure Z_2 gauge theory in which randomly
chosen plaquettes (occuring with concentration p) have couplings with the
``wrong sign'' so that magnetic flux is energetically favored on these
plaquettes. Excitations of the model are one-dimensional ``flux tubes'' that
terminate at ``magnetic monopoles.'' Electric confinement can be driven by
thermal fluctuations of the flux tubes, by the quenched background of magnetic
monopoles, or by a combination of the two. Like the RBIM, the RPGM has enhanced
symmetry along a ``Nishimori line'' in the p-T plane (where T is the
temperature). The critical concentration p_c of wrong-sign plaquettes at the
confinement-Higgs phase transition along the Nishimori line can be identified
with the accuracy threshold for robust storage of quantum information using
topological error-correcting codes: if qubit phase errors, qubit bit-flip
errors, and errors in the measurement of local check operators all occur at
rates below p_c, then encoded quantum information can be protected perfectly
from damage in the limit of a large code block. Numerically, we measure p_{c0},
the critical concentration along the T=0 axis (a lower bound on p_c), finding
p_{c0}=.0293 +/- .0002. We also measure the critical concentration of
antiferromagnetic bonds in the two-dimensional RBIM on the T=0 axis, finding

share of qubits underwent a depolarization channel; in the fidelity model, the
only information Alice and Bob possess is the fidelity of the shared state.
  For the measure-r model and the depolarization model, we prove tight and
almost-tight bounds on the outcome of LOCC protocols that don't use
communication. For the fidelity model, we prove a lower bound on the
communication complexity that matches the upper bound given by Ambainis, Smith,

with a coherently prepared molecular Raman medium. We describe a general
formalism which includes dispersive effects, such as group velocity and group
velocity dispersion (GVD). When dispersion is negligible, the analysis is
especially simple and insightful. We show that molecular oscillations result in
a modulated instantaneous susceptibility of the medium. The effect of the
time-varying susceptibility on a probe laser pulse is two-fold: the output
frequency becomes modulated because of the time-varying phase velocity, and the
pulse shape becomes deformed because of the time-varying group velocity. We
identify two mechanisms for pulse compression: (1) Frequency chirping with
subsequent pulse compression by normal linear GVD (possibly in the same medium)
and (2) Compression due to the time-varying group velocity. We analyze various
aspects of pulse compression in the coherent Raman medium and derive
conservation relations for this process. When we consider a probe laser pulse
which is much shorter than the molecular oscillation period, we observe
frequency chirping, compression, or stretching of this pulse, depending on its
relative timing with respect to the molecular oscillations. Based on our
analysis, we propose a method for selective compression or frequency conversion
of single ultrashort pulses.

how it gives rise to consciousness. Quantum mechanics is believed to be capable
of explaining the enigma of conscious experience, however till now there is not
good enough model considering both the data from clinical neurology and having
some explanatory power. In this paper is presented a novel model in defence of
macroscopic quantum events within and between neural cells. The synaptic
beta-neurexin/neuroligin-1 adhesive protein complex is claimed to be not just
the core of the excitatory glutamatergic CNS synapse, instead it is a device
mediating entanglement between the cytoskeletons of the cortical neurons. Thus
the macroscopic coherent quantum state can extend throughout large brain
cortical areas and the subsequent collapse of the wavefunction could affect
simultaneously the subneuronal events in millions of neurons. The
neuroligin-1/beta-neurexin/synaptotagmin-1 complex also controls the process of
exocytosis and provides an interesting and simple mechanism for retrograde
signalling during learning-dependent changes in synaptic connectivity. A brief
outlook of the molecular machinery driving neuromediator release through
exocytosis is provided with particular emphasis on the possibility for
vibrationally-assisted tunneling.

models to the presence of chaos in the associated classical models. We
demonstrate that a system's rate of fidelity decay under repeated perturbations
may be measured efficiently on a quantum information processor, and analyze the
conditions under which this indicator is a reliable probe of quantum chaos and
related statistical properties of the unperturbed system. The type and rate of
the decay are not dependent on the eigenvalue statistics of the unperturbed
system, but depend on the system's eigenvector statistics in the eigenbasis of
the perturbation operator. For random eigenvector statistics the decay is
exponential with a rate fixed precisely by the variance of the perturbation's
energy spectrum. Hence, even classically regular models can exhibit an
exponential fidelity decay under generic quantum perturbations. These results
clarify which perturbations can distinguish classically regular and chaotic
quantum systems.

on its own rather than `quantization' of an underlying classical theory. It is
proposed that the unification of probability and dynamics should be considered
as the basic feature of quantum theory. Arguments are given to show that when
such a unification is attempted at the configuration space level, the wave
funtions of Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger theory appear as the natural candidates for
the desired unification. A *-algebra $\mathcal{A}_{Q}$ of (not necessarily
bounded) linear operators acting on an appropriate dense set of these wave
functions appears as the arena for quantum kinematics. A simple generalization
of an existing formalism in noncommutative geometry is employed to develop the
notion of generalized algebraic symplectic structure (GASS) which can
accomodate classical and quantum symplectic structures as special cases.
Quantum kinematics and dynamics is developed in in the framework of a
noncommutative Hamiltonian system employing an appropriate GASS based in $
\mathcal{A}_{Q}$. The Planck constant is introduced at only one place -- in the
quantum symplectic form; its appearance at conventional places is then
automatic. Unitary Wigner symmetries appear as canonical transformations in the
noncommutative Hamiltonian system. A straightforward treatment of quantum -
classical correspondence is given in terms of appropriate GASSes.

appropriate for absorbing systems and a convenient compact form of the Green
function for a multilayer, a straightforward and transparent derivation of the
Casimir force in a lossless layer of an otherwise absorbing multilayer is
presented. The resulting expression in terms of the reflection coefficients of
the surrounding stacks of layers is of the same form as that obtained by Zhou

summation method [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 52}, 297 (1995)]. Owing to the recursion
relations which the generalized Fresnel coefficients satisfy, this result can
be applied to more complex systems with planar symmetry. This is illustrated by
calculating the Casimir force on a dielectric (metallic) slab in a planar
cavity with realistic mirrors. Also, a relationship between the Casimir force

including large block codes and concatenated codes. Recent insights into the
syndrome extraction process, which render the whole process more efficient and
more noise-tolerant, are incorporated. The average number of recoveries which
can be completed without failure is thus estimated as a function of various
parameters. The main parameters are the gate (gamma) and memory (epsilon)
failure rates, the physical scale-up of the computer size, and the time t_m
required for measurements and classical processing. The achievable computation
size is given as a surface in parameter space. This indicates the noise
threshold as well as other information. It is found that concatenated codes
based on the [[23,1,7]] Golay code give higher thresholds than those based on

gamma_0 is a function of epsilon/gamma and t_m; example values are

a position measurement and the momentum disturbance caused by that measurement
should be no less than the limit set by Planck's constant, hbar/2, as
demonstrated by Heisenberg's thought experiment using a gamma-ray microscope.
Here I show that this common assumption is false: a universally valid trade-off
relation between the noise and the disturbance has an additional correlation
term, which is redundant when the intervention brought by the measurement is
independent of the measured object, but which allows the noise-disturbance
product much below Planck's constant when the intervention is dependent. A
model of measuring interaction with dependent intervention shows that
Heisenberg's lower bound for the noise-disturbance product is violated even by
a nearly nondisturbing, precise position measuring instrument. An experimental
implementation is also proposed to realize the above model in the context of
optical quadrature measurement with currently available linear optical devices.

become entangled through interaction with a thermalized partner? We address
this question here. In particular, we consider the question of how mixed a
two-level system and a field mode may be such that free entanglement arises in
the course of the time evolution according to a Jaynes-Cummings type
interaction. We investigate the situation for which the two-level system is
initially in mixed state taken from a one-parameter set, whereas the field has
been prepared in an arbitrary thermal state. Depending on the particular choice
for the initial state and the initial temperature of the quantised field mode,
three cases can be distinguished: (i) free entanglement will be created
immediately,
  (ii) free entanglement will be generated, but only at a later time different
from zero, (iii) the partial transpose of the joint state remains positive at
all times. It will be demonstrated that increasing the initial temperature of
the field mode may cause the joint state to become distillable during the time
evolution, in contrast to a non-distillable state at lower initial
temperatures. We further assess the generated entanglement quantitatively, by
evaluating the logarithmic negativity numerically, and by providing an
analytical upper bound.

Renyi's and Tsallis' measures constitute particular instances of these

investigate these tools in the context of integrable systems to which these
techniques have not been previously applied. Our specific model is a
stroboscopic map of an integrable Hamiltonian system with quadratic action
dependence, for which each stage of the semiclassical approximation can be
controlled. It is found that large errors occur in the semiclassical traces due
to edge corrections which may be neglected if the eigenvalues are obtained by
Fourier transformation over the long time dynamics. However, these errors cause
serious harm to the spectral approximations of an integrable system obtained
via the spectral determinants. The symmetry property of the spectral
determinant does not generally alleviate the error, since it sometimes sheds a

with respect to the group of local transformations. What aspects of the study
of entanglement are applicable to generalized coherent states? Conversely, what
can be learned about entanglement from the well-studied theory of coherent
states? With these questions in mind, we characterize unentangled pure states
as extremal states when considered as linear functionals on the local Lie
algebra. As a result, a relativized notion of purity emerges, showing that
there is a close relationship between purity, coherence and (non-)entanglement.
To a large extent, these concepts can be defined and studied in the even more
general setting of convex cones of states. Based on the idea that entanglement
is relative, we suggest considering these notions in the context of partially
ordered families of Lie algebras or convex cones, such as those that arise
naturally for multipartite systems. The study of entanglement includes notions
of local operations and, for information-theoretic purposes, entanglement
measures and ways of scaling systems to enable asymptotic developments. We
propose ways in which these may be generalized to the Lie-algebraic setting,
and to a lesser extent to the convex-cones setting. One of our original
motivations for this program is to understand the role of entanglement-like

theories can be described, in the Heisenberg picture, as a linear combination
of randomly distributed incoherent paths that obey classical equations of

&quot;pseudoclassical&quot; paths and use them to define the dynamics of quantum
fluctuations. Every physical observable is assigned a time-dependent value on
each path in a way that respects the uncertainty principle, but in consequence,
some of the standard algebraic relations between quantum observables are not
necessarily fulfilled by their time-dependent values on paths. We define
&quot;collective observables&quot; which depend on a large number of independent degrees
of freedom, and show that the dynamics of their quantum fluctuations can be
described in terms of unconstrained classical stochastic processes without
reference to any additional external system or to an environment. Our analysis
can be generalized to states other than the vacuum. Finally, we compare our
formalism to the formalism of coherent states, and highlight their differences.

  double electromagnetically induced transparency regime</title><description>  The generation of an entangled coherent state is one of the most important
ingredients of quantum information processing using coherent states. Recently,
numerous schemes to achieve this task have been proposed. In order to generate
travelling-wave entangled coherent states, cross phase modulation, optimized by
optical Kerr effect enhancement in a dense medium in an electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT) regime, seems to be very promising. In this
scenario, we propose a fully quantized model of a double-EIT scheme recently
proposed [D. Petrosyan and G. Kurizki, {\sl Phys. Rev. A} {\bf 65}, 33833
(2002)]: the quantization step is performed adopting a fully Hamiltonian
approach. This allows us to write effective equations of motion for two
interacting quantum fields of light that show how the dynamics of one field
depends on the photon-number operator of the other. The preparation of a
Schr\&quot;odinger cat state, which is a superposition of two distinct coherent
states, is briefly exposed. This is based on non-linear interaction via
double-EIT of two light fields (initially prepared in coherent states) and on a
detection step performed using a $50:50$ beam splitter and two photodetectors.
In order to show the entanglement of a generated entangled coherent state, we
suggest to measure the joint quadrature variance of the field. We show that the
entangled coherent states satisfy the sufficient condition for entanglement
based on quadrature variance measurement. We also show how robust our scheme is
against a low detection efficiency of homodyne detectors.

the methods of statistical dynamics. We develop the concept of a strictly
contractive quantum channel in order to construct mathematical models of
physically realizable, i.e., nonideal, quantum registers and computers.
Strictly contractive channels are simple enough, yet exhibit very interesting
features, which are meaningful from the physical point of view. In particular,
they allow us to incorporate the crucial assumption of finite precision of all
experimentally realizable operations. Strict contractivity also helps us gain
insight into the thermodynamics of noisy quantum evolutions (approach to
equilibrium). Our investigation into thermodynamics focuses on the
entropy-energy balance in quantum registers and computers under the influence
of strictly contractive noise. Using entropy-energy methods, we are able to
appraise the thermodynamical resources needed to maintain reliable operation of
the computer. We also obtain estimates of the largest tolerable error rate.
Finally, we explore the possibility of going beyond the standard circuit model
of error correction, namely constructing quantum memory devices on the basis of
interacting particle systems at low temperatures.

is also shown that, with sharing EPR pairs a priori, the class of languages
having one-sided bounded error non-interactive quantum perfect zero-knowledge

system is based on the fact proved in this paper that the Graph

zero-knowledge proofs secure even against dishonest quantum verifiers, since
our protocols are non-interactive, and thus the zero-knowledge property does
not depend on whether the verifier in the protocol is honest or not. A

decaying 2-level atom. Using the integral-sum kernel approach to quantum
stochastic calculus we couple the 2-level atom to an environment, which in our
case will be interpreted as the electromagnetic field. The irreversible time
evolution of the 2-level atom then stems from the reversible time evolution of
atom and field together. Mathematically speaking, we have constructed a Markov
dilation of the semigroup. The next step is to drive the atom by a laser and to
count the photons emitted into the field by the decaying 2-level atom. For
every possible sequence of photon counts we construct a map that gives the time
evolution of the 2-level atom inferred by that sequence. The family of maps
that we obtain in this way forms a so-called Davies process. In his book Davies
describes the structure of these processes, which brings us into the field of
quantum trajectories. Within our model we calculate the jump operators and we

basics of implementing quantum algorithms. We describe how qubits are realized
and controlled with RF pulses, their internal interactions, and gradient
fields. A peculiarity of NMR is that the internal interactions (given by the
internal Hamiltonian) are always on. We discuss how they can be effectively
turned off with the help of a standard NMR method called ``refocusing''. Liquid
state NMR experiments are done at room temperature, leading to an extremely
mixed (that is, nearly random) initial state. Despite this high degree of
randomness, it is possible to investigate QIP because the relaxation time (the
time scale over which useful signal from a computation is lost) is sufficiently
long. We explain how this feature leads to the crucial ability of simulating a
pure (non-random) state by using ``pseudopure'' states. We discuss how the
``answer'' provided by a computation is obtained by measurement and how this
measurement differs from the ideal, projective measurement of QIP. We then give
implementations of some simple quantum algorithms with a typical experimental
result. We conclude with a discussion of what we have learned from NMR QIP so
far and what the prospects for future NMR QIP experiments are.

consistency criterion for histories of quantum events. It is shown that
``strange'' weak values for projection operators (such as values less than
zero) always correspond to inconsistent families of histories. It is argued
that using the ABL rule to obtain probabilities for counterfactual measurements
corresponding to those strange weak values gives inconsistent results. This
problem is shown to be remedied by using the conditional weight, or
pseudo-probability, obtained from the multiple-time application of Luders'
Rule. It is argued that an assumption of reverse causality (a form of time
symmetry) implies that weak values obtain, in a restricted sense, at the time
of the weak measurement as well as at the time of post-selection. Finally, it
is argued that weak values are more appropriately characterised as
multiple-time amplitudes than expectation values, and as such can have little
to say about counterfactual questions.

computation consisting only of one-qubit measurements on a particular entangled
multi-qubit state, the cluster state. The computational model underlying the
QCc is different from the quantum logic network model and it is based on

quantum gates. The QCc is nevertheless quantum mechanical since it uses a
highly entangled cluster state as the central physical resource. The scheme
works by measuring quantum correlations of the universal cluster state.

in opposite directions with respect to macroscopic time. In this paper we show
that ensembles of entwined paths on a discrete space-time lattice are simply
described by coupled difference equations which are discrete versions of the
Dirac equation. There is no analytic continuation, explicit or forced, involved
in this description. The entwined paths are `self-quantizing'. We also show
that simple classical stochastic processes that generate the difference
equations as ensemble averages are stable numerically and converge at a rate
governed by the details of the stochastic process. This result establishes the
Dirac equation in one dimension as a phenomenological equation describing an
underlying classical stochastic process in the same sense that the Diffusion

to build scalable quantum computers, it appears that simulation of quantum
computation will be at least as critical as circuit simulation in classical
VLSI design. However, since the work of Richard Feynman in the early 1980s
little progress was made in practical quantum simulation. Most researchers
focused on polynomial-time simulation of restricted types of quantum circuits
that fall short of the full power of quantum computation. Simulating quantum
computing devices and useful quantum algorithms on classical hardware now
requires excessive computational resources, making many important simulation
tasks infeasible. In this work we propose a new technique for gate-level
simulation of quantum circuits which greatly reduces the difficulty and cost of
such simulations. The proposed technique is implemented in a simulation tool
called the Quantum Information Decision Diagram (QuIDD) and evaluated by
simulating Grover's quantum search algorithm. The back-end of our package,
QuIDD Pro, is based on Binary Decision Diagrams, well-known for their ability
to efficiently represent many seemingly intractable combinatorial structures.
This reliance on a well-established area of research allows us to take
advantage of existing software for BDD manipulation and achieve unparalleled
empirical results for quantum simulation.

  drugs in clinical trials</title><description>  To test the effectiveness of a drug one can advice two randomly selected
groups of patients to take or not to take it, respectively. It is well-known
that the causal effect cannot be identified if not all patients comply. This
holds even when the non-compliers can be identified afterwards since latent
factors like patient's personality can influence both his decision and his
physical response. However, one can still give bounds on the effectiveness of
the drug depending on the rate of compliance. Remarkably, the proofs of these
bounds given in the literature rely on models that represent all relevant
latent factors (including noise) by hidden classical variables. In strong
analogy to the violation of Bell's inequality, some of these bounds fail if
patient's behavior is influenced by latent quantum processes (e.g. in his
nervous system). Quantum effects could fake an increase of the recovery rate by
about 13% although the drug would hurt as many patients as it would help if
everyone took it. The other bounds are true even in the quantum case.
  We do not present any realistic model showing this effect, we only point out
that the physics of decision making could be relevant for the causal
interpretation of every-day life statistical data.

describes the rapid evolution of a superposition of macroscopically
distinguishable states to one of them. This provides a phenomenological basis
for a physical resolution to the so-called &quot;measurement problem.&quot; Such models
have experimentally testable differences from standard quantum theory. The most
well developed such model at present is the Continuous Spontaneous Localization
(CSL) model in which a fluctuating classical field interacts with particles to
cause collapse. One &quot;side effect&quot; of this interaction is that the field imparts
momentum to particles, causing a small blob of matter to undergo random walk.
Here we explore this in order to supply predictions which could be
experimentally tested. We examine the translational diffusion of a sphere and a
disc, and the rotational diffusion of a disc, according to CSL. For example, we
find that a disc of radius 2 cdot 10^{-5} cm and thickness 0.5 cdot 10^{-5} cm
diffuses through 2 pi rad in about 70sec (this assumes the &quot;standard&quot; CSL
parameter values). The comparable rms diffusion of standard quantum theory is
smaller than this by a factor 10^-3. At the reported pressure of &lt; 5
cdot10^{-17} Torr, achieved at 4.2^{circ} K, the mean time between air molecule
collisions with the disc is approximately 45min (and the diffusion caused by
photon collisons is utterly negligible). This is ample time for observation of
the putative CSL diffusion over a wide range of parameters.
  This encourages consideration of how such an experiment may actually be
performed, and the paper closes with some thoughts on this subject

indistinguishable quarticle the PII is violated but that for distinguishable
quarticles there are states in which it is violated by any pair of particles,
states in which it is violated only by some pairs of particles and states in
which it is violated by no pairs of particles. The updated version corrects a
minor statement of mathematical fact, and provides a short proof for a

  Effect and Supersymmetry</title><description>  The original topological Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect is due to the
interaction of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment (MDM) with certain
configurations of electric field. Naively one would not expect an AC effect for
a scalar particle for which no anomalous MDM can be defined in the usual sense.
In this letter we study the AC effect in supersymmetric systems. In this
framework there is the possibility of deducing the AC effect of a scalar
particle from the corresponding effect for a spinor particle. In 3+1 dimensions
such a connection is not possible because the anomalous MDM is zero if
supersymmetry is an exact symmetry. However, in 2+1 dimensions it is possible
to have an anomalous MDM even with exact supersymmetry.
  Having demonstrated the relationship between the spinor and the scalar MDM,
we proceed to show that the scalar AC effect is uniquely defined. We then
compute the anomalous MDM at the one loop level, showing how the scalar form
arises in 2+1 dimensions from the coupling of the scalar to spinors. This model
shows how an AC effect for a scalar can be generated for non-supersymmetric
theories, and we construct such a model to illustrate the mechanism.

  applications</title><description>  Characterizing entanglement in all but the simplest case of a two qubit pure
state is a hard problem, even understanding the relevant experimental
quantities that are related to entanglement is difficult. It may not be
necessary, however, to quantify the entanglement of a state in order to
quantify the quantum information processing significance of a state. It is
known that the fully entangled fraction has a direct relationship to the
fidelity of teleportation maximized under the actions of local unitary
operations. In the case of two qubits we point out that the fully entangled
fraction can also be related to the fidelities, maximized under the actions of
local unitary operations, of other important quantum information tasks such as
dense coding, entanglement swapping and quantum cryptography in such a way as
to provide an inclusive measure of these entanglement applications. For two
qubit systems the fully entangled fraction has a simple known closed-form
expression and we establish lower and upper bounds of this quantity with the
concurrence. This approach is readily extendable to more complicated systems.

order in the fine structure constant alpha and in the small h-bar

Lorentz-Dirac formula for the radiation-reaction force, and that it agrees with
the classical theory if one assumes that the particle loses its energy to
radiation at each moment of time according to the Larmor formula in the static
frame of the potential. However, the discrepancy is much smaller than the
Compton wavelength of the particle. We also point out that the electromagnetic
correction to the potential has no classical limit. (Correction. Surface terms
were erroneously discarded to arrive at Eq. (59). By correcting this error we
find that the position shift according to the Lorentz-Dirac theory obtained
from Eq. (12) is reproduced by quantum field theory in the hbar -&gt; 0 limit. We
also find that the small V(z) approximation is unnecessary for this agreement.

a new model for the efficient generation and use of variable length codes. In
this picture lossless data compression can be seen as the {\em minimum energy}
required to faithfully represent or transmit classical information contained
within a quantum state.
  In order to represent information we create quanta in some predefined modes
(i.e. frequencies) prepared in one of two possible internal states (the
information carrying degrees of freedom). Data compression is now seen as the
selective annihilation of these quanta, the energy of whom is effectively
dissipated into the environment. As any increase in the energy of the
environment is intricately linked to any information loss and is subject to
Landauer's erasure principle, we use this principle to distinguish lossless and
lossy schemes and to suggest bounds on the efficiency of our lossless
compression protocol.
  In line with the work of Bostr\&quot;{o}m and Felbinger \cite{bostroem}, we also
show that when using variable length codes the classical notions of prefix or
uniquely decipherable codes are unnecessarily restrictive given the structure
of quantum mechanics and that a 1-1 mapping is sufficient. In the absence of
this restraint we translate existing classical results on 1-1 coding to the
quantum domain to derive a new upper bound on the compression of quantum
information. Finally we present a simple quantum circuit to implement our
scheme.

band gap states of silicon can influence charge carrier recombination. Based on
this effect, a readout concept for silicon based solid-state spin--quantum
computers as proposed by Kane is suggested. The 31P quantum bit (qbit) is
connected via hyperfine coupling to the spin of the localized donor electron.
When a second localized and singly occupied electronic state with an energy
level deep within the band gap or close to the valence edge is in proximity, a
gate controlled exchange between the 31P nucleus and the two electronic states
can be activated that leaves the donor-deep level pair either unchanged in a
|T-&gt;-state or shifts it into a singlet state |S&gt;. Since the donor deep level
transition is spin-dependent, the deep level becomes charged or not, depending
on the nuclear spin orientation of the donor nucleus. Thus, the state of the
qbit can be read with a sequence of light pulses and photo conductivity
measurements.

every system then the scalar product cannot be positive definite. Identifying
the one-forms with the Jacobi fields we provide a physical explanation of these

efficiency of coherence or polarization transfer between two spins in the
presence of relaxation. Furthermore, what is the optimal pulse sequence which
achieves this efficiency? In this letter, we initiate the study of a class of

a non-Markovian quantum Kramers' equation to derive the quantum rate
coefficient for barrier crossing due to thermal activation and tunneling in the

to weak friction regime to derive quantum Kramers' equation in energy space and
the rate of decay from a metastable well. The theory is valid for arbitrary

golden rule regime to the perturbation-independent exponential decay regime by
using the kicked top model. It is shown that the deviation of the
perturbation-independent decay of the averaged fidelity from the Lyapunov decay
results from quantum fluctuations in individual fidelity, which are caused by
the coherence in the initial coherent states.
 With an averaging procedure suppressing the quantum fluctuations effectively,
the perturbation-independent decay is found to be close to the Lyapunov decay.
 We also show that the Fourier transform of the fidelity is determined directly
by the initial state and the eigenstates of the Floquet operators of the two
classically chaotic systems concerned.
 The absolute value part and the phase part of the Fourier transform of the
fidelity are found to be divided into several correlated parts, which is a
manifestation of the coherence of the initial coherent state.
 In the whole crossover region, some important properties of the fidelity, such
as the exponent of its exponential decay and the short initial time within
which the fidelity almost does not change, are found to be closely related to
properties of the central part of its Fourier transform.

quantum mind advocates proposed experiments based on the assumption that the

preserved through the neural processing, or in other words they suppose that
photons collapse not in the retina, but in the brain cortex. In this paper we
show that photons do collapse within the retina and subsequent processing of
information at the level of neural membranes proceeds. Moreover, we explicitly
stress on the fact that due to existent amplification of the signal produced by
each photon, a basic quantum mechanical theorem forbids the photon state to be
teleported from the retina to the brain cortex. The changes of the membrane
potential of the neurons in the primary visual cortex are shown to be relevant
to inputting visual sensory information that is already processed and is not
identical to the visual image entering in the retina. A striking evidence for
the existent processing of the incoming visual information by the retina is
provided by visual illusions resulting from the lateral inhibition mechanism.

completeness of quantum mechanics (QM) started by Einstein more than 70 years
ago. Many years ago we pointed out that the violation of Bell's inequalities is
neither a proof of completeness of QM nor an indication of the violation of
Einsteinian causality. We also indicated how and in what sense a completeness
of QM might be tested with the help of statistical nonparametric purity tests.
In this paper we review and refine our arguments. We also point out that the
statistical predictions of QM for two-particle correlation experiments do not
give any deterministic prediction for a single pair. After beam is separated we
obtain two beams moving in opposite directions. If the coincidence is reported
it is only after the beams had interacted with corresponding measuring devices
and two particles had been detected. This fact has implications for quantum
cryptography. Namely a series of the measurements performed on the beam by Bob
and converted into a string of bits (secret key) will in general differ, due to
lack of strict anti-correlations, from a secret key found by Alice using the
same procedure.

LDCs with 2 classical queries need exponential length: m=2^{Omega(n)}.
Previously this was known only for linear codes (Goldreich et al. 02). Our

transition for a system with coupled internal (spin) and external (motional)
degrees of freedom. Even when the measured motional degree of freedom can be
treated classically, entanglement between spin and motion causes strong
measurement backaction on the quantum spin subsystem so that classical
trajectories are not recovered in this mixed quantum-classical regime. The
measurement can extract localized quantum trajectories that behave classically
only when the internal action also becomes large relative to h-bar.

  basis</title><description>  We discuss what can be inferred from measurements on one- and two-qubit
systems using a single measurement basis at various times. We show that, given
reasonable physical assumptions, carrying out such measurements at
quarter-period intervals is enough to demonstrate coherent oscillations of one
or two qubits between the relevant measurement basis states. One can thus infer
from such measurements alone that an approximately equal superposition of two
measurement basis states has been created in a coherent oscillation experiment.
Similarly, one can infer that a near maximally entangled state of two qubits
has been created in an experiment involving a putative SWAP gate. These results
apply even if the relevant quantum systems are only approximate qubits. We
discuss applications to fundamental quantum physics experiments and quantum
information processing investigations.

  Development &amp; Related Topics</title><description>  We postulate that consciousness is intrinsically connected to quantum spin
since the latter is the origin of quantum effects in both Bohm and Hestenes
quantum formulisms and a fundamental quantum process associated with the
structure of space-time. Applying these ideas to the particular structures and
dynamics of the brain, we have developed a detailed model of quantum
consciousness. We have also carried out experiments from the perspective of our
theory to test the possibility of quantum-entangling the quantum entities
inside the brain with those of an external chemical substance. We found that
applying magnetic pulses to the brain when an anaesthetic was placed in between
caused the brain to feel the effect of said anaesthetic as if the test subject
had actually inhaled the same. We further found that drinking water exposed to
magnetic pulses, laser light or microwave when an anaesthetic was placed in
between also causes brain effects in various degrees. Additional experiments
indicate that the said brain effect is indeed the consequence of quantum
entanglement. Recently we have studied non-local effects in simple physics
systems. We have found that the pH value, temperature and gravity of a liquid
in the detecting reservoirs can be non-locally affected through manipulating
another liquid in a remote reservoir quantum-entangled with the former. In
particular, the pH value changes in the same direction as that being
manipulated; the temperature can change against that of local environment; and
the gravity can change against local gravity. We suggest that they are mediated
by quantum entanglement between nuclear and/or electron spins in treated liquid
and discuss the profound implications of these results. This paper now also
includes materials on further development of the theory and related topics.

the simplest mathematically rigourous and physically plausible model for the
reduction of the wave function. In this article we apply a new simulation
methodology for the stochastic framework to analyse formulae for the dynamics
of a particle confined to a square-well potential. We consider the situation
when the width of the well is expanded instantaneously. Through this example we
are able to illustrate in detail how a quantum system responds to an energy

by which the system relaxes spontaneously into one of the stable eigenstates of
the Hamiltonian. We examine in particular how the expectation value of the
Hamiltonian and the probability distribution for the position of the particle
change in time. An analytic expression for the typical timescale of relaxation
is derived. We also consider the small perturbation limit, and discuss the

Hermitian Hamiltonians is overly restrictive. A consistent physical theory of
quantum mechanics can be built on a complex Hamiltonian that is not Hermitian
but satisfies the less restrictive and more physical condition of space-time
reflection symmetry (PT symmetry). Thus, there are infinitely many new
Hamiltonians that one can construct to explain experimental data. One might
expect that a quantum theory based on a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian would violate
unitarity. However, if PT symmetry is not spontaneously broken, it is possible
to construct a previously unnoticed physical symmetry C of the Hamiltonian.
Using C, an inner product is constructed whose associated norm is positive
definite. This construction is completely general and works for any
PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. Observables exhibit CPT symmetry, and the dynamics is
governed by unitary time evolution. This work is not in conflict with
conventional quantum mechanics but is rather a complex generalisation of it.

application. For this purpose quantum retrodiction in open systems should be
more relevant than in closed systems isolated from the environment. In this

interpretation is reconsidered from the modern point of view of quantum
stochastics and information. It is argued that in the orthodox quantum
mechanics there is no place for quantum phenomenology such as events. The
development of quantum measurement theory, initiated by von Neumann, and Bell's
conceptual critics of hidden variable theories indicated a possibility for
resolution of this crisis. This can be done by divorcing the algebra of the
dynamical generators and an extended algebra of the potential (quantum) and the
actual (classical) observables. The latter, called beables, form the center of
the algebra of all observables, as the only visible (macroscopic) observables
must be compatible with any hidden (microscopic) observable.
  It is shown that within this approach quantum causality can be rehabilitated
within event enhanced quantum mechanics (eventum mechanics) in the form of a
superselection rule for compatibility of the consistent histories with the
statistically predictable future. The application of this rule in the form of
the nondemolition principle leads to the statistical inference of the von
Neumann projection postulate, and also to the more general quantum information
dynamics for instantaneous events, spontaneous localizations (i.e. quantum
jumps), and state diffusions (i.e. continuous trajectories). This gives a
dynamical solution, in the form of a Dirac boundary value problem and reduced
filtering equations, of the notorious decoherence and measurement problems
which was tackled unsuccessfully by many famous mathematicians and physicists
starting with von Neumann, Schroedinger and Bohr.

no classical probabilistic analogue. Having complex phases as primitive
ingredient implies that we need to accept non-additive probabilities. This has
the desirable consequence of removing constraints of standard theorems about
the possibility of describing quantum theory with commutative variables.
Motivated by the formalism of consistent histories and keeping an analogy with
the theory of stochastic processes, we develop a (statistical) theory of
quantum processes. They are characterised by the introduction of a &quot;density
matrix&quot; on phase space paths -thus including phase information- and fully
reproduce quantum mechanical predictions. In this framework wecan write quantum
differential equations, that could be interpreted as referring to a single
system (in analogy to Langevin's equation). We describe a reconstruction
theorem by which a quantum process can yield the standard Hilbert space
structure if the Markov property is imposed. Finally, we discuss the relevance

operator in an open quantum system. An expression for the rate of change of the
Wigner function as a sum of integrals is one of the forms of the Weyl
representation for this equation. The semiclassical description of the Wigner
function in terms of chords, each with its classically defined amplitude and
phase, is thus inserted in the integrals, which leads to an explicit
differential equation for the Wigner function. All the Lindblad operators are
assumed to be represented by smooth phase space functions corresponding to
classical variables. In the case that these are real, representing hermitian
operators, the semiclassical Lindblad equation can be integrated. There results
a simple extension of the unitary evolution of the semiclassical Wigner
function, which does not affect the phase of each chord contribution, while
dampening its amplitude. This decreases exponentially, as governed by the time
integral of the square difference of the Lindblad functions along the classical
trajectories of both tips of each chord. The decay of the amplitudes is shown
to imply diffusion in energy for initial states that are nearly pure.
Projecting the Wigner function onto an orthogonal position or momentum basis,
the dampening of long chords emerges as the exponential decay of off-diagonal
elements of the density matrix.

  localization on wedge-horizons</title><description>  It is shown that a suitably formulated algebraic lightfront holography, in
which the lightfront is viewed as the linear extension of the upper causal
horizon of a wedge region, is capable of overcoming the shortcomings of the old
lightfront quantization. The absence of transverse vacuum fluctuations which
this formalism reveals, is responsible for an area (edge of the wedge)
-rearrangement of degrees of freedom which in turn leads to the notion of area
density of entropy for a ``split localization''. This area proportionality of
horizon associated entropy has to be compared to the volume dependence of
ordinary heat bath entropy. The desired limit, in which the split distance
vanishes and the localization on the horizon becomes sharp, can at most yield a
relative area density which measures the ratio of area densities for different
quantum matter. In order to obtain a normalized area density one needs the
unknown analog of a second fundamental law of thermodynamics for thermalization
caused by vacuum fluctuation through localization on causal horizons. This is
similar to the role of the classical Gibbs form of that law which relates
Bekenstein's classical area formula with the Hawking quantum mechanism for
thermalization from black holes. PACS: 11.10.-z, 11.30.-j, 11.55.-m

discrete-time system with input and output channels and a feedback, is
described. A dynamical theory of quantum discrete-time adaptive measurements
and multi-stage quantum statistical decisions is developed and applied to the
optimal feedback control problem for the quantum dynamical objects. Quantum
analogies of Stratonovich non-stationary filtering, and Bellman quantum
dynamical programming in the discrete time are derived.
  A Gaussian Langevin model of the quantum one-dimensional linear Markovian
dynamical system matched with a quantum linear transmission line as an
input-output quantum noisy channel is studied. The optimal quantum multi-stage
decision rule consisting of a classical linear optimal control strategy and the
quantum optimal filtering of the noise is found. The latter contains the
optimal quantum coherent measurement on the output of the line and the
recursive processing by the Kalman filter.
  A time-continuous limit of the above model is considered, and the quantum

a quantum transmission line.

classical-quantum correspondences such as quantum encodings can be treated as
diagonal semi-classical (d-) couplings, and the entanglements characterized by
truly quantum (q-) couplings, can be regarded as truly quantum encodings. The
relative entropy of the d-compound and entangled states leads to two different
types of entropy for a given quantum state: the von Neumann entropy, which is
achieved as the maximum of mutual information over all d-entanglements, and the
dimensional entropy, which is achieved at the standard entanglement -- true
quantum entanglement, coinciding with a d-entanglement only in the case of pure
marginal states. The d- and q- information of a quantum noisy channel are
respectively defined via the input d- and q- encodings, and the q-capacity of a
quantum noiseless channel is found as the logarithm of the dimensionality of
the input algebra. The quantum capacity may double the classical capacity,
achieved as the supremum over all d-couplings, or encodings, bounded by the
logarithm of the dimensionality of a maximal Abelian subalgebra.

be the basis of free will in the human beings. Basically, they argue that free
will is possible because there is an ontological indeterminism in the natural
laws, and that the mind is responsible for the wave function collapse of
matter, which leads to a choice among the different possibilities for the body.
However, I defend the opposite thesis, that free will cannot be defended in
terms of QM. First, because indeterminism does not imply free will, it is
merely a necessary condition but not enough to defend it. Second, because all
considerations about an autonomous mind sending orders to the body is against
our scientific knowledge about human beings; in particular, neither
neurological nor evolutionary theory can admit dualism. The quantum theory of
measurement can be interpreted without the intervention of human minds, but
other fields of science cannot contemplate the mentalist scenario, so it is
concluded that QM has nothing to say about the mind or free will, and its
scientific explanation is more related to biology than to physics. A fatalistic
or materialist view, which denies the possibility of a free will, makes much
more sense in scientific terms.

states on an operator algebra to include the classical and quantum encodings as
particular cases. The true quantum entanglements are characterized by quantum
couplings which are described as transpose-CP, but not Completely Positive
(CP), trace-normalized linear positive maps of the algebra.
  The entangled (total) information is defined in this paper as a relative
entropy of the conditional (the derivative of the compound state with respect
to the input) and the unconditional output states. Thus defined the total
information of the entangled states leads to two different types of the entropy
for a given quantum state: the von Neumann entropy, or c-entropy, which is
achieved as the supremum of the information over all c-entanglements and thus
is semi-classical, and the true quantum entropy, or q-entropy, which is
achieved at the standard entanglement.
  The q-capacity, defined as the supremum over all entanglements, coincides
with the topological entropy. In the case of the simple algebra it doubles the
c-capacity, coinciding with the rank-entropy. The conditional q-entropy based
on the q-entropy, is positive, unlike the von Neumann conditional entropy, and
the q-information of a quantum channel is proved to be additive.

containing a single defect, we are able to push the limits of Q/V beyond those
achievable by standard micropost designs, based on the simple rules established
for planar DBR microcavities. We show that some of the rules that work well for
designing large-diameter microposts (e.g., high-refractive index contrast) fail
to provide high-quality cavities with small diameters. By tuning the
thicknesses of mirror layers and the spacer, the number of mirror pairs, the
refractive indices of high and low refractive index regions, and the cavity
diameter, we are able to achieve Q as high as 10^4, together with a mode volume
of 1.6 cubic wavelengths of light in the high-refractive-index material. The
combination of high Q and small V makes these structures promising candidates
for the observation of such cavity quantum electrodynamics phenomena as strong
coupling between a quantum dot and the cavity field, and single-quantum-dot
lasing.

ground state of a slowly varying Hamiltonian. The ground state of the initial
Hamiltonian is easy to construct; the ground state of the final Hamiltonian
encodes the solution of the computational problem. These algorithms have
generally been studied in the case where the &quot;straight line&quot; path from initial
to final Hamiltonian is taken. But there is no reason not to try paths
involving terms that are not linear combinations of the initial and final
Hamiltonians. We give several proposals for randomly generating new paths.
Using one of these proposals, we convert an algorithmic failure into a success.

of the corresponding maximally entangled mixed states is determined primarily
analytically. As measures of entanglement, we consider entanglement of

into the quantum domain. This paper explores further extensions of these ideas
that may have a substantial potential for further research. Upon reformulating
quantum game theory as a theory of classical games played by &quot;quantum players&quot;
I take a constructive approach. The roles of the players and the arbiter are
investigated for clues on the nature of the quantum game space.
  Upon examination of the role of the arbiter, a possible non-commutative
nature of pay-off operators can be deduced. I investigate a sub-class of games
in which the pay-off operators satisfy non-trivial commutation relations.
Non-abelian pay-off operators can be used to generate whole families of quantum
games.

  distinguishability</title><description>  We investigate the classical nature of the spin coherent states. In addition
to being minimum uncertainty states, as the size of the spin, S, increases, the
classical nature is seen to increase in two respects: in their resistance to
entanglement generation (when passed through a beam splitter) and in the
distinguishability of the states. In the infinite S limit the spin coherent
state is a subclass of the optical coherent states (namely the subclass of
orthogonal optical coherent states). These states generate no entanglement and
are obviously completely distinguishable. The decline of the generated
entanglement, and in this sense increase in classicality with S, is very slow
and dependent on the amplitude z of the state. Surprisingly we find that for
|z| &gt; 1 there is an initial increase in entanglement followed by an extremely
gradual decline to zero. The distinguishability, on the other hand, quickly
becomes classical for all z. We illustrate the distinguishability of spin
coherent states in a novel manner using the representation of Majorana.

component of spin for spin-1/2 particles in a magnetic field with a spatial
gradient, to determine the conditions under which a previous classical
description is valid. A density matrix treatment is required for two reasons.
The first arises because the particles initially are not in a pure state due to
thermal motion. The second reason is that each particle interacts with the
magnetic field and the other particles, with the latter taken to be via a
2-body central force. The equations for the 1-body Wigner distribution
functions are written in a general manner, and the places where quantum
mechanical effects can play a role are identified. One that may not have been
considered previously concerns the momentum associated with the magnetic field
gradient, which is proportional to the time integral of the gradient. Its
relative magnitude compared with the important momenta in the problem is a
significant parameter, and if their ratio is not small some non-classical
effects contribute to the solution.
  Assuming the field gradient is sufficiently small, and a number of other
inequalities are satisfied involving the mean wavelength, range of the force,
and the mean separation between particles, we solve the integro- partial
differential equations for the Wigner functions to second order in the strength
of the gradient. When the same reasoning is applied to a different problem with
no field gradient, but having instead a gradient to the z-component of
polarization, the connection with the diffusion coefficient is established, and
we find agreement with the classical result for the rate of decrease of the
transverse component of magnetization.

  computation</title><description>  We apply a quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm to a combinatorial
optimization problem where the cost function depends entirely on the of the
number of unit bits in a n-bit string (Hamming weight). The solution of the
optimization problem is encoded as a ground state of the problem Hamiltonian
H_p for the z-projection of a total spin-n/2. We show that tunneling barriers
for the total spin can be completely suppressed during the algorithm if the
initial Hamiltonian has its ground state extended in the space of the
z-projections of the spin. This suppression takes place even if the cost
function has deep and well separated local minima. We provide an intuitive
picture for this effect and show that it guarantees the polynomial complexity
of the algorithm in a very broad class of cost functions. We suggest a simple
example of the Hamiltonian for the adiabatic evolution: H(tau) = (1-tau) hat
S_{x}^{2} + tau H_p, with parameter tau slowly varying in time between 0 and 1.
We use WKB analysis for the large spin to estimate the minimum energy gap
between the two lowest adiabatic eigenvalues of H(tau).

two-level atomic transition is studied for light intensities below saturation.
Analytical expression for the transient absorption spectra are given for simple

realistic atomic transitions, where the Zeeman degeneracy is fully accounted
for, is presented. EIT and EIA resonances have a similar (opposite sign) time

always be expressed as a product state involving entangled two-mode squeezed
states and single mode local states at each side. The character of entanglement
of the state can therefore be understood modewise; that is, a given mode on one

the total bi-partite entanglement is the sum of the modewise entanglement. This

However, the result can be extended to a special family of &quot;isotropic&quot; states,

diffusion. Random matrix theory provides explicit analytical predictions for
the mean square displacement of a particle in the system. These results exhibit
a crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion, with crossover time from
diffusive to ballistic motion on the order of the inverse of Planck's constant.
We can argue, that for a large class of 1D quantum random walks, similar to the
quantum multi-baker, a sufficient condition for diffusion in the semi-classical
limit is classically chaotic dynamics in each cell. Using an initial
equilibrium density matrix, we find that diffusive behavior is recovered in the

definition of scattering observables and is equal to an absorption (creation)
of particles in the origin. It is shown, that suggested regularization is an
analytical continuation of the scattering amplitudes of repulsive singular
potential in interaction constant $\alpha_{s}$. The nearthreshold properties of
regularized in a mentioned way singular potential are examined. We obtain
expressions for the scattering lengths, which turn to be complex even for
infinitesimal imaginary part of interaction constant. The problem of
perturbation of nearthreshold states of regular potential by a singular one is
treated, the expressions for level shifts and widths are obtained. We show,
that the physical sense of suggested regularization is that the scattering
observables are insensitive to any details of the short range modification of
singular potential, if there exists sufficiently strong inelastic short range
interaction. In this case the scattering observables are determined by
solutions of Schrodinger equation with regularized potential $-(\alpha_{s}\pm
i0)/r^{s}$. We point out that the developed formalism can be applied for the

eigenstates when the potential equals the sum of two localized, but not
necessarily weak potentials $V_{1}(\vec{r})$ and $V_{2}(\vec{r})$, with the
distance $L$ between the respective centers of the two taken to be quite large.
It is assumed that complete eigenfunctions of the local Hamiltonians (i.e., in
the presence of $V_{1}(\vec{r})$ or $V_{2}(\vec{r})$ only) are available as
inputs to our perturbation theory. If the two local Hamiltonians have
degenerate bound-state energy levels, a systematic extension of the molecular
orbital theory (or the tight-binding approximation) follows from our formalism.
Our approach can be viewed as a systematic adaptation of the multiple
scattering theory to the problem of bound states.

problems in present science, and no method has been found to strictly
differentiate the conscious being from the being without consciousness or usual
matter. In this short paper, we present a strict physical method based on
revised quantum dynamics to test the existence of consciousness, and the
principle is to use the distinguishability of nonorthogonal single states. We
demonstrate that although the dynamical collapse time can't be measured by a
physical measuring device, a conscious being can perceive it under the assumed
QSC condition, thus can distinguish the nonorthogonal single states in the
framework of revised quantum dynamics This in principle provides a quantum
method to differentiate man and machine, or to test the existence of
consciousness. We further discuss the rationality of the assumed QSC condition,
and denote that some experimental evidences have indicated that our human being
can satisfy the condition. This not only provides some confirmation of our
method, but also indicates that the method is a practical proposal, which can
be implemented in the near future experiments.

with parameter A a primitive 4r-th root of unity (r=k+2). In each of these
representations (as well as the general G case), Dehn twists act as
transformations of finite order, so none represents the mapping class group
M(Y) faithfully. However, taken together, the quantum SU(2) representations are
faithful on non-central elements of M(Y). (Note that M(Y) has non-trivial
center only if Y is a sphere with 0, 1, or 2 punctures, a torus with 0, 1, or 2
punctures, or the closed surface of genus = 2.) Specifically, for a non-central
h in M(Y) there is an r_0(h) such that if r&gt;= r_0(h) and A is a primitive 4r-th
root of unity then h acts projectively nontrivially on V_A(Y). Jones' [J]
original representation rho_n of the braid groups B_n, sometimes called the
generic q-analog-SU(2)-representation, is not known to be faithful. However, we
show that any braid h not= id in B_n admits a cabling c = c_1,...,c_n so that
rho_N (c(h)) not= id, N=c_1 + ... + c_n.

wires through quantum ground-state computation and implements gates through
identities following from angular momentum algebra and statistics. The gates
are static in the sense that they contribute Hamiltonian 0 and hold as
constants of the motion; only the wires are dynamic. Just as a spin 1/2 makes
an ideal 1-bit memory element, a spin 1 makes an ideal 3-bit gate. Such gates
cost no computation time: relaxing the wires alone solves the network. We
compare computation time with that of an easier Boolean network where all the
gate constraints are simply removed. This computation model is robust with
respect to decoherence and yields a generalized quantum speed-up for all NP
problems.

systems satisfies a dynamical generalization of the detailed balance condition
({\it dynamical detailed balance}) expressing the fact that all the
micro-currents, associated to the Bohr frequencies are constant. The usual
(equilibrium) detailed balance condition is characterized by the property that
this constant is identically zero. From this we deduce a simple and
experimentally measurable relation expressing the microcurrent associated to a

of the occupation probabilities of the two levels, with coefficients given by
the generalized susceptivities (transport coefficients). Finally, using a

we show that this condition is equivalent to a &quot;local&quot; generalization of the

single photons with high probability, while simultaneously suppressing the
probability of yielding two or more photons. Because of this, single photon
sources cannot really produce single photons on demand. We describe a
multiplexed system that allows the probabilities of producing one and more
photons to be adjusted independently, enabling a much better approximation of a
source of single photons on demand. The scheme uses a heralded photon source
based on parametric downconversion, but by effectively breaking the trigger
detector area into multiple regions, we are able to extract more information
about a heralded photon than is possible with a conventional arrangement. This
scheme allows photons to be produced along with a quantitative
``certification'' that they are single photons. Some of the single-photon
certifications can be significantly better than what is possible with
conventional downconversion sources (using a unified trigger detector region),
as well as being better than faint laser sources. With such a source of more
tightly certified single photons, it should be possible to improve the maximum
secure bit rate possible over a quantum cryptographic link. We present an
analysis of the relative merits of this method over the conventional
arrangement.

in Birkhoff and von Neumann's proposal for a quantum logic. The (consistent or
decoherent) histories solution is provided by its single framework rule, an
approach that includes conventional (Copenhagen) quantum theory as a special

probabilities which make no reference to a sample space or event algebra
(``correlations without correlata''). But this leads to severe conceptual
difficulties, which almost inevitably couple quantum theory to unresolved
problems of human consciousness. Using histories allows a sharper quantum
description than is possible with a density matrix, suggesting that the latter
provides an ensemble rather than an irreducible single-system description as

which may serve as qubits of a quantum computer. Each electron is localized in
a 3D potential well formed by the image potential in helium and the potential
from a submicron electrode submerged into helium. We estimate parameters of the
confining potential and characterize the electron energy spectrum. Decay of the
excited electron state is due to two-ripplon scattering and to scattering by
phonons in helium. We identify mechanisms of coupling to phonons and estimate
contributions from different scattering mechanisms. Even in the absence of a
magnetic field we expect the decay rate to be $\alt 10^4$ s$^{-1}$. We also
calculate the dephasing rate, which is due primarily to ripplon scattering off
an electron. This rate is $\alt 10^2$ s$^{-1}$ for typical operation
temperatures.

correlations between entangled subsystems is in conflict with relativistic
space-time symmetry. Proposals to abandon relativistic symmetry, in the sense
of explicitly returning to an absolute time and preferred frame, are rejected
on the grounds that the preferred frame is not empirically detectable, so the
asymmetry is an unsatisfactory feature in physical theory. A &quot;symmetric view&quot;
is proposed in which measurement events on space-like separated entangled
subsystems are connected by a symmetric two-way mutual influence. Because of
this reciprocity, there is complete symmetry of the description: Einsteinian
relativity of simultaneity and space-time symmetry are completely preserved.
The nature of the two-way influence is considered, as well as the possibility
of an empirical test.

have led to a host of unexplained results: dramatic losses of condensate atoms
for an across-resonance sweep of the magnetic field, a collapsing condensate
with a burst of atoms emanating from the remnant condensate, increased losses
for decreasing interaction times--until very short times are reached, and
coherent oscillations between remnant and burst atoms. In particular, the
amplitude of the remnant-burst oscillations, and the corresponding missing
atoms, have prompted speculation as to the formation of a molecular condensate.
Using a minimal mean-field model, we find that rogue dissociation, molecular
dissociation to noncondensate atom pairs, is qualitatively implicated as the
physical mechanism responsible for these observations, although very little
molecular condensate is formed. Refining the model provides excellent
quantitative agreement with the experimental remnant-burst oscillations, and
the fraction of molecular condensate accounts almost entirely for the measured
atom loss.

By
applying a Cartan decomposition to su(4), we find that the geometric structure
of non-local gates is a 3-Torus. We derive the invariants for local
transformations, and connect these local invariants to the coordinates of the
3-Torus. Since different points on the 3-Torus may correspond to the same local
equivalence class, we use the Weyl group theory to reduce the symmetry. We show
that the local equivalence classes of two-qubit gates are in one-to-one
correspondence with the points in a tetrahedron except on the base. We then
study the properties of perfect entanglers, that is, the two-qubit operations
that can generate maximally entangled states from some initially separable
states. We provide criteria to determine whether a given two-qubit gate is a
perfect entangler and establish a geometric description of perfect entanglers
by making use of the tetrahedral representation of non-local gates. We find
that exactly half the non-local gates are perfect entanglers. We also
investigate the non-local operations generated by a given Hamiltonian. We first
study the gates that can be directly generated by a Hamiltonian. Then we
explicitly construct a quantum circuit that contains at most three non-local
gates generated by a two-body interaction Hamiltonian, together with at most
four local gates generated by single qubit terms. We prove that such a quantum
circuit can simulate any arbitrary two-qubit gate exactly, and hence it
provides an efficient implementation of universal quantum computation and

understanding of quantum mechanics. The emphasis is put on the very special
correlations that this theory makes possible: they are forbidden by very
general arguments based on realism and local causality. In fact, these
correlations are completely impossible in any circumstance, except the very
special situations designed by physicists especially to observe these purely
quantum effects. Another general point that is emphasized is the necessity for
the theory to predict the emergence of a single result in a single realization
of an experiment. For this purpose, orthodox quantum mechanics introduces a
special postulate: the reduction of the state vector, which comes in addition
to the Schrodinger evolution postulate. Nevertheless, the presence in parallel
of two evolution processes of the same object (the state vector) maybe a
potential source for conflicts; various attitudes that are possible to avoid
this problem are discussed in this text. After a brief historical introduction,
recalling how the very special status of the state vector has emerged in
quantum mechanics, various conceptual difficulties are introduced and
discussed. The Einstein Podolsky Rosen (EPR) theorem is presented with the help
of a botanical parable, in a way that emphasizes how deeply the EPR reasoning
is rooted into what is often called &quot;scientific method''. In another section
the GHZ argument, the Hardy impossibilities, as well as the BKS theorem are
introduced in simple terms.

tend to 0. If $H(rho_p)$ is estimated, we can compress the coding rate to the
admissible rate $H(rho_p)$ with a probability close to 1. However, when we
perform a naive measurement for the estimation of $H(rho_p)$, the input state
is demolished. By smearing the measurement, we successfully treat the trade-off
between the estimation of $H(rho_p)$ and the non-demolition of the input state.
Our protocol can be used not only for the Schumacher's scheme but also for the

for the quantum key distribution(QKD) must solve the very complex problem of
decoding the classical CSS code. In the decoding stage, Bob has to compare his
string with an exponentially large number of all the strings in certain code
space to find out the closest one. Here we have spotted that, in an
entanglement purification protocol(EPP), the random basis in the state
preparation stage is only necessary to those check qubits, but uncessary to the
code qubits. In our modified two way communication EPP(2-EPP) protocol, Alice
and Bob may first take all the parity checks on $Z$ basis to reduce the bit
flip error to strictly zero with a high probability, e.g., $1-2^{-30}$, and
then use the CSS code to obtain the final key. We show that, this type of 2-EPP
protocol can be reduced to an equivalent prepare and measure protocol. In our

in the effective field theory (EFT) of nuclear forces is investigated by using
the formalism of the generalized quantum dynamics (GQD) developed in [J. Phys.
A, 5657 (1999)]. This formalism is based on a generalized dynamical equation
derived as the most general equation of motion consistent with the current
concepts of quantum physics. By using the example of the EFT of nuclear forces,
we demonstrate that a theory, which, being formulated in terms of Hamiltonian
formalism, leads to ultraviolet divergences, may manifest itself as a perfectly
consistent theory free from infinities, if it is considered from the more
general point of view provided by the GQD. We show that non-Hamiltonian
character of nucleon dynamics gives rise to some new problems connected with
discontinuity of the evolution operator. This discontinuity results in the fact
that the Hilbert space of nucleon states cannot be realized in the standard
way. A space which allows one to realize, in a natural way, the Hilbert space
of nucleon states is investigated. The structure of this space reflects the
existence of the high energy degrees of freedom which affect on low energy
nucleon dynamics.

example: central system + environment) with respect to weak interaction between
the two parts. Unified theoretical formalism is applied to study different
physical situations: (i) coherence of a forward evolution as measured by purity
of the reduced density matrix, (ii) stability of time evolution with respect to
small coupling between subsystems, and (iii) Loschmidt echo measuring dynamical
irreversibility. Stability has been measured either by fidelity of pure states
of a composite system, or by the so-called reduced fidelity of reduced density
matrices within a subsystem. Rigorous inequality among fidelity,
reduced-fidelity and purity is proved and a linear response theory is developed
expressing these three quantities in terms of time correlation functions of the
generator of interaction. The qualitatively different cases of regular
(integrable) or mixing (chaotic in the classical limit) dynamics in each of the
subsystems are discussed in detail. Theoretical results are demonstrated and
confirmed in a numerical example of two coupled kicked tops.

expectation value quantum computation, such as nuclear magnetic resonance
realizations, the computer consists of an ensemble of identical qubit-systems
amenable only to expectation value measurements. The prevalent strategy in such

  classification of protocols</title><description>  Mayers, Lo and Chau argued that all quantum bit commitment protocols are
insecure, because there is no way to prevent an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
cheating attack. However, Yuen presented some protocols which challenged the
previous impossibility argument. Up to now, it is still debated whether there
exist or not unconditionally secure protocols. In this paper the above
controversy is addressed. For such purpose, a complete classification of all
possible bit commitment protocols is given, including all possible cheating
attacks. Focusing on the simplest class of protocols (non-aborting and with
complete and perfect verification), it is shown how naturally a
game-theoretical situation arises. For these protocols, bounds for the cheating
probabilities are derived, involving the two quantum operations encoding the
bit values and their respective alternate Kraus decompositions. Such bounds are
different from those given in the impossibility proof. The whole classification
and analysis has been carried out using a &quot;finite open system&quot; approach. The
discrepancy with the impossibility proof is explained on the basis of the
implicit adoption of a &quot;closed system approach&quot;--equivalent to modeling the
commitment as performed by two fixed machines interacting unitarily in a
overall &quot;closed system&quot;--according to which it is possible to assume as &quot;openly
known&quot; both the initial state and the probability distributions for all secret
parameters, which can be then &quot;purified&quot;. This approach is also motivated by
existence of unitary extensions for any open system. However, it is shown that
the closed system approach for the classification of commitment protocols
unavoidably leads to infinite dimensions, which then invalidate the continuity
argument at the basis of the impossibility proof.

We show the advantages of a coupling scheme involving maximum coherence and
demonstrate how a large atomic coherence between a ground and an highly excited
state can be prepared by SCRAP. Full analytic solutions of the field
propagation problem taking into account pump field depletion are derived. The
solutions are obtained with the help of an Hamiltonian approach which in the
adiabatic limit permits to reduce the full set of Maxwell-Bloch equations to
simple canonical equations of Hamiltonian mechanics for the field variables. It
is found that the conversion efficiency reached is largely enhanced if the
phase mismatch induced by linear refraction is compensated. A detailed analysis
of the phase matching conditions shows, however, that the phase mismatch
contribution from the Kerr effect cannot be compensated simultaneously with
linear refraction contribution. Therefore, the conversion efficiency in a
coupling scheme involving maximum coherence prepared by SCRAP is high, but not
equal to unity.

However, the Hilbert space formalism tends to obscure the relationship between

uncertainty relations for the measurement process that are valid for arbitrary

phase difference between the two corrugations. Both systematic and random
errors are analysed and a lateral force amplitude of $3.2\times 10^{-13} $N was
measured at a separation distance of 221 nm with a resulting relative error 24%

amplitude on separation was investigated and shown to be consistent with the
inverse fourth power distance dependence. The complete theory of the lateral

P. Feynman, Foundations of Physics, Vol. 16, No. 6, p597-531, 1986). Feynman's
answer was negative. In this paper, we will revisit the same question for the

discrete time Fourier transform uncertainty principle plays a fundamental role
in showing that Shor's type of quantum algorithms has efficient running time
and conclude that the discrete time uncertainty principle is an aid in our
current formulation and understanding of Shor's type of quantum algorithms. It
turns out that for these algorithms, the probability of measuring an element in
some set $T$ (at the end of the algorithm) can be written in terms of the
time-limiting and band-limiting operators from finite Fourier analysis.
Associated with these operators is the finite Fourier transform uncertainty
principle. The uncertainty principle provides a lower bound for the above
probability. We will derive lower bounds for these types of probabilities in
general. We will call these lower bounds quantum algorithm uncertainty
principles or QAUP. QAUP are important because they give us some sense of the
probability of measuring something desirable. We will use these lower bounds to

the semiclassical group velocity. We show that the time of arrival of the

of this transient pulse exhibits an invariant behavior under a rescaling

are studied from an open system's point of view. Employing functional
techniques of field theory, the degrees of freedom of the radiation field are
eliminated to obtain the influence phase functional which describes the reduced
dynamics of the matter variables. The general theory is applied to the dynamics
of a single electron in the radiation field. From a study of the wave packet
dynamics a quantitative measure for the degree of decoherence, the decoherence
function, is deduced. The latter is shown to describe the emergence of
decoherence through the emission of bremsstrahlung caused by the relative
motion of interfering wave packets. It is argued that this mechanism is the
most fundamental process in Quantum Electrodynamics leading to the destruction
of coherence, since it dominates for short times and because it is at work even
in the electromagnetic field vacuum at zero temperature. It turns out that
decoherence trough bremsstrahlung is very small for single electrons but
extremely large for superpositions of many-particle states.

particular, geometric quantum computation may be achieved by eliminating the

  black hole entropy</title><description>  The algebraic approach to black hole quantization requires the horizon area
eigenvalues to be equally spaced. As shown previously, for a neutral
non-rotating black hole, such eigenvalues must be $2^{n}$-fold degenerate if
one constructs the black hole stationary states by means of a pair of creation
operators subject to a specific algebra. We show that the algebra of these two
building blocks exhibits $U(2)\equiv U(1)\times SU(2)$ symmetry, where the area
operator generates the U(1) symmetry. The three generators of the SU(2)
symmetry represent a {\it global} quantum number (hyperspin) of the black hole,
and we show that this hyperspin must be zero. As a result, the degeneracy of
the $n$-th area eigenvalue is reduced to $2^{n}/n^{3/2}$ for large $n$, and
therefore, the logarithmic correction term $-3/2\log A$ should be added to the
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We also provide a heuristic approach explaining
this result, and an evidence for the existence of {\it two} building blocks.

They
are: the notion &quot;wave-particle&quot;, the probabilistic interpretation of the
Schroedinger wave \psi-function and hence the probability amplitude and its
phase, long-range action, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, etc. The
probabilistic formalism is developed in the phase space, but not in the real
one. Elimination of the difficulties is likely if we are able to develop
quantum mechanics in the real space. Such a theory in fact can be constructed,
however, it should proceed from deepest first principles starting from the
notion of a 4D space-time, the notion of a massive particle in the space, the

Furthermore, their are subtle differences in causality as well as the

procedure which permits perfect cloning of an arbitrary, unknown &quot;qubit&quot; (the
spin or polarization state of a single quantum system)1,2. However, it is
believed that a perfect copying protocol can be achieved, at least in
principle, if the qubit to be copied is destroyed in the original system.
Quantum teleportation3,4 is supposed to allow for such a result. Here, this
belief is shown to be invalidated by a fundamental uncertainty about the number
of particles involved in any process, as predicted by Quantum Field Theory. As
a result, teleportation cannot provide an infallible copying procedure for the
single qubits, not even in the limit of perfect experimental sensitivities. The
no-cloning theorem1,2 can then be generalized to the case of destroying the
original. Teleportation remains an interesting statistical procedure, having an
unavoidable theoretical error at the percent level or few orders of magnitude
smaller, depending on the physical process that is used. Although it cannot be
made arbitrarily small, such an error is small enough to remain hidden in
present experiments.

classical messages encoded using quantum states, a task I call &quot;uncloneable
encryption.&quot; An uncloneable encryption scheme has the property that an
eavesdropper Eve not only cannot read the encrypted message, but she cannot
copy it down for later decoding. She could steal it, but then the receiver Bob
would not receive the message, and would thus be alerted that something was
amiss. I prove that any authentication scheme for quantum states acts as a
secure uncloneable encryption scheme. Uncloneable encryption is also closely
related to quantum key distribution (QKD), demonstrating a close connection
between cryptographic tasks for quantum states and for classical messages.
Thus, studying uncloneable encryption and quantum authentication allows for
some modest improvements in QKD protocols. While the main results apply to a
one-time key with unconditional security, I also show uncloneable encryption
remains secure with a pseudorandom key. In this case, to defeat the scheme, Eve
must break the computational assumption behind the pseudorandom sequence before
Bob receives the message, or her opportunity is lost. This means uncloneable
encryption can be used in a non-interactive setting, where QKD is not
available, allowing Alice and Bob to convert a temporary computational
assumption into a permanently secure message.

a magnetic dipole pointing in a certain fixed direction: along a purely time
dependent magnetic field in the SAB case and perpendicular to a planar static
electric field in the AC case. We extend these effects to arbitrary direction
of the magnetic dipole. The precise conditions for having nondispersive
precession and interference effects in these generalized set ups are delineated
both classically and quantally. Under these conditions the dipole is affected
by a nonvanishing torque that causes pure precession around the directions
defined by the ideal set ups. It is shown that the precession angles are in the
quantal case linearly related to the ideal phase differences, and that the
nonideal phase differences are nonlinearly related to the ideal phase
differences. It is argued that the latter nonlinearity is due the appearance of
a geometric phase associated with the nontrivial spin path. It is further
demonstrated that the spatial force vanishes in all cases except in the
classical treatment of the nonideal AC set up, where the occurring force has to
be compensated by the experimental arrangement. Finally, for a closed
space-time loop the local precession effects can be inferred from the
interference pattern characterized by the nonideal phase differences and the
visibilities. It is argued that this makes it natural to regard SAB and AC as
essentially local and nontopological effects.

consequences for how we can understand the concept of the quantum mechanical
state and the nature of the `system' which is `in' this state. Here it is
argued that the old notion of the `object' which is in a classical mechanical
state is drawn from a substance/property ontology derived from Aristotle's
analysis of categorical propositions. In moving to describing a system in a
quantum mechanical state, the system that is `in' such a state can no longer be
so regarded as a substance possessing properties. Bohr argues that the concept
refers to an interaction which has a feature of wholeness or `individuality'
that implies that the distinction between `object system' and `observing
system' is relative to the context of the description. This conclusion, in
turn, implies the need for a combination of complementary modes of description;
however, because of his reticence in making ontological claims, he failed to
develop this dimension of his new framework of complementarity.

They each have
unique noise processes that make none of them fully reliable at this time.
There are several error correction/avoidance techniques which are valuable for
reducing or eliminating errors, but not one, alone, will serve as a panacea.
One must therefore take advantage of the strength of each of these techniques
so that we may extend the coherence times of the quantum systems and create
more reliable computing devices. To this end we give a general strategy for
using dynamical decoupling operations on encoded subspaces. These encodings may
be of any form; of particular importance are decoherence-free subspaces and
quantum error correction codes. We then give means for empirically determining
an appropriate set of dynamical decoupling operations for a given experiment.
Using these techniques, we then propose a comprehensive encoding solution to
many of the problems of quantum computing proposals which use exchange-type
interactions. This uses a decoherence-free subspace and an efficient set of
dynamical decoupling operations. It also addresses the problems of
controllability in solid state quantum dot devices.

the free particle on a line R or on the interval [-l, l] where the point
singularity lies at x = 0. In one dimension, the singularity is known to admit
a U(2) family of different connection conditions which include as a special
case the familiar one that arises under the Dirac delta-potential. Similarly,
each of the walls at x = l and x = -l admits a U(1) family of boundary
conditions including the Dirichlet and the Neumann boundary conditions. Under
these general connection/boundary conditions, the system is shown to possess an
N = 1 or N = 2 SUSY for various choices of the singularity and the walls, and
the SUSY is found to be `good' or `broken' depending on the choices made. We
use the supercharge which allows for a constant shift in the energy, and argue
that if the system is supersymmetric then the supercharge is self-adjoint on
states that respect the connection/boundary conditions specified by the
singularity.

scaffold protein dynamics and detachment of the calcium sensor v-SNARE
synaptotagmin-1. The beta-neurexin molecules are tuned via fast propagating
solitons by the quantum coherent microtubule network so that the beta-neurexin
molecule thermal vibrations could promote or suppress conformational changes

detachment from the SNARE complex under calcium ion binding. Following the

as well as regions with negative values. It is found that the explicit solution
gives a correct description of the time evolution of the Wigner function. We
examine next the pseudoparticle approximation which uses classical trajectories
to evolve the Wigner function. We find that the pseudoparticle approximation
reproduces the general features of the time evolution, but there are
deviations. We show how these deviations can be systematically reduced by
including higher-order correction terms in powers of $\hbar^2$.

  systems</title><description>  Analyzing the properties of entanglement in many-particle spin-1/2 systems is
generally difficult because the system's Hilbert space grows exponentially with
the number of constituent particles, $N$. Fortunately, it is still possible to
investigate many-particle entanglement when the state of the system possesses
sufficient symmetry. In this paper, we present a practical method for
efficiently computing various bipartite entanglement measures for states in the
symmetric subspace and perform these calculations for $N\sim 10^3$. By
considering all possible bipartite splits, we construct a picture of the
multiscale entanglement in large symmetric systems. In particular, we
characterize dynamically generated spin-squeezed states by comparing them to
known reference states (e.g., GHZ and Dicke states) and new families of states
with near-maximal bipartite entropy. We quantify the trade-off between the
degree of entanglement and its robustness to particle loss, emphasizing that
substantial entanglement need not be fragile.

and momentum operators generate the Lie superalgebra sl(1|3), are further
investigated. Within each state space W(p), p=1,2,..., the energy E_q,
q=0,1,2,3, takes no more than 4 different values. If the oscillator is in a
stationary state \psi_q \in W(p) then measurements of the non-commuting
Cartesian coordinates of the particle are such that their allowed values are
consistent with it being found at a finite number of sites, called ``nests''.
These lie on a sphere centered on the origin of fixed, finite radius \varrho_q.
The nests themselves are at the vertices of a rectangular parallelepiped. In
the typical cases (p&gt;2) the number of nests is 8 for q=0 and 3, and varies from
8 to 24, depending on the state, for q=1 and 2. The number of nests is less in
the atypical cases (p=1,2), but it is never less than two. In certain states in
W(2) (resp. in W(1)) the oscillator is ``polarized'' so that all the nests lie
on a plane (resp. on a line). The particle cannot be localized in any one of
the available nests alone since the coordinates do not commute. The
probabilities of measuring particular values of the coordinates are discussed.
The mean trajectories and the standard deviations of the coordinates and
momenta are computed, and conclusions are drawn about uncertainty relations.
The rotational invariance of the system is also discussed.

electrodynamics (QED), considering a cold two-level atom in a single-mode
high-finesse standing-wave cavity as a nonlinear Hamiltonian system with three
coupled degrees of freedom: translational, internal atomic, and the field. The
system proves to have different types of motion including L\'{e}vy flights and
chaotic walkings of an atom in a cavity. It is shown that the translational
motion, related to the atom recoils, is governed by an equation of a parametric
nonlinear pendulum with a frequency modulated by the Rabi oscillations. This
type of dynamics is chaotic with some width of the stochastic layer that is
estimated analytically. The width is fairly small for realistic values of the
control parameters, the normalized detuning $\delta$ and atomic recoil
frequency $\alpha$. It is demonstrated how the atom-photon dynamics with a
given value of $\alpha$ depends on the values of $\delta$ and initial
conditions. Two types of L\'{e}vy flights, one corresponding to the ballistic
motion of the atom and another one corresponding to small oscillations in a
potential well, are found. These flights influence statistical properties of
the atom-photon interaction such as distribution of Poincar\'{e} recurrences
and moments of the atom position $x$. The simulation shows different regimes of
motion, from slightly abnormal diffusion with $&lt;x^2&gt;\sim\tau^{1.13}$ at $\delta
=1.2$ to a superdiffusion with $&lt;x^2&gt; \sim \tau^{2.2}$ at $\delta=1.92$ that
corresponds to a superballistic motion of the atom with an acceleration. The
obtained results can be used to find new ways to manipulate atoms, to cool and
trap them by adjusting the detuning $\delta$.

system, entanglement at the quantum level and chaos at the classical level
arise from the coupling between the atomic spin and its center-of- mass motion.
Experiments, performed deep in the quantum regime, correspond to dynamic
quantum tunneling. This nonclassical behavior is contrasted with the
predictions for an initial phase space distribution produced in the experiment,
but undergoing classical Hamiltonian flow. We study conditions under which the
trapped atoms can be made to exhibit classical dynamics through the process of
continuous measurement, which localizes the probability distribution to phase
space trajectories, consistent with the uncertainty principle and quantum
back-action noise. This method allows us to analytically and numerically

mean a quantum hidden subgroup algorithm that finds the period P of a function
F:R--&gt;R from the reals R to the reals R, where F belongs to a very general

  One objective in creating this continuous variable quantum algorithm was to
make the structure of Shor's factoring algorithm more mathematically
transparent, and thereby give some insight into the inner workings of Shor's
original algorithm. This continuous quantum algorithm also gives some insight
into the inner workings of Hallgren's Pell's equation algorithm. Two key
questions remain unanswered. Is this quantum algorithm more efficient than its
classical continuous variable counterpart? Is this quantum algorithm or some

for quantum states and quantum processes will be useful for developing photonic

directly switch 'on' and 'off' a physical coupling between the component
qubits. This is typically the key difficulty in implementation, and precludes
quantum computation in generic solid state systems, where interactions between
the constituents are 'always on'. Here we show that quantum computation is
possible in strongly coupled (Heisenberg) systems even when the interaction
cannot be controlled. The modest ability of 'tuning' the transition energies of
individual qubits proves to be sufficient, with a suitable encoding of the
logical qubits, to generate universal quantum gates. Furthermore, by tuning the
qubits collectively we provide a scheme with exceptional experimental
simplicity: computations are controlled via a single 'switch' of only six
settings. Our schemes are applicable to a wide range of physical
implementations, from excitons and spins in quantum dots through to bulk

where the entropy rises monotonically and the self-interference regimen where
the entropy oscillates and re-coherence phenomenon can be observed. We also
found that the break time from the first regimen to the second one becomes

of the memory quantum state within this subset and measuring the resulting

patterns which are closest in Hamming distance to the input, resulting in a
high probability of measuring a memory pattern very similar to it. The accuracy

fail, but not to make a mistake. The optimal procedure is the one with the
lowest failure probability. This procedure has been extended to bipartite
states where the two parties, Alice and Bob, are allowed to manipulate their
particles locally and communicate classically in order to determine which of
two possible two-particle states they have been given. The failure probability
of this local procedure has been shown to be the same as if the particles were

classical communication between the parties, either allowing none or
eliminating the possibility that one party's measurement depends on the result

decoherence in the quantum ``coin'' which drives the walk. We find exact
analytical expressions for the time dependence of the first two moments of
position, and show that in the long-time limit the variance grows linearly with
time, unlike the unitary walk. We compare this to the results of direct
numerical simulation, and see how the form of the position distribution changes
from the unitary to the usual classical result as we increase the strength of
the decoherence.

  dissociation of a Luttinger liquid</title><description>  We analyze ground-state properties of strictly one-dimensional molecular
matter comprised of identical particles of mass m. Such a class of systems can
be described by an additive two-body potential whose functional form is common
to all substances which only differ in the energy \epsilon and range l scales
of the potential. With this choice De Boer's quantum theorem of corresponding
states holds thus implying that ground-state properties expressed in
appropriate reduced form are only determined by the dimensionless parameter
\lambda_{0}^{2} \sim \hbar^{2}/ml^{2}\epsilon measuring the strength of
zero-point motion in the system. The presence of a minimum in the two-body
interaction potential leads to a many-body bound state which is a Luttinger
liquid. As \lambda_{0} increases, the asymmetry of the two-body potential
causes quantum expansion, softening, and eventual evaporation of the Luttinger
liquid into a gas phase. Selecting the pair interaction potential in the Morse
form we analytically compute the properties of the Luttinger liquid and its
range of existence. As lambda_{0} increases, the system first undergoes a
discontinuous evaporation transition into a diatomic gas followed by a
continuous dissociation transition into a monoatomic gas. In particular we find
that spin-polarized isotopes of hydrogen and He-3 are monoatomic gases, He-4 is
a diatomic gas, while molecular hydrogen and heavier substances are Luttinger
liquids. We also investigate the effect of finite pressure on the properties of
the liquid and monoatomic gas phases. In particular we estimate a pressure at
which molecular hydrogen undergoes an inverse Peierls transition into a
metallic state which is a one-dimensional analog of the transition predicted by
Wigner and Huntington in 1935.

transformation within spatial relativity theory is presented as a result of my
new physical model of existent fluctuating vacuum (FlcVcm). It is assumed that
the FlcVcm is considered as a molecular dielectric, which consists from neutral
dynamides, streamlined in a close-packed crystalline lattice. Every dynamide is
a neutral pair, consistent by two massless opposite point-like elementary
electric charges (ElmElcChrgs): electrino (-) and positrino (+). In a frozen
equilibrium position two contrary pont-like ElmElcChrgs within every one
dynamide are very closely installed one to another and therefore the aggregate
polarization of every dynamide and its electric field also have zero values.
The aggregate electric field of every dynamide polarizes nearest neighbors
dynamides in an account of which nearest dynamides interact between them-self,
because of which their elementary excitations, phonons and photons, have a wave
character and behaviors. We suppose that the photon is an polarization result
of the phonon within the fluctuating vacuum considered as an ideal dielectric
and therefore the photon could be considered as an elementary collective
excitation of the FlcVcm in the form of a solitary needle cylindrical harmonic
oscillation. Hence the light, which is a packet of the photons, must move
within FlcVcm with constant velocity and Dopler effect must be observed in both
cases, for the light and sound. Then all mathematical results of Lorentz
transformation could be considered as results of a demand of an independence of
the observation results from the reactive velocity of the observation frame.

Lagrangian is written as a difference between a function $T$, which represents
the quantum generalization of the kinetic energy and which depends on the
coordinate $x$ and the temporal derivatives of $x$ up the third order, and the
classical potential $V(x)$. The Hamiltonian is then constructed and the
corresponding canonical equations are deduced. The function $T$ is first
assumed arbitrary. The development of $T$ in a power series together with the
dimensional analysis allow us to fix univocally the series coefficients by
requiring that the well-known quantum stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation be
reproduced. As a consequence of this approach, we formulate the law of the
quantum motion representing a new version of the quantum Newton's law. We also
analytically establish the famous Bohm's relation % $\mu \dot{x} = \partial S_0

CM the dynamics is determined by the Lie algebra of Poisson brackets on the
manifold of scalar fields for classical position/momentum observables q/p, d/dt
q={q,H}, d/dt p={p,H}, QM evolves (in Heisenberg's picture) according to the
formally similar Lie algebra of commutator brackets of the corresponding
operators Q/P: d/dt Q=i/h [Q,H], d/dt P=i/h [P,H] where QP-PQ=ih. A further
common framework for comparing CM and QM is the category of symplectic
manifolds. Other than previous authors, this paper considers phase space of
Heisenberg's picture, i.e., the manifold of pairs of operator observables (Q,P)
satisfying commutation relation. On a sufficiently high algebraic level of
abstraction -- which we believe to be of interest on its own -- it turns out
that this approach leads to a truly NON-linear yet Hamiltonian reformulation of
QM evolution.

focusing on rapid adiabatic passage from atoms to molecules induced by a sweep
of the magnetic field across a wide (&gt;~ 10 G) Feshbach resonance in 85Rb. This
problem raises an interest because strong magnetoassociation is expected to
favor the creation of molecular-dissociated atom pairs over the formation of
molecular BEC [Javanainen and Mackie, Phys. Rev. Lett. 88, 090403 (2002)].
Nevertheless, the conversion to atom pairs is found to depend on the direction
of the sweep, so that a system initially above threshold (open dissociation
channel) may in fact give near-complete conversion to molecules.

  Excitation</title><description>  A physical model of the fluctuating vacuum (FlcVcm) and the photon as an
elementary collective excitation in a solitary needle cylindrical form are
offered. We assume that the FlcVcm is consistent by neutral dynamides, which
are streamlined in a close-packed crystalline lattice. Every dynamide is a
neutral pair, consistent by massless opposite point-like elementary electric
charges (ElmElcChrgs): electrino (-) and positrino (+). In an equilibrium
position two contrary Pnt-Lk ElmElcChrgs within every one dynamide are very
closely installed one to another and therefore its aggregate polarization and
its ElcFld also have zero values. However the absence of a mass in a rest of an
electrino and positrino makes possible they to display an infinitesimal
inertness of their own QntElcMgnFlds and a big mobility, what permits them to
be found a bigger time in an unequilibrium distorted position. The aggregate
ElcFld of dynamide reminds us that it could be considered as the QntElcFld of
an electric quasi-dipole because both massless electrino and positrino have the
same inertness. The aggregate ElcFld of every dynamide polarizes nearest
neighbour dynamides in an account of which they interact between them-self, on
account of which their photons display a wave character and behaviour. In order
to obtain a clear physical evidence and true physical explanation of an
emission and absorption of RlPhtns, I use Fermi method for the determination of
the time dependence of expansion coefficients of wave function of SchEl in a
hybrid state, using the solution of the Schrodinger quadratic differential wave
equation in partial derivatives with the potentials of Coulomb and of Lorentz
friction force.

  between real metals</title><description>  The energy of fluctuating electromagnetic field is investigated for the
thermal Casimir force acting between parallel plates made of real metal. It is
proved that for nondissipative media with temperature independent dielectric
permittivity the energy at nonzero temperature comprises of the (renormalized)
energies of the zero-point and thermal photons. In this manner photons can be
considered as collective elementary excitations of the matter of plates and
electromagnetic field. If the dielectric permittivity depends on temperature
the energy contains additional terms proportional to the derivatives of
dielectric permittivity with respect to temperature, and the quasiparticle
interpretation of the fluctuating field is not possible. The correlation
between energy and free energy is considered. Previous calculations of the
Casimir energy in the framework of the Lifshitz formula at zero temperature and
optical tabulated data supplemented by the Drude model at room temperature are
analysed. It is demonstrated that this quantity is not a good approximation
either for the free energy or the energy. A physical interpretation of this
hybrid quantity is suggested. The contradictory results in the recent
literature on whether the zero-frequency term of the Lifshitz formula for the
perpendicular polarized modes has any effective contribution to the physical
quantities are discussed. Four main approaches to the resolution of this
problem are specified. The precise expressions for entropy of the fluctuating
field between plates made of real metal are obtained, which helps to decide
between the different approaches. The conclusion is that the Lifshitz formula
supplemented by the plasma model and the surface impedance approach are best
suited to describe the thermal Casimir force between real metals.

physical models of language must exist that are efficiently implementable. The
existence requirement is essential because without physical models no
communication or thinking would be possible. Efficient implementability for
creating and reading language expressions is discussed and illustrated with a
quantum mechanical model. The reason for interest in language is that language
expressions can have meaning, either as an informal language or as a formal
language associated with a mathematical or physical theory. It is noted that
any universally applicable physical theory, or coherent theory of physics and
mathematics together, includes in its domain physical models of expressons for
both the informal language used to discuss the theory and expressions of the
theory itself. It follows that there must be formulas in the formal theory that
express some of their own physical properties. Inclusion of intelligent system
in the theory domain means that the theory, e.g., quantum mechanics, must
describe in some sense its own validation. Maps of language expressions into
physical states are discussed as are conditions under which such a map is a
Godel map. The possibility that language is also mathematical is very briefly
discussed.

computation. Our work addresses the problem of constructing quantum circuits to
implement an arbitrary given quantum computation, in the special case of two
qubits. We pursue circuits without ancilla qubits and as small a number of
elementary quantum gates as possible. Our lower bound for worst-case optimal
two-qubit circuits calls for at least 17 gates: 15 one-qubit rotations and 2
CNOTs. To this end, we constructively prove a worst-case upper bound of 23
elementary gates, of which at most 4 (CNOT) entail multi-qubit interactions.
Our analysis shows that synthesis algorithms suggested in previous work,
although more general, entail much larger quantum circuits than ours in the
special case of two qubits. One such algorithm has a worst case of 61 gates of
which 18 may be CNOTs. Our techniques rely on the KAK decomposition from Lie
theory as well as the polar and spectral (symmetric Shur) matrix decompositions
from numerical analysis and operator theory. They are related to the canonical
decomposition of a two-qubit gate with respect to the ``magic basis'' of
phase-shifted Bell states, published previously. We further extend this
decomposition in terms of elementary gates for quantum computation.

paper, we propose a simple game for n players demonstrating this non-local
property of quantum mechanics: While, on the one hand, it is immediately clear
that classical players will lose the game with substantial probability, it can,
on the other hand, always be won by players sharing an entangled quantum state.
The simplicity of the classical analysis of our game contrasts the often quite
involved analysis of previously proposed examples of this type.
  In the second part, aiming at a quantitative characterization of the
non-locality of n-partite quantum states, we consider a general class of
n-player games, where the amount of communication between certain (randomly
chosen) groups of players is measured. Comparing the classical communication
needed for both classical players and quantum players (initially sharing a
given quantum state) to win such a game, a new type of separation results is
obtained. In particular, we show that in order to simulate two separated qubits
of an n-partite GHZ state at least (roughly) log(log(n)) bits of information

(IP) type magnetic trap. Atoms are cooled and trapped in a modified
magneto-optical trap (MOT) consisting of a conventional 2D-MOT in radial
direction and an axial molasses. The radial magnetic field gradient needed for
the operation of the 2D-MOT is provided by the IP trap. A small axial curvature
and offset field provide magnetic confinement and suppress spin-flip losses in
the center of the magnetic trap without altering the performance of the 2D-MOT.
Continuous loading of atoms into the IP trap is provided by radiative leakage
from the MOT to a metastable level which is magnetically trapped and decoupled
from the MOT light. We are able to accumulate 30 times more atoms in the
magnetic trap than in the MOT. The absolute number of $2\times 10^8$~atoms is
limited by inelastic collisions. A model based on rate equations shows good
agreement with our data. Our scheme can also be applied to other atoms with
similar level structure like alkaline earth metals.

quantum information processor and the resultant density matrices reconstructed
using standard quantum state tomography techniques. Their experimental

approach to the macroscopic limit. The quantum predictions are compared and
contrasted with the classical predictions of both Newtonian and Liouville
mechanics. The time-domain scaling of the optimal quantum-classical
correspondence is analyzed in detail in the case of both classical theories. In
both cases the correspondence for observable quantities is shown to break down
on a time-scale that increases very slowly (logarithmically) with increasing
system size. In the case of quantum-Liouville correspondence such a short
time-scale does not imply a breakdown of correspondence since the largest
quantum-Liouville differences reached on this time-scale decrease rapidly (as
an inverse power) with increasing system size. Therefore the statistical
properties of chaotic dynamics are, as expected, well described by quantum
theory in the macroscopic limit. In contrast, the largest quantum-Newtonian
differences reached on the log time-scale actually increase in proportion to
the system size. Since the invariance properties of the Hamiltonian impose
functional constraints on the time-varying chaotic coordinates, it is possible
to show, moreover, that if the quantum predictions are believed to describe the
coordinates of individual chaotic systems, then they also predict macroscopic
violations of any kinematic or dynamic constants of the motion. These results
for chaotic systems indicate that a valid description of the time-varying
properties of individual macroscopic bodies is not available within the
standard interpretive framework of quantum theory.

of two pairs of undeformed position and momentum operators. There are two
configuration spaces. Correspondingly there are two q-perturbation
Hamiltonians, one originates from the perturbation expansion of the potential
in one configuration space, the other one originates from the perturbation
expansion of the kinetic energy in another configuration space.
  In order to establish a general foundation of the q-perturbation theory, two
perturbation equivalence theorems are proved: (I) Equivalence theorem {\it I}:
Perturbation expressions of the q-deformed uncertainty relations calculated by
two pairs of undeformed operators are the same, and the two q-deformed
uncertainty relations undercut Heisenberg's minimal one in the same style. (II)
The general equivalence theorem {\it II}: for {\it any} potential (regular or
singular) the expectation values of two q-perturbation Hamiltonians in the
eigenstates of the undeformed Hamiltonian are equivalent to all orders of the
perturbation expansion. As an example of singular potentials the perturbation
energy spectra of the q-deformed Coulomb potential are studied.

mechanical systems are nevertheless observed to follow the trajectories
predicted by classical mechanics. Hence, in the regime defining macroscopic
physics, the trajectories of the correct classical motion must emerge from
quantum mechanics, a process referred to as the quantum to classical
transition. Extending previous work [Bhattacharya, Habib, and Jacobs, Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 85}, 4852 (2000)], here we elucidate this transition in some
detail, showing that once the measurement processes which affect all
macroscopic systems are taken into account, quantum mechanics indeed predicts
the emergence of classical motion. We derive inequalities that describe the
parameter regime in which classical motion is obtained, and provide numerical
examples. We also demonstrate two further important properties of the classical

second, that classical statistical inference may be used to correctly track the
classical motion.

In the Lamb-Dicke regime, when the motional wave packet is well localized over
the laser wavelenght, transient coherent population trapping occurs, cancelling
transitions at the laser frequency. In this limit the motion can be efficiently
cooled to the ground state of the trapping potential. We derive an equation for

011802 (2000)] according to which the electromagnetically induced absorption
(EIA) resonances observed in degenerate two level systems are due to coherence
transfer from the excited to the ground state is experimentally tested in a
Hanle type experiment observing the parametric resonance on the $% D1$ line of
$^{87}$Rb. While EIA occurs in the $F=1\to F^{\prime}=2 $ transition in a cell
containing only $Rb$ vapor, collisions with a buffer gas ($30 torr$ of $Ne$)
cause the sign reversal of this resonance as a consequence of collisional
decoherence of the excited state. A theoretical model in good qualitative
agreement with the experimental results is presented.

a certain amount of energy. This is arbitrarily small in Classical Physics, due
to the continuous nature of the energy parameter, while one cannot reduce that
amount below Planck's energy quanta in Quantum Physics. In short, one cannot
send less than a photon from a place to another when transmitting a minimum of
information. However, as single photons are never completely defined
simultaneously in all their parameters as position and momentum, their exact
contribution to the information transmitted cannot be known in advance, but
only probabilistically predicted. So the information transmitted is always
blurred before one can - in a way that is only probabilistically predictable -
localize or, alternatively, determine the momenta of the photons transporting
it. In order to enhance the information content of a message, is it then really
possible to exploit the situation by considering the information contained in a
superposition state before localization or, alternatively, determination of
momenta? It would be so if such blurred information were richer than a defined
one, the former being vaguer than the latter as it would be compatible with
more possible outputs, and only in this sense more extensive. But if one
defines the information content of a state as the negative logarithm of the
probability of the state itself, it is not possible to identify the more a
priori probable blurred information pertaining to that state with the bigger
one. Then the idea of exploiting a supposedly enhanced information content of
superposition states in Quantum Computation seems to contradict directly - but,
as we will se, without necessity - the classical probabilistic definition of
information.

operational errors, and quantum error-correcting (QEC) codes are the keys to
solving this problem. Of course, just the existence of codes is not efficient.
It is necessary to perform operations fault-tolerantly on encoded states
because error-correction process (i.e., encoding, decoding, syndrome
measurement and recovery) itself induces an error. By using simulation, this
paper investigates the effects of some important QEC codes (the five qubit
code, the seven qubit code and the nine qubit code) and their fault-tolerant
operations when the error-correction process itself induces an error. The
corresponding results, statistics and analyses are presented in this paper.

gas-filled cylinders. We consider particularly two-level agents such as
electrons immersed in a magnetic field. Work is produced in that case when the
electrons are being carried from a high-magnetic-field region into a
low-magnetic-field region. In watermills, work is produced instead when some
amount of fluid drops from a high-altitude reservoir to a low-altitude
reservoir. We show that this purely mechanical engine may in fact be considered
as a two-level quantum heat engine, provided the fluid is viewed as consisting
of n molecules of weight one and N-n molecules of weight zero. Weight-one
molecules are analogous to electrons in their higher energy state, while
weight-zero molecules are analogous to electrons in their lower energy state.
More generally, fluids consist of non-interacting molecules of various weights.
It is shown that, not only the average value of the work produced per cycle,
but also its fluctuations, are the same for mechanical engines and quantum
(Otto) heat engines. The reversible Carnot cycles are approached through the
consideration of multiple sub-reservoirs.

frequency framework. Such an approach can be interpreted as a contextual
approach to quantum probabilities. By using rather complicated frequency
calculations we reproduce the EPR-Bohm correlation function which is typically
derived by using the calculus of probabilities in a Hilbert space. Our
frequency probabilistic model of the EPR-Bohm experiment is a realist model --
physical observables are considered as objective properties of physical
systems. It is also local -- a measurement over one part of a composite system
does not disturb another part of this system. Nevertheless, our result does not
contradict to the well known Bell's ``NO-GO'' theorem. J. Bell used the
conventional (Kolmogorov) measure-theoretical approach. We use the frequency
approach. In the latter approach there are no reasons to assume that the
simultaneous probability distribution exists: corresponding frequencies may
fluctuate and not approach any definite limit (which Bell would like to use as
the probability). The frequency probabilistic derivation demonstrated that
incompatibility of observables under consideration plays the crucial role in
producing of the EPR-Bohm correlations.

appearance of long-range correlations. These correlations are not due to
thermal fluctuations but to the intricate structure of a strongly entangled
ground state of the system. We present a microscopic computation of the scaling
properties of the ground-state entanglement in several 1D spin chain models
both near and at the quantum critical regimes. We quantify entanglement by
using the entropy of the ground state when the system is traced down to $L$
spins. This entropy is seen to scale logarithmically with $L$, with a
coefficient that corresponds to the central charge associated to the conformal
theory that describes the universal properties of the quantum phase transition.
Thus we show that entanglement, a key concept of quantum information science,
obeys universal scaling laws as dictated by the representations of the
conformal group and its classification motivated by string theory. This
connection unveils a monotonicity law for ground-state entanglement along the
renormalization group flow. We also identify a majorization rule possibly
associated to conformal invariance and apply the present results to interpret
the breakdown of density matrix renormalization group techniques near a
critical point.

of spin variables is equivalent to the original one. In this note we show that
such an opinion is not justified. We apply to the original EPR problem the
method which was used by Bell for the Bohm reformulation. He has shown that
correlation function of two spins cannot be represented by classical
correlation of separated bounded random processes. This Bell`s theorem has been
interpreted as incompatibility of local realism with quantum mechanics. We show
that, in contrast to Bell`s theorem for spin or polarization correlation
functions, the correlation of positions (or momenta) of two particles,
depending on the rotation angles, in the original EPR model always admits a
representation in the form of classical correlation of separated random
processes. In this sense there exists a local realistic representation for the
original EPR model but there is no such a representation for the Bohm spin
reformulation of the EPR paradox. It shows also that the phenomena of quantum
nonlocality is based not only on the properties of entangled states but also on
the using of particular bounded observables.

entanglement and represents a property of intrinsically random systems, not
necessarily quantum. It appears possible to separate the two kinds of

enabling scalable ion-trap quantum computation [D. Kielpinski et al., Nature

are implemented using the Sorensen-Molmer (SM) scheme applied to pairs of ions

directly to the encoded qubits, are capable of further reducing various other
sources of qubit decoherence, such as due to differential dephasing and due to
decohered vibrational modes. The feasibility of using the relatively slow SM

against the decohering effects of photon loss. The scheme preserves quantum
states with a definite parity, and improves previous proposals for decoherence
control in cavities. It is implemented by sending single atoms, one by one,
through the cavity. The atomic state gets first correlated to the photon number
parity. The wrong parity results in an atom in the upper state. The atom in
this state is then used to inject a photon in the mode via adiabatic transfer,
correcting the field parity. By solving numerically the exact master equation

weakly coupled, composite quantum systems is influenced by the chaotic dynamics
of the corresponding classical system, using coupled kicked tops. The linear
entropy for the subsystem (a kicked top) is employed as a measure of
entanglement. A perturbative formula for the entanglement production rate is
derived. The formula contains a correlation function that can be evaluated only
from the information of uncoupled tops. Using this expression and the
assumption that the correlation function decays exponentially which is
plausible for chaotic tops, it is shown that {\it the increment of the strength
of chaos does not enhance the production rate of entanglement} when the
coupling is weak enough and the subsystems (kicked tops) are strongly chaotic.
The result is confirmed by numerical experiments. The perturbative approach is
also applied to a weakly chaotic region, where tori and chaotic sea coexist in
the corresponding classical phase space, to reexamine a recent numerical study
that suggests an intimate relationship between the linear stability of the
corresponding classical trajectory and the entanglement production rate.

the square-root measurement, to minimize the probability of a detection error
when distinguishing between a collection of mixed quantum states. Using this
condition we derive the optimal measurement for state sets with a broad class

  We first consider geometrically uniform (GU) state sets with a possibly
nonabelian generating group, and show that if the generator satisfies a certain
constraint, then the LSM is optimal. In particular, for pure-state GU ensembles
the LSM is shown to be optimal. For arbitrary GU state sets we show that the
optimal measurement operators are GU with generator that can be computed very
efficiently in polynomial time, within any desired accuracy.
  We then consider compound GU (CGU) state sets which consist of subsets that
are GU. When the generators satisfy a certain constraint, the LSM is again
optimal. For arbitrary CGU state sets the optimal measurement operators are
shown to be CGU with generators that can be computed efficiently in polynomial

the dynamical behavior of entanglement is of a great importance. In this paper
we consider a two-mode squeezed vacuum state coupled to one thermal reservoir
as a model of an entangled state embedded in an environment. As a criterion for
entanglement we use a continuous-variable equivalent of the Peres-Horodecki
criterion, namely the Simon criterion. To quantify entanglement we use the
logarithmic negativity. We derive a condition, which assures that the state
remains entangled in spite of the interaction with the reservoir. Moreover for
the case of interaction with vacuum as an environment we show that a state of
interest after intinitely long interaction is not only entangled, but also
pure. For comparison we also consider a model in which each of both modes is
coupled to its own reservoir.

the probability of correct detection for the case in which the rate of

an operator P having the following properties: (i) P is linear and Hermitian;
(ii) P commutes with H; (iii) P^2=1; (iv) the nth eigenstate of H is also an
eigenstate of P with eigenvalue (-1)^n. Given these properties, it is
appropriate to refer to P as the parity operator and to say that H has parity
symmetry, even though P may not refer to spatial reflection. Thus, if the
Hamiltonian has the form H=p^2+V(x), where V(x) is real (so that H possesses
time-reversal symmetry), then it immediately follows that H has PT symmetry.
This shows that PT symmetry is a generalization of Hermiticity: All Hermitian
Hamiltonians of the form H=p^2+V(x) have PT symmetry, but not all PT-symmetric
Hamiltonians of this form are Hermitian.

  Sampling</title><description>  Many quantum algorithms, including Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete
log algorithms, proceed by reduction to a hidden subgroup problem, in which a
subgroup H of a group G must be determined from a quantum state y uniformly
supported on a left coset of H. These hidden subgroup problems are then solved
by Fourier sampling: the quantum Fourier transform of y is computed and
measured. When the underlying group is non-Abelian, two important variants of
the Fourier sampling paradigm have been identified: the weak standard method,
where only representation names are measured, and the strong standard method,
where full measurement occurs. It has remained open whether the strong standard
method is indeed stronger, that is, whether there are hidden subgroups that can
be reconstructed via the strong method but not by the weak, or any other known,
method. In this article, we settle this question in the affirmative. We show
that hidden subgroups of semidirect products of Z_p by Z_q, where q divides
(p-1) and q = p / polylog(p), can be efficiently determined by the strong
standard method. Furthermore, the weak standard method and the ``forgetful''
Abelian method are insufficient for these groups. We extend this to an
information-theoretic solution for the hidden subgroup problem over semidirect
products of Z_p by \Z_q where q divides (p-1) and, in particular, the Affine
groups A_p. Finally, we prove a closure property for the class of groups over
which the hidden subgroup problem can be solved efficiently.

which was concerned with the simplest instance of entangled quantum systems,
pairs of qubits. As in that analysis -- again on the basis of numerical

distinguishability) probability that arbitrarily paired qubits and qutrits are
separable (unentangled) has a simple exact value, u/(v Pi^3)= &gt;.00124706, where
u = 2^20 3^3 5 7 and v = 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 (the product of consecutive

those occuring in the classical potential required? What is the error of the
parametrisation estimated from the numerical fit? How about convergence and
stability of the fitting method (dependence on grid points, resolution, initial

numerical determination of the quantum action: (i) global fit of the Q.M.
transition amplitudes and (ii) flow equation. As model we consider the inverse
square potential, for which the Q.M. transition amplitudes are analytically
known. We find that the relative error of the parametrisation starts from zero
at T=0 increases to about $10^{-3}$ at $T=1/E_{gr}$ and then decreases to zero
when $T \to \infty$. Second, we observe stability of the quantum action under
variation of the control parameters. Finally, the flow equation method works
well in the regime of large $T$ giving stable results under variation of
initial data and consistent with the global fit method.

  water-filled nanotubes manifest quantum optical coherence interfering with
  the normal QBD?</title><description>  Recent discovery by Perutz et al. of the physical structure of the amyloid
that accumulates in neurons in certain neurodegenerative diseases like
Alzheimer's disease or Huntington's disease, suggests novel mechanism of
consciousness impairment, different from the neuronal loss, which is the end
stage of the pathogenic process. Amyloid is shown to be water-filled nanotubes
made of polymerized pathologically-changed proteins. It is hypothesized that
the water inside the new-formed nanotubes can manifest optical coherent
laser-like excitations and superradiance similarly to the processes taking part
in the normal brain microtubules as shown by Jibu et al. The interfering with
the macroscopic quantum effects within the normal microtubules can lead to
impairment of conscious experience. Experimental data in favor of quantum
theory of consciousness can be obtained from the research of the amyloid
nanotubes.

only if protected against decoherence. A two-particle four-state system may
have two-dimensional subspaces that are partially or completely
decoherence-free, e.g., the symmetric triplet state as an example of the
former, the anti-symmetric singlet state of the latter. By extension, a
multiparticle system that in the laboratory basis is plagued by decoherence may
in some other basis exhibit the symmetries that yield such decoherence-free
subspaces (DFS's). Fully-interacting many-fermion spin 1/2 networks may be
mathematically transformed to a more tractable many-to-one (or -to-some)
variant. This paper applies such a transformation to a hypothetical network of
boson-like operators and then argues that a fully-interacting particle
number-preserving network of bosons plus fermions with supersymmetric degrees
of freedom may be more plausibly exploited so as to contain DFS's. Physical
systems that in some basis are inherently anti-symmetric are already known to
be useful for quantum information processing. Supersymmetric systems may be
likewise.

circuits. While it is known that in general a quantum algorithm based on
comparisons alone cannot outperform classical sorting algorithms by more than a
constant factor in time complexity, this is wrong in a space bounded setting.
We observe that for all storage bounds n/\log n\ge S\ge \log^3 n, one can
devise a quantum algorithm that sorts n numbers (using comparisons only) in
time T=O(n^{3/2}\log^{3/2} n/\sqrt S). We then show the following lower bound
on the time-space tradeoff for sorting $n$ numbers from a polynomial size range
in a general sorting algorithm (not necessarily based on comparisons):
TS=\Omega(n^{3/2}). Hence for small values of S the upper bound is almost
tight. Classically the time-space tradeoff for sorting is TS=\Theta(n^2).

non-trivial case of a rotating (Kerr) black hole solution. Following a prior
work by Barvinsky, Das and Kunstatter, we are able to express the area spectrum
in terms of an integer-valued quantum number and an angular-momentum operator.
Moreover, by using an analogy between the Kerr black hole and a quantum
rotator, we are able to quantize the angular-momentum sector. We find the area
spectrum to be $A_{n,J_{cl}}=8\pi\hbar(n+J_{cl}+1/2)$, where $n$ and $J_{cl}$
are both integers. The quantum number $J_{cl}$ is related to but distinct from
the eigenvalue $j$ of the angular momentum of the black hole. Actually, it
represents the ``classical'' angular momentum and, for $J_{cl}\gg 1$,
$J_{cl}\approx j$.

inductively coupled to electromagnetic circuitry. We show how this system can

The usual ways to do so rely on technicalities which may hide important

Renormalization or particular mathematical prescriptions are not invoked. The
simple formulation of the method makes it easy to extend to more general
contexts, such as for lattices of $N$ general point interactions; on a line; on
a half-line; under periodic boundary conditions; and confined in a box.

experimentally-realised asymmetric dots produce photons entangled in both

photons. We consider a biexciton with non-degenerate intermediate excitonic
states in a leaky optical cavity with pairs of degenerate cavity modes close to
the non-degenerate exciton transition frequencies. An open quantum system
approach is used to compute the polarisation entanglement of the two-photon
state after it escapes from the cavity, measured by the visibility of
two-photon interference fringes. We explicitly relate the two-photon visibility
to the degree of Bell-inequality violation, deriving a threshold at which
Bell-inequality violations will be observed. Our results show that an ideal
cavity will produce maximally polarisation-entangled photon pairs, and even a
non-ideal cavity will produce partially entangled photon pairs capable of

quantum algorithms which achieve exponential advantage over classical
computation and lies at the heart of the solution to the abelian hidden
subgroup problem, of which Shor's celebrated factoring and discrete log
algorithms are a special case. We begin by addressing various computational
issues surrounding the QFT and give improved parallel circuits for both the QFT
over a power of 2 and the QFT over an arbitrary cyclic group. These circuits
are based on new insight into the relationship between the discrete Fourier
transform over different cyclic groups. We then exploit this insight to extend
the class of hidden subgroup problems with efficient quantum solutions. First
we relax the condition that the underlying hidden subgroup function be distinct
on distinct cosets of the subgroup in question and show that this relaxation
can be solved whenever G is a finitely-generated abelian group. We then extend
this reasoning to the hidden cyclic subgroup problem over the reals, showing
how to efficiently generate the bits of the period of any sufficiently
piecewise-continuous function on R. Finally, we show that this problem of
period-finding over R, viewed as an oracle promise problem, is strictly harder
than its integral counterpart. In particular, period-finding over R lies
outside the complexity class MA, a class which contains period-finding over the
integers.

and momenta, quantum evolution may be mapped onto a classical Hamiltonian
system. In addition to the symplectic form, quantum mechanics also has a
positive-definite real inner product which provides a geometrical
interpretation of the measurement process. Together they endow the quantum
Hilbert space with the structure of a K\&quot;{a}ller manifold. Quantum control is
discussed in this setting. Quantum time-evolution corresponds to smooth
Hamiltonian dynamics and measurements to jumps in the phase space. This adds
additional power to quantum control, non unitarily controllable systems
becoming controllable by ``measurement plus evolution''. A picture of quantum
evolution as Hamiltonian dynamics in a classical-like phase-space is the
appropriate setting to carry over techniques from classical to quantum control.
This is illustrated by a discussion of optimal control and sliding mode
techniques.

Dynamics of such a particle can be described by one generalization of the
kicked rotor. In comparison with the kicked rotor, this generalization is shown
to have a much larger parametric space for existence of the modes. Using this

is greatly enhanced when low order resonances are exposed at the border of
chaos. We also present signature of the enhanced transport in the quantum

ion traps is discussed, in which a force is used to give a controlled push to a
pair of trapped ions and thus realize a phase gate. The original proposal had a
weakness in that it involved a hidden extreme sensitivity to the size of the
force. Also, the physical origin of this force was not fully addressed. Here,
we discuss the sensitivity and present a way to avoid it by choosing the
spatial form of the pushing force in an optimal way. We also analyse the effect
of imperfections in a pair of pi pulses which are used to implement a
&quot;spin-echo&quot; to cancel correlated errors. We present a physical model for the
force, namely the dipole force, and discuss the impact of unwanted photon
scattering, and of finite temperature of the ions. The main effect of the
temperature is to blur the phase of the gate owing to the ions exploring a
range of values of the force. When the distance scale of the force profile is
smaller than the ion separation, this effect is more important than the
high-order terms in the Coulomb repulsion which were originally discussed.
Overall, we find that whereas the &quot;pushing gate&quot; is not as resistant to
imperfections as was supposed, it remains a significant candidate for ion trap
quantum computing since it does not require ground state cooling, and in some
cases it does not require the Lamb-Dicke limit, while the gate rate is fast,
close to (rather than small compared to) the trap vibrational frequency.

the statistical distinguishability of a given state with the closest
disentangled state that has the same reductions as the primary state. In
particular, we concentrate on the relative entropy of entanglement with
reversed entries. We show that this quantity is an entanglement monotone which
is strongly additive, thereby demonstrating that monotonicity under local
quantum operations and strong additivity are compatible in principle. In
accordance with the presented statistical interpretation which is provided,
this entanglement monotone, however, has the property that it diverges on pure
states, with the consequence that it cannot distinguish the degree of
entanglement of different pure states. We also prove that the relative entropy
of entanglement with respect to the set of disentangled states that have
identical reductions to the primary state is an entanglement monotone. We
finally investigate the trace-norm measure and demonstrate that it is also a
proper entanglement monotone.

combined system &quot;a two-level atom + a single-mode quantized field + a
standing-wave ideal cavity&quot;. We derive Hamilton -- Schr\&quot;odinger equations for
probability amplitudes and averaged position and momentum of a point-like atom
interacting with the quantized field in a standing-wave cavity. They
constitute, in general, an infinite-dimensional set of equations with an
infinite number of integrals of motion which may be reduced to a dynamical
system with four degrees of freedom if the quantized field is supposed to be
initially prepared in a Fock state. This system is found to produce semiquantum
chaos with positive values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. At large values of
detuning $|\delta|\gg 1$, the Rabi atomic oscillations are usually shallow, and
the dynamics is found to be almost regular. The Doppler -- Rabi resonance, deep
Rabi oscillations that may occur at any large value of $|\delta|$ to be equal
to $|\alpha p_0|$, is found numerically and described analytically (with
$\alpha$ to be the normalized recoil frequency and $p_0$ the initial atomic
momentum). Two gedanken experiments are proposed to detect manifestations of
semiquantum chaos in real experiments. In the chaotic regime values of the
population inversion $z_{out}$, measured with atoms after transversing a
cavity, are so sensitive to small changes in the initial inversion $z_{in}$
that the probability of detecting any value of $z_{out}$ in the admissible
interval becomes almost unity in a short time. Chaotic wandering of a two-level
atom in a quantized Fock field is shown to be fractal. Fractal-like structures,
typical for chaotic scattering, are numerically found in the dependence of the
time of exit of atoms from the cavity on their initial momenta.

compared highlighting differences and analogies. We discuss quantitatively and
qualitatively the conditions under which the counter rotating terms can be

appropriate tool to describe three-level systems. The rather unusual properties
of this phase are caused by the small dimension of the system and are explored
in detail. When a three-level atom interacts with a quantum field in a cavity,
a polynomial deformation of this algebra emerges in a natural way. We also
introduce a polar decomposition of the atom-field relative amplitudes that
leads to a Hermitian relative-phase operator, whose eigenstates correctly
describe the corresponding phase properties. We claim that this is the natural

We find the probability distribution for this variable and study its time

$b_0$ and the short range correlation parameter $y$ which originates from a
Jastrow correlation function. It is found that the information entropy sum for
a nucleus depends only on the correlation parameter $y$ through the simple
relation $S= s_{0A} + s_{1A} y^{-\lambda_{sA}}$, where $s_{0A}$, $s_{1A}$ and
$\lambda_{sA}$ depend on the mass number $A$. A similar approximate expression
is also valid for the root mean square radius of the nucleus as function of $y$
leading to an approximate expression which connects $S$ with the root mean

like the entanglement of distillation can become infinite. This leads naturally
to the question, whether one system in such an infinitely entangled state can
serve as a resource for tasks like the teleportation of arbitrarily many
qubits. We show that appropriate states cannot be obtained by density operators
in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. However, using techniques for the
description of infinitely many degrees of freedom from field theory and
statistical mechanics, such states can nevertheless be constructed rigorously.
We explore two related possibilities, namely an extended notion of algebras of

operators. As applications we construct the essentially unique infinite
analogue of maximally entangled states, and the singular state used
heuristically in the fundamental paper of Einstein, Rosen and Podolsky.

implemented by a separable super-operator, and develop techniques for
calculating the extreme points of POVMs under a certain class of constraint
that includes separability and PPT-ness. As examples we consider measurements
that are invariant under various symmetry groups (Werner, Isotropic,
Bell-diagonal, Local Orthogonal), and demonstrate that in these cases
separability of the POVM elements is equivalent to implementability via LOCC.
We also calculate the extrema of these classes of measurement under the groups
that we consider, and give explicit LOCC protocols for attaining them. These
protocols are hence optimal methods for locally discriminating between states
of these symmetries. One of many interesting consequences is that the best way
to locally discriminate Bell diagonal mixed states is to perform a 2-outcome
POVM using local von Neumann projections. This is true regardless of the cost
function, the number of states being discriminated, or the prior probabilities.
Our results give the first cases of local mixed state discrimination that can
be analysed quantitatively in full, and may have application to other problems
such as demonstrations of non-locality, experimental entanglement witnesses,

foundations of theoretical physics. The acquisition of information from a
quantum system is the interface of classical and quantum physics. Essential
tools for its description are Kraus matrices and positive operator valued
measures (POVMs). Special relativity imposes severe restrictions on the
transfer of information between distant systems. Quantum entropy is not a
Lorentz covariant concept. Lorentz transformations of reduced density matrices
for entangled systems may not be completely positive maps. Quantum field
theory, which is necessary for a consistent description of interactions,
implies a fundamental trade-off between detector reliability and
localizability. General relativity produces new, counterintuitive effects, in
particular when black holes (or more generally, event horizons) are involved.
Most of the current concepts in quantum information theory may then require a

random bits at optical speeds. A and B possess true-random physical sources and
exchange random bits by using a random sequence received to cipher the

force, with the magnetic field operator modified to include quantum corrections
due to anomolous commutation relations. Expectation values for stationary
states are calculated. Nonstationary states are treated by integrating the
force operator in time to obtain the impulse operator. Expectation values of
the impulse are calculated for slow wavepackets (which spread faster than they
move) and for fast wavepackets (which spread only negligibly before their

some fidelity. We first obtain simple expressions for the fidelity of quantum

an arbitrary Heisenberg ferromagnet using our scheme. We then apply this to the
realizable case of an open ended chain with nearest neighbor interactions. The
fidelity of quantum state transfer is obtained as an inverse discrete cosine

analyze the behaviour of the CCN criterion under local operations and identify
the operations that leave it invariant. It turns out that the CCN criterion is

For $d =o(n/\log n)$ this running time is bounded by $\O(2^{n(1/3+\epsilon)})$

  quantum dot excitons</title><description>  We propose to measure the superradiance effect by observing the current
through a semiconductor double-dot ststem. An electron and a hole are injected
separately into one of the quantum dots to form an exciton and then recombine
radiatively. We find that the stationary current shows oscillatory behavior as
one varies the inter-dot distance. The amplitude of oscillation can be
increased by incorporating the system into a microcavity. Furthermore, the
current is suppressed if the dot distance is small compared to the wavelength
of the emitted photon. This photon trapping phenomenon generates the entangled
state and may be used to control the emission of single photons at

  POVM measurement</title><description>  We apply algorithmic information theory to quantum mechanics in order to shed
light on an algorithmic structure which inheres in quantum mechanics.
  There are two equivalent ways to define the (classical) Kolmogorov complexity
K(s) of a given classical finite binary string s. In the standard way, K(s) is
defined as the length of the shortest input string for the universal
self-delimiting Turing machine to output s. In the other way, we first
introduce the so-called universal probability m, and then define K(s) as -log_2
m(s) without using the concept of program-size. We generalize the universal
probability to a matrix-valued function, and identify this function with a POVM
(positive operator-valued measure). On the basis of this identification, we
study a computable POVM measurement with countable measurement outcomes
performed upon a finite dimensional quantum system. We show that, up to a
multiplicative constant, 2^{-K(s)} is the upper bound for the probability of
each measurement outcome s in such a POVM measurement. In what follows, the
upper bound 2^{-K(s)} is shown to be optimal in a certain sense.

classical information must still travel at $c$, though in the latter case the
origin of local spacetime itself is a puzzle. We consider the properties of

reactions macroscopic fluctuations is studied. The issue is viewed with respect
to the necessary conditions for a long-term stable evolution of any natural and
artificial system. It is shown that global coupling of the local fluctuations
is necessary for providing a long-term stability of the system. A successful
coupling mechanism is achieved on the grounds of new assumptions about the
Hamiltonian response to certain perturbations. The coupling mechanism acts
towards a global synchronisation, i.e. to a coherent response of the excited
species to any further perturbation. It is proven that the synchronisation is a
scale-free process that has universal properties, e.g. it is insensitive to the
chemical identity of the reacting species and to the particularities of the
surface reaction. Its hallmark is that the global adsorption rate exhibits
permanent temporal variations whose amplitude is independent of the system
size.
  The presence of these fluctuations fundamentally changes the temporal
behavior of the system, namely it becomes pulse-like both on the quantum and
the macro-level. The pulse-like behavior gives rise to a persistent continuous
band at the quantum spectra whose major properties are: (I) it does not
correspond to any real radiation; (ii) its presence is insensitive to the
particularities of the system and the incident radiation; (iii) its shape and
the infrared edge are typical for the -type noise. These properties give rise
to its name: alias -type noise.

decoherence due to the many extra degrees of freedom of a solid state system.
We investigate a system of two solid state qubits that are coupled via
$\sigma_z^{(i)} \otimes \sigma_z^{(j)}$ type of coupling. This kind of setup is
typical for {\em pseudospin} solid-state quantum bits such as charge or flux
systems. We evaluate decoherence properties and gate quality factors in the
presence of a common and two uncorrelated baths coupling to $\sigma_z$,
respectively. We show that at low temperatures, uncorrelated baths do degrade
the gate quality more severely. In particular, we show that in the case of a
common bath, optimum gate performance of a CPHASE gate can be reached at very
low temperatures, because our type of coupling commutes with the coupling to
the decoherence, which makes this type of coupling attractive as compared to
previously studied proposals with $\sigma_y^{(i)} \otimes \sigma_y^{(j)}$
-coupling. Although less pronounced, this advantage also applies to the CNOT

expression is a function of both time, $t$, and Planck's constant, $\hbar$, and
allows a study of both the long time, $t\to\infty$, and semi-classical,
$\hbar\to 0$, limits taken in either order. We evaluate the expression using
random matrix theory as well as numerically, and observe good agreement between
both sets of results. The long time limit shows that particle transport is
generically ballistic, for any fixed value of Planck's constant. However, for
fixed times, the semi-classical limit leads to diffusion. The mean square
displacement for non-zero Planck's constant, and finite time, exhibits a
crossover from diffusive to ballistic motion, with crossover time on the order
of the inverse of Planck's constant. We argue, that these results are generic
for a large class of 1D quantum random walks, similar to the quantum
multi-baker, and that a sufficient condition for diffusion in the
semi-classical limit is classically chaotic dynamics in each cell. Some

partial Trace): given a tensor formula F over a subsemiring of the complex
field (C,+,.) plus a positive integer k, under the restrictions that all inputs
are column vectors of L2-norm 1 and norm-preserving square matrices, and that
the output matrix is a column vector, decide whether the k-partial trace of
$F\dagg{F}$ is superior to 1/2. The k-partial trace of a matrix is the sum of
its lowermost k diagonal elements. We also consider the promise version of this
problem, where the 1/2 threshold is an isolated cutpoint. We show how to encode
a quantum or reversible gate array into a tensor formula which satisfies the
above conditions, and vice-versa; we use this to show that the promise version
of SFT is complete for the class BPP for formulas over the semiring (Q^+,+,.)
of the positive rational numbers, for BQP in the case of formulas defined over
the field (Q,+,.), and for P in the case of formulas defined over the Boolean
semiring, all under logspace-uniform reducibility. This suggests that the
difference between probabilistic and quantum polynomial-time computers may
ultimately lie in the possibility, in the latter case, of having destructive
interference between computations occuring in parallel.

from decoherence of single-spin systems. The difference originates at the most
basic level, being determined by parity of the central system, i.e. by whether
the system comprises even or odd number of spin-1/2 entities. Therefore, it is
very likely that similar distinction between the central spin systems of even

clarifies the physical origin of the unusual two-step decoherence found
previously in the two-spin systems.

give rise to entanglement measures. It is well known that asymptotic local
operations and classical communication (LOCC) are required to get a simple
operational measure of bipartite pure state entanglement. For bipartite mixed
states and multipartite pure states it is likely that a more powerful class of
operations will be needed. To this end \cite{BPRST01} have defined more
powerful versions of state transformations (or reducibilities), namely LOCCq
(asymptotic LOCC with a sublinear amount of quantum communication) and CLOCC
(asymptotic LOCC with catalysis). In this paper we show that {\em LOCCq state
transformations are only as powerful as asymptotic LOCC state transformations}
for multipartite pure states. We first generalize the concept of entanglement
gambling from two parties to multiple parties: any pure multipartite entangled
state can be transformed to an EPR pair shared by some pair of parties and that
any irreducible $m$ $(m\ge 2)$ party pure state can be used to create any other
state (pure or mixed), using only local operations and classical communication
(LOCC). We then use this tool to prove the result. We mention some applications
of multipartite entanglement gambling to multipartite distillability and to
characterizations of multipartite minimal entanglement generating sets. Finally
we discuss generalizations of this result to mixed states by defining the class
of {\em cat distillable states}.

to the Lindblad master equation. In case of non-minimally disturbing

driving the pursuit for its practical realization by various physical
techniques. Currently Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) has been the forerunner
by demonstrating a majority of quantum algorithms. In NMR, spin systems
consisting of coupled nuclear spins are utilized as qubits. In order to carry
out QIP, a spin system has to meet two major requirements: (i) qubit
addressability and (ii) mutual coupling among the qubits. It has been
demonstrated that the magnitude of the mutual coupling among qubits can be
increased by orienting the spin-systems in a liquid crystal matrix and
utilizing the residual dipolar couplings. While utilizing residual dipolar
couplings may be useful to increase the number of qubits, nuclei of same
species (homonuclei) might become strongly coupled. In strongly coupled
spin-systems, spins loose their individual identity of being qubits. We propose
that even such strongly coupled spin-systems can be used for QIP and the
qubit-manipulation can be achieved by transition-selective pulses. We

  for a Metal?</title><description>  The finite temperature Casimir free energy, entropy, and internal energy are
considered anew for a conventional parallel-plate configuration, in the light
of current discussions in the literature. In the case of an &quot;ideal&quot; metal,
characterized by a refractive index equal to infinity for all frequencies, we
recover, via a somewhat unconventional method, conventional results for the
temperature dependence, meaning that the zero-frequency transverse electric
mode contributes the same as the transverse magnetic mode. For a real metal,
however, approximately obeying the Drude dispersive model at low frequencies,
we find that the zero-frequency transverse electric mode does not contribute at
all. This would appear to lead to an observable temperature dependence and a
violation of the third law of thermodynamics. It had been suggested that the
source of the difficulty was the behaviour of the reflection coefficient for
perpendicular polarization but we show that this is not the case. By
introducing a simplified model for the Casimir interaction, consisting of two
harmonic oscillators interacting via a third one, we illustrate the behavior of
the transverse electric field. Numerical results are presented based on the
refractive index for gold. A linear temperature correction to the Casimir force
between parallel plates is indeed found which should be observable in
room-temperature experiments, but this does not entail any thermodynamic
inconsistency.

experiments, that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with local realism and
there is the so called quantum non-locality. We show that such a claim can be
justified only in a simplified approach to quantum mechanics when one neglects
the fundamental fact that there exist space and time. Mathematical definitions
of local realism in the sense of Bell and in the sense of Einstein are given.
We demonstrate that if we include into the quantum mechanical formalism the
space-time structure in the standard way then quantum mechanics might be
consistent with Einstein's local realism. It shows that loopholes are
unavoidable in experiments aimed to establish a violation of Bell`s
inequalities. We show how the space-time structure can be considered from the
contextual point of view. A mathematical framework for the contextual approach
is outlined.

the quantum parallelism in quantum computing underlies efficient quantum
algorithms, the quantum parallelism in quantum information theory underlies
this, classically unexpected, increase of the fidelity.

generalize the Bender-Dunne polynomials to all the Type A N-fold supersymmetric

there is a case where weak orthogonality of them is not guaranteed, this fact
does not cause any difficulty on the generalization. It is shown that the
anti-commutator of the Type A N-fold supercharges is expressed as the critical
polynomial of them in the original Hamiltonian, from which we establish the

completeness) is replaced by a new hypothesis that associates different dense

in quantum theory, and some quantum information applications. It starts with a
review of quantum contextuality and non-locality, multipartite entanglement
characterisation, and of a few quantum information protocols.
  Quantum non-locality and contextuality are shown to be essential for
different implementations of quantum information protocols known as quantum
random access codes and quantum communication complexity protocols. I derive
sufficient experimental conditions for tests of these quantum properties.
  I also discuss how the distribution of quantum information through quantum
cloning processes can be useful in quantum computing. Regarding entanglement
characterisation, some results are obtained relating two problems, that of
additivity of the relative entropy of entanglement, and that of identifying
different types of tripartite entanglement in the asymptotic regime of
manipulations of many copies of a given state.
  The thesis ends with a description of an information processing task in which
a single qubit substitutes for an arbitrarily large amount of classical
communication. This result is interpreted in different ways: as a gap between
quantum and classical computation space complexity; as a bound on the amount of
classical communication necessary to simulate entanglement; and as a basic
result on hidden-variable theories for quantum mechanics. I also show that the
advantage of quantum over classical communication can be established in a
feasible experiment.

approach any finite-dimensional Hilbert space describes a quantum system.
Though such a treatment might be a convenient approximation it can not be

 I present a list from seven basic postulates of axiomatic quantum mechanics.
In particular the list includes the axiom describing spatial properties of

a relativistic Breit-Wigner line shape, is represented by a generalized state
vector (ket) which can be obtained by analytic extension of the relativistic
Lippmann-Schwinger kets. These Gamow kets span an irreducible representation
space for Poincar\'e transformations which, similar to the Wigner
representations for stable particles, are characterized by spin (angular
momentum of the partial wave amplitude) and complex mass (position of the

of the Lippmann-Schwinger plane wave scattering states, form only a semigroup
of Poincar\'e transformations into the forward light cone. Their transformation
properties are derived. From these one obtains an unambiguous definition of
resonance mass and width for relativistic resonances. The physical

does not distinguish mathematically between the space of states (in-states of

subspaces which are dense in the same Hilbert space and analytic in the lower

axiom the dynamical equations (Schr\&quot;{o}dinger or Heisenberg) integrate to a

Our approach reveals how inequivalent multipartite entangled classes of pure

Moreover, the generic entangled class of the maximal dimension, given by the

available, the inclusion of a description of spin in the development is natural
and may bring about a profound understanding of the mathematical structure of
fundamental physics. A program to attempt this is laid out here. Concepts from
a known quantum-geometrical theory are reviewed: (1) Classical physics is
replaced by a suitable geometry as a fundamental starting point for quantum
mechanics. (2) In this context, a resolution is found for the enigma of
wave-particle duality. (3) It is shown how to couple the quantum density to the
geometrical density. (4) The mechanical gauge is introduced to allow
dimensional reduction. (5) Absolute geometrical equivalence is enforced. The
concordant five-dimensional quantum-geometrical theory is summarized to provide
an orderly basis for the introduction of spinors. It is supposed that the
Pauli--Dirac theory is adaptable. A search is begun for a description that will
generate spinors as a natural tangent space. Interactions other than gravity

be weak effects for electrons.

  microcrystallites coupled by a cavity field</title><description>  The entanglement of excitonic states in a system of $N$ spatially separated
semiconductor microcrystallites is investigated. The interaction among the
different microcrystallites is mediated by a single-mode cavity field. It is
found that the symmetric sharing of the entanglement (measured by the
concurrence) between any pair of the excitonic state with $N$ qubits defined by
the number states (vacuum and a single-exciton states) or the coherent states
(odd and even coherent states) can be prepared by the cavity field for this
system.

  Model</title><description>  Chaotic evolutions exhibit exponential sensitivity to initial conditions.
This suggests that even very small perturbations resulting from weak coupling
of a quantum chaotic environment to the position of a system whose state is a
non-local superposition will lead to rapid decoherence. However, it is also
known that quantum counterparts of classically chaotic systems lose exponential
sensitivity to initial conditions, so this expectation of enhanced decoherence
is by no means obvious. We analyze decoherence due to a &quot;toy&quot; quantum
environment that is analytically solvable, yet displays the crucial phenomenon
of exponential sensitivity to perturbations. We show that such an environment,
with a single degree of freedom, can be far more effective at destroying
quantum coherence than a heat bath with infinitely many degrees of freedom.
This also means that the standard &quot;quantum Brownian motion&quot; model for a
decohering environment may not be as universally applicable as it once was
conjectured to be.

Casimir force between dispersing and absorbing multilayered plates in the
zero-temperature limit has been studied within a 1D quantization scheme for the
electromagnetic field in the presence of causal media [R. Esquivel-Sirvent, C.
Villarreal, and G.H. Cocoletzi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 64, 052108 (2001)]. In the
present paper a rigorous 3D analysis is given, which shows that for complex
heterostructures the 1D theory only roughly reflects the dependence of the
Casimir force on the plate separation in general. Further, an extension of the
very recently derived formula for the Casimir force at zero temperature [M.S.
Toma\v{s}, Phys. Rev. A 66, 052103 (2002)] to finite temperatures is given, and
analytical expressions for specific distance laws in the zero-temperature limit
are derived. In particular, it is shown that the Casimir force between two
single-slab plates behaves asymptotically like $d^{-6}$ in place of $d^{-4}$
($d$, plate separation).

quantum mechanically. As a generic model we use a point-contact detector
coupled to an electron in a quantum dot and tunneling into the continuum.
Transition to the classical description and the mechanism of decoherence are
investigated. We concentrate on the influence of the measurement on the
electron decay rate to the continuum. We demonstrate that the Zeno (or the
anti-Zeno) effect requires a nonuniform density of states in the continuum. In
this case we show that the anti-Zeno effect relates only to the average decay
rate, whereas for sufficiently small time the Zeno effect always takes place.
We discuss the experimental consequences of our results and the role of the
projection postulate in a measurement process.

propagation modes of a dissipative optical lattice. Such a mode has been
excited by applying a moving potential modulation with phase velocity equal to
the velocity of the mode. Its amplitude has been characterized by the
center-of-mass (CM) velocity of the atomic cloud. At Brillouin resonance, we
studied the CM-velocity as a function of the optical pumping rate at a given
depth of the potential wells. We have observed a resonant dependence of the CM
velocity on the optical pumping rate, corresponding to the noise strength. This
corresponds to the experimental observation of stochastic resonance in a
periodic potential in the low-damping regime.

mode results in a resonance in the probe transmission spectrum while in the
other configuration no modification of the scattering spectrum occurs, i.e. the
mode is dark. A theoretical explanation of this behaviour is provided.

Bose-Einstein condensate is theoretically examined, focusing on stimulated
Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from an atomic to a stable molecular
condensate. In particular, Drummond et al. [Phys. Rev. A 65, 063619 (2002);

the efficiency of collective atom-molecule STIRAP, and that optimizing the

  Quantum States with Strong Imperfection in Unperturbed Energies</title><description>  A random matrix theory approach is applied in order to analyze the
localization properties of local spectral density for a generic system of
coupled quantum states with strong static imperfection in the unperturbed
energy levels. The system is excited by an external periodic field, the
temporal profile of which is close to monochromatic one. The shape of local
spectral density is shown to be well described by the contour obtained from a
relevant model of periodically driven two-states system with irreversible
losses to an external thermal bath. The shape width and the inverse
participation ratio are determined as functions both of the Rabi frequency and
of parameters specifying the localization effect for our system in the absence
of external field.

  attack over a realistic channel</title><description>  The security of two-state quantum key distribution against individual attack
is estimated when the channel has losses and noises. We assume that Alice and
Bob use two nonorthogonal single-photon polarization states. To make our
analysis simple, we propose a modified B92 protocol in which Alice and Bob make
use of inconclusive results and Bob performs a kind of symmetrization of
received states. Using this protocol, Alice and Bob can estimate Eve's
information gain as a function of a few parameters which reflect the
imperfections of devices or Eve's disturbance. In some parameter regions, Eve's
maximum information gain shows counter-intuitive behavior, namely, it decreases
as the amount of disturbances increases. For a small noise rate Eve can extract
perfect information in the case where the angle between Alice's two states is
small or large, while she cannot extract perfect information for intermediate
angles. We also estimate the secret key gain which is the net growth of the
secret key per one pulse. We show the region where the modified B92 protocol
over a realistic channel is secure against individual attack.

filtering, and we can bound the amount of phase errors from the observed bit
errors by an estimation method involving nonorthogonal measurements. The angle
between the two states shows a trade-off between accuracy of the estimation and
robustness to noises.

obtained by a rapid change of an atomic parameter such as its transition
frequency, due to the action of some external agent. The electromagnetic field
fluctuations around the atom, averaged over the solid angle for simplicity, are
calculated as a function of time, and it is shown that the interaction energy

processed using quantum resources such as entangled states, local operations
and classical communications. Two important protocols in quantum communications
are quantum teleportation and remote state preparation. In quantum
teleportation neither the sender nor the receiver know the identity of a state.
In remote state preparation the sender knows the state which is to be remotely
prepared without ever physically sending the object or the complete classical
description of it. Using one unit of entanglement and one classical bit Alice
can remotely prepare a photon (from special ensemble) of her choice at Bob's
laboratory. In remote state measurement Alice asks Bob to simulate any single
particle measurement statistics on an arbitrary photon. In this talk we will
present these ideas and discuss the latest developments and future open
problems.
