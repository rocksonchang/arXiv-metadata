coding theorem or the source coding theorem, are restricted to scenarios where
the underlying resources are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
over a large number of uses. To overcome this limitation, two different
techniques, the information spectrum method and the smooth entropy framework,
have been developed independently. They are based on new entropy measures,
called spectral entropy rates and smooth entropies, respectively, that
generalize Shannon entropy (in the classical case) and von Neumann entropy (in
the more general quantum case). Here, we show that the two techniques are
closely related. More precisely, the spectral entropy rate can be seen as the
asymptotic limit of the smooth entropy. Our results apply to the quantum
setting and thus include the classical setting as a special case.

oscillator enhanced by an interaction between them and a $\delta$-pulse
sequence is studied, with the decoherence due to their coupling with a
Markovian bath. Without the Markovian bath, the entanglement is enhanced to
maximum possible values. With the Markovian bath, the entanglement is enhanced
up to some time and then dissipated, with the system in thermal equilibrium
with the Markovian bath after a very long time. The time for achieving the
maximum entanglement shows discontinuous jumps over the parameters of

any lower bound, thus making the system quantum mechanically unstable.
Self-adjointness and renormalization techniques usually provide the system a
scale and thus making the ground state bounded from below. We on the other hand
use noncommutative quantum mechanics and exploit the noncommutative parameter
\Theta as a scale for a scale symmetric system. The resulting Hamiltonian for
the system then allows an unusual bound state at the threshold of the energy,
E=0. Apart from the Hamiltonian \hat{H} we also compute the other two
generators of the so(2,1) algebra, the dilation \hat{D} and the conformal
generator \hat{K} in the noncommutative space. The so(2,1) algebra is not
closed in the noncommutative space, but the limit \Theta\to 0 smoothly goes to
the so(2,1) algebra restoring the conformal symmetry. We also discuss the
system for large noncommutative parameter.

radiofrequency (rf) coupling of state-dependent lattice potentials. This rf
dressing changes the unit cell of the lattice at a subwavelength scale, such
that its curvature and topology departs strongly from that of a simple
sinusoidal lattice potential. Radiofrequency dressing has previously been
performed at length scales from mm to tens of microns, but not at the

it is the fastest rate at which a quantum state can be sent between two parties
who share arbitrary side-information. Likewise, the entanglement of formation
and entanglement cost is shown to be the fastest rate at which a quantum state
can be sent when the parties have access to side-information which is maximally
correlated. A further restriction on the type of side-information implies that
the rate of state transmission is given by the quantum mutual information. This
suggests a new paradigm for understanding entanglement and other correlations.
Different types of side-information correspond to different types of
correlations with the squashed entanglement being one extreme. The paradigm
also allows one to classify states not only in terms of how much quantum
communication is needed to transfer half of it, but also in terms of how much
entanglement is needed. Furthermore, there is a dual paradigm: if one
distributes the side-information as maliciously as possible so as to make the
sending of the state as difficult as possible, one finds maximum rates which
give interpretations to known quantities (such as the entanglement of
assistance), as well as new ones. The infamous additivity questions can also be
recast and receive an operational interpretation in terms of maximally
correlated states.

  environment</title><description>  We provide a complete characterization of the evolution of entanglement
between two oscillators coupled to a common environment. For initial Gaussian
states we identify three phases with different qualitative long time behavior:
There is a phase where entanglement undergoes a sudden death (SD). Another
phase (SDR) is characterized by an infinite sequence of events of sudden death
and revival of entanglement. In the third phase (NSD) there is no sudden death
of entanglement, which persist for long time. The phase diagram is described
and analytic expressions for the boundary between phases are obtained.
Numerical simulations show the accuracy of the analytic expressions. These
results are applicable to a large variety of non--Markovian environments. The
case of non--resonant oscillators is also numerically investigated.

  II ring</title><description>  We will construct a simple four qubits Hamiltonian of the Rs. molischianum
purple bacteria light harvesting complex II (LH-II) ring which yields energy
levels that carry the ring's oscillator strength. In an excitonic
representation, these levels are associated with the second and the third
lowest electronic excitations of the ring. We will assume that qubits form a
closed loop lattice and the interaction between qubits is only due to the
exchange effect. As we will show, eigenstates are constructed in a such way
that as we subsequently divide qubits of the Rs. molischianum LH-II ring into
the subsystem A consisting of only one qubit and the subsystem B consisting of
the remaining qubits, respective entropies of entanglement increase until the
value of 1 for the maximally entangled state (bipartite system) is reached.
Since the Hamiltonian in essence introduces a two-level approximation for the
LH-II ring, we will go one step further and assume that interactions between
qubits closed loop lattices and an electromagnetic field are described by the
Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian. This assumption is interesting by itself, since it
leads to behavior where the qubits lattice and field oscillate back and fourth
exchanging a quantum of energy, at the Rabbi frequency. This opens a
challenging opportunity to experimentally study the Rs. molischianum LH-II ring
in the regime of cavity QED.

nonlocality. It seems that EPR did mistake in their 1935-paper: if one uses

establishing rigourous bounds on the exact solutions. We have in mind either
bounds on parametric amplification and the related quantum phenomenon of

solution for the appropriate second-order linear ODE in terms of a time-ordered
exponential of 2x2 matrices, then relating the Bogoliubov coefficients to
certain invariants of this matrix. By bounding the matrix in an appropriate
manner, we can thereby bound the Bogoliubov coefficients.

study of entanglement properties of many-body systems has added a new angle to
the study of quantum phase transitions of discrete and continuous degrees of

that are the basis of fair settleable bets. However, in quantum mechanics there
are sets of alternative histories that can be described but which cannot be the
basis for fair settleable bets. Members of such sets can be assigned extended
probabilities that are sometimes negative. A prescription for extended
probabilities is introduced that assigns extended probabilities to all
histories that can be described, fine grained or coarse grained, members of
decoherent sets or not. All probability sum rules are satisfied exactly. Sets
of histories that are recorded to sufficient precision are the basis of

The Schmidt number K is found for both short and long pump pulses and

postulates can be derived by assuming that measurements are discrete
interactions: that is, that we measure at specific moments in time (as opposed
to a continuous measurement that spans a long time interval) and that the
system is in general affected by our measurement. We believe that this way of
presenting quantum mechanics would make it easier to understand by laying out a
more cohesive view of the theory and making it resonate more with our physics
intuition.

way of constructing good non-binary quantum codes, both additive and
nonadditive, for systems with integer dimensions. With the help of computer
search, which results in many interesting codes including some nonadditive
codes meeting the Singleton bounds, we are able to construct explicitly four
families of optimal codes, namely, $[[6,2,3]]_p$, $[[7,3,3]]_p$, $[[8,2,4]]_p$
and $[[8,4,3]]_p$ for any odd dimension $p$ and a family of nonadditive code
$((5,p,3))_p$ for arbitrary $p&gt;3$. In the case of composite numbers as
dimensions, we also construct a family of stabilizer codes $((6,2\cdot
p^2,3))_{2p}$ for odd $p$, whose coding subspace is {\em not} of a dimension
that is a power of the dimension of the physical subsystem.

of classical bits and qubits. Our goal is to provide a framework for designing
codes that approach the ``grandfather'' capacity of an entanglement-assisted
quantum channel for sending classical and quantum information simultaneously.
Our method incorporates several resources for quantum redundancy: fresh ancilla
qubits, entangled bits, and gauge qubits. The use of these diverse resources
gives our technique the benefits of both active and passive quantum error
correction. We can encode a classical-quantum bit stream with periodic quantum
gates because our codes possess a convolutional structure. We end with an
example of a ``grandfather'' quantum convolutional code that protects one qubit
and one classical bit per frame by encoding them with one fresh ancilla qubit,
one entangled bit, and one gauge qubit per frame. We explicitly provide the
encoding and decoding circuits for this example.

  Inequality</title><description>  Determining the ultimate classical information carrying capacity of
electromagnetic waves requires quantum-mechanical analysis to properly account
for the bosonic nature of these waves. Recent work has established capacity
theorems for bosonic single-user and broadcast channels, under the presumption
of two minimum output entropy conjectures. Despite considerable accumulated
evidence that supports the validity of these conjectures, they have yet to be
proven. In this paper, it is shown that the second conjecture suffices to prove
the classical capacity of the bosonic wiretap channel, which in turn would also
prove the quantum capacity of the lossy bosonic channel. The preceding minimum
output entropy conjectures are then shown to be simple consequences of an
Entropy Photon-Number Inequality (EPnI), which is a conjectured
quantum-mechanical analog of the Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) form classical
information theory.

spatial geometry and matter. The states of the system correspond to dynamical
graphs on N vertices. At high energy, the graph describing the system is highly
connected and the physics is invariant under the full symmetric group acting on
the vertices. We present evidence that the model also has a low-energy phase in
which the graph describing the system breaks permutation symmetry and appears
to be ordered, low-dimensional and local. Consideration of the free energy
associated with the dominant terms in the dynamics shows that this low-energy
state is thermodynamically stable under local perturbations. The model can also
give rise to an emergent U(1) gauge theory in the ground state by the
string-net condensation mechanism of Levin and Wen. We also reformulate the
model in graph-theoretic terms and compare its dynamics to some common graph
processes.

  hyperfine-induced decoherence in a quantum dot</title><description>  The coherence time of an electron spin decohered by the nuclear spin
environment in a quantum dot can be substantially increased by subjecting the
electron to suitable dynamical decoupling sequences. We analyze the performance
of high-level decoupling protocols by using a combination of analytical and
exact numerical methods, and by paying special attention to the regimes of
large inter-pulse delays and long-time dynamics, which are outside the reach of
standard average Hamiltonian theory descriptions. We demonstrate that dynamical
decoupling can remain efficient far beyond its formal domain of applicability,
and find that a protocol exploiting concatenated design provides best
performance for this system in the relevant parameter range. In situations
where the initial electron state is known, protocols able to completely freeze
decoherence at long times are constructed and characterized. The impact of
system and control non-idealities is also assessed, including the effect of
intra-bath dipolar interaction, magnetic field bias and bath polarization, as
well as systematic pulse imperfections. While small bias field and small bath
polarization degrade the decoupling fidelity, enhanced performance and temporal
modulation result from strong applied fields and high polarizations. Overall,
we find that if the relative errors of the control parameters do not exceed 5%,
decoupling protocols can still prolong the coherence time by up to two orders
of magnitude.

We compare from this perspective the classical and quantum formalisms and argue
that there is an important difference between them, that suggests that the

with the square of the constraint operator. This provides a bridge between the
standard Dirac procedure --through its geometric implementation-- and the

of the maxima as time increases. We have obtained an allowed-error law for the

(N being the size of the data set). As the power of N is almost one, we
consider the Grover algorithm as robust to a certain extent against
decoherence. This law also provides an absolute threshold: if the free
evolution error is greater than 0.043, Grover algorithm does not work for any

we measured ellipsometrically the optical responses of Au films in a wide range
of wavelengths from 0.14 mum to 33 mum. The films at various thickness were
deposited at different conditions on silicon or mica substrates. Considerable
variation of the frequency dependent dielectric function from sample to sample

the Kramers-Kronig consistency, and extract the Drude parameters of the films.
It was found that the plasma frequency varies in the range from 6.8 eV to 8.4
eV. It is suggested that this variation is related with the film density. X-ray
reflectivity measurements support qualitatively this conclusion. The Casimir
force is evaluated for the dielectric functions corresponding to our samples,

for our films was found to be 5-14% smaller at a distance of 100 nm between the

  with random collisions</title><description>  The dynamics of a single qubit interacting by a sequence of pairwise
collisions with an environment consisting of just two more qubits is analyzed.
Each collision is modeled in terms of a random unitary operator with a uniform
probability distribution described by the uniform Haar measure. We show that
the purity of the system qubit as well as the bipartite and the tripartite
entanglement reach time averaged equilibrium values characterized by large
instantaneous fluctuations.These equilibrium values are independent of the
order of collision among the qubits. The relaxation to equilibrium is analyzed
also in terms of an ensemble average of random collision histories. Such
average allows for a quantitative evaluation and interpretation of the decay
constants. Furthermore a dependence of the transient dynamics on the initial
degree of entanglement between the environment qubits is shown to exist.
Finally the statistical properties of bipartite and tripartite entanglement are
analyzed.

they are prepared for two-party quantum teleportation through noisy channel? We
address this issue by solving analytically a master equation in the Lindbald
form with introducing the noisy channels which makes the quantum channels to be
mixed states. It is found that the answer of the question is dependent on the
type of the noisy channel. If, for example, the noisy channel is ($L_{2,x}$,
$L_{3,x}$, $L_{4,x}$)-type where $L's$ denote the Lindbald operators, GHZ state
is always more robust than W state, i.e. GHZ state preserves more quantum
information. In, however, ($L_{2,y}$, $L_{3,y}$, $L_{4,y}$)-type channel the
situation becomes completely reversed. In ($L_{2,z}$, $L_{3,z}$,
$L_{4,z}$)-type channel W state is more robust than GHZ state when the noisy
paramter ($\kappa$) is comparatively small while GHZ state becomes more robust
when $\kappa$ is large. In isotropic noisy channel we found that both states
preserve equal amount of quantum information. A relation between the average
fidelity and entanglement for the mixed state quantum channels are discussed.

  Majority</title><description>  Secret sharing and multiparty computation (also called &quot;secure function
evaluation&quot;) are fundamental primitives in modern cryptography, allowing a
group of mutually distrustful players to perform correct, distributed
computations under the sole assumption that some number of them will follow the
protocol honestly. This paper investigates how much trust is necessary -- that
is, how many players must remain honest -- in order for distributed quantum
computations to be possible.
  We present a verifiable quantum secret sharing (VQSS) protocol, and a general
secure multiparty quantum computation (MPQC) protocol, which can tolerate any
(n-1)/2 (rounded down) cheaters among n players. Previous protocols for these
tasks tolerated (n-1)/4 (rounded down) and (n-1)/6 (rounded down) cheaters,
respectively. The threshold we achieve is tight - even in the classical case,
``fair'' multiparty computation is not possible if any set of n/2 players can
cheat.
  Our protocols rely on approximate quantum error-correcting codes, which can
tolerate a larger fraction of errors than traditional, exact codes. We
introduce new families of authentication schemes and approximate codes tailored
to the needs of our protocols, as well as new state purification techniques
along the lines of those used in fault-tolerant quantum circuits.

terms of a probability density function $\mathcal{P}_{\rho}(\mathcal{E})$.
There is a need for such a measure since the prevalent measures (such as
\textit{concurrence} and \textit{negativity}) for two qubit systems are rough
benchmarks, and not monotones of each other. Focussing on the two qubit states,
we provide an explicit construction of $\mathcal{P}_{\rho}(\mathcal{E})$ and
show that it is characterised by a set of parameters, of which concurrence is
but one particular combination. $\mathcal{P}_{\rho}(\mathcal{E})$ is manifestly
invariant under $SU(2) \times SU(2)$ transformations. It can, in fact,
reconstruct the state up to local operations - with the specification of at
most four additional parameters. Finally the new measure resolves the
controversy regarding the role of entanglement in quantum computation in NMR

passage, significant fluctuations in the intensity or frequency of the laser
pulse can be tolerated, and the technique performs well even on the border of

only a single laser pulse is required, heating effects arising under realistic

entanglement of a Heisenberg XYZ two-qubit system in the presence of an
inhomogeneous magnetic field is investigated. For a certain value of spin-orbit
parameter $D$, the ground state entanglement tends to vanish suddenly and when
$D$ crosses its critical value $D_c$, the entanglement undergoes a revival. The
maximum value of the entanglement occurs in the revival region. In finite
temperatures there are revival regions in $D-T$ plane. In these regions,
entanglement first increases with increasing temperature and then decreases and
ultimately vanishes for temperatures above a critical value. This critical
temperature is an increasing function of $D$, thus the nonzero entanglement can
exist for larger temperatures. In addition, the amount of entanglement in the
revival region depends on the spin-orbit parameter. Also, the entanglement
teleportation via the quantum channel constructed by the above system is
investigated and finally the influence of the spin-orbit interaction on the
fidelity of teleportation and entanglement of replica state is studied.

proportional to a spin-1/2 operator. The potential is produced by a relatively
simple laser configuration for atoms with a tripod level scheme. We show that
the atomic motion is described by two different dispersion branches with
positive or negative chirality. As a consequence of that, atom reflection shows
unusual features, since an incident wave may split into two reflected ones at a

Remarkably, the latter wave can exhibit negative reflection and may become
evanescent if the angle of incidence exceeds a critical value. These reflection
properties are crucial for future designs in non-Abelian atom optics.

believed to give an exponential speedup as compared to classical ones. While
ground states of one-dimensional systems can be efficiently approximated using
Matrix Product States (MPS), their time evolution can encode quantum
computations, so that simulating the latter should be hard classically.
However, one might believe that for systems with high enough symmetry, and thus
insufficient parameters to encode a quantum computation, efficient classical
simulation is possible. We discuss supporting evidence to the contrary: We
provide a rigorous proof of the observation that a time independent local
Hamiltonian can yield a linear increase of the entropy when acting on a product
state in a translational invariant framework. This criterion has to be met by
any classical simulation method, which in particular implies that every global
approximation of the evolution requires exponential resources for any MPS based
method.

of a spin-1/2 particle or light polarization. Analogous objects are derived for
unitary groups larger than SU(2) through an iterative procedure that constructs
evolution operators for higher-dimensional SU in terms of lower-dimensional
ones. We focus, in particular, on the SU(4) of two qubits which describes all
possible logic gates in quantum computation. For a general Hamiltonian of SU(4)
with 15 parameters, and for Hamiltonians of its various sub-groups so that
fewer parameters suffice, we derive Bloch-like rotation of unit vectors
analogous to the one familiar for a single spin in a magnetic field. The
unitary evolution of a quantal spin pair is thereby expressed as rotations of
real vectors. Correspondingly, the manifolds involved are Bloch two-spheres
along with higher dimensional manifolds such as a four-sphere for the SO(5)
sub-group and an eight-dimensional Grassmannian manifold for the general SU(4).
This latter may also be viewed as two, mutually orthogonal, real

computer resources required. This modification is based on a principle of
&quot;observing&quot; the system outside the light-cone. We apply this method to study
spin relaxation in systems started out of equilibrium with initial conditions
that give rise to very rapid entanglement growth. We also show that it is
possible to approximate time evolution under a local Hamiltonian by a quantum

Asymptotically, these modified methods allow a doubling of the system size that
one can obtain compared to direct simulation. We then consider a different
problem of thermal properties of disordered spin chains and use quantum belief
propagation to average over different configurations. We test this algorithm on
one dimensional systems with mixed ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic bonds,
where we can compare to quantum Monte Carlo, and then we apply it to the study

correlations between distant events that are nonlocal in the sense of violating

science and the discovery of the power of nonlocal correlations, e.g. for
cryptographic key distribution beyond the standard Quantum Key Distribution
schemes, strengthen Bell's wish and make it even more timely.
  In 2003, Leggett proposed an alternative model for nonlocal correlations
[Found. Phys. 33, 1469 (2003)], that he proved to be incompatible with quantum
predictions. We present here a new approach to this model, along with new
inequalities for testing it. Remarkably these inequalities can be derived in a
very simple way, assuming only the non-negativity of probability distributions;
they are also stronger than previously published Leggett-type inequalities. The
simplest of these inequalities is experimentally violated. Then we go beyond
Leggett's model, and show that one cannot ascribe even partially defined
individual properties to the components of a maximally entangled pair.

the magnetic field. In such a case the electron moving in the magnetic field
produces so called synchrotron radiation. In other words the photons are
emitted from the points of the electron trajectory and it means that the
trajectory of electron is visible in the synchrotron radiation spectrum. The
axiomatic system of quantum mechanics does not enable to define the trajectory
of the elementary particle. The two-slit experiment and AB experiment in a
magnetic field was never performed and it means that they are the missing
experiments of quantum mechanics. The extension of the discussion to the
cosmical rays moving in the magnetic field of the Saturn magnetosphere and its
rings is mentioned. It is related to the probe CASSINI. The solution of the
problem in the framework of the hydrodynamical model of quantum mechanics and
the nonlinear quantum mechanics is also mentioned.

often constructed with the help of its stabilizer formalism. But there have
been many known examples of nonadditive codes which are beyond the standard
quantum error correction theory using the stabilizer formalism. In this paper,
we suggest the other type of Hamiltonian formalism for quantum error correction
code without involving the stabilizer formalism, and explain it by studying the
Shor nine-qubit code and its generalization. In this Hamiltonian formulation,
the unitary evolution operator at a specific time is a unitary basis
transformation matrix from the product basis to the quantum error correction
code. This basis transformation matrix acts as an entangling quantum operator
transforming a separate state to an entangled one, and hence the entanglement
nature of the quantum error correction code can be explicitly shown up.
Furthermore, as it forms a unitary representation of the Artin braid group, the
quantum error correction code can be described by a braiding operator.
Moreover, as the unitary evolution operator is a solution of the quantum
Yang--Baxter equation, the corresponding Hamiltonian model can be explained as
an integrable model in the Yang--Baxter theory. On the other hand, we
generalize the Shor nine-qubit code and articulate a topic called quantum error
correction codes using Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states to yield new
nonadditive codes and channel-adapted codes.

this paper the principal features of the reservoir structure remain constant in

sufficiently fast it is possible to inhibit, or dramatically enhance the decay

it is possible to extract energy from a cavity-atom system faster than the
empty cavity rate. Similar, but less dramatic effects are possible for moderate

The special case of two OPOs is studied, as it is shown that the resulting five

but not to his magnetic monopole theory, except for his relation between
electric and magnetic charge. The theory is based on the fact, that the
massless Dirac equation admits a second electromagnetic coupling, deduced from
a pseudo-scalar gauge invariance. The equation thus obtained has the symmetry
laws of a massless leptonic, magnetic monopole, able to interact weakly. We
give a more precise form of the Dirac relation between electric and magnetic
charges and a quantum form of the Poincare first integral. In the Weyl
representation our equation splits into P-conjugated monopole and antimonopole
equations with the correct electromagnetic coupling and opposite chiralities,
predicted by P. Curie. Charge-conjugated monopoles are symmetric in space and
not in time (contrary to the electric particles), an important fact for the
vacuum polarization. Our monopoles are magnetically excited neutrinos, which
leads to experimental consequences. These monopoles are assumed to be produced
by electromagnetic pulses or arcs, leading to nuclear transmutations and, for
beta radioactive elements, a shortening of the life time and the emission of
monopoles instead of neutrinos in a magnetic field. A corresponding discussion

  nonzero temperature</title><description>  It is well known since a long time that all lossy conductors at finite
temperature display an electronic noise, the Johnson-Nyquist noise, arising
from the thermal agitation of electric charges inside the conductor. The
existence of this noise implies that two nearby discharged conductors at finite
temperature should repel each other, as a result of the electrodynamic
interaction between the Johnson-Nyquist currents in either conductor and the
eddy currents they induce in the other. It is suggested that this force is at
the origin of the recently discovered large repulsive correction to the thermal
Casimir force between two lossy metallic plates. Further support for this
physical picture is obtained by studying a simple system of two linear noisy
antennas. Using elementary concepts from circuit theory, we show that the
repulsive force engendered by the Johnson-Nyquist noise results in the same
kind of thermodynamic inconsistencies found in the Casimir problem. We show
that all inconsistencies are however resolved if account is taken of capacitive
effects associated with the end points of the antennas. Our findings therefore
suggest that capacitive effects resulting from the finite size of the plates,
may be essential for a resolution of the analogous problems met in the thermal
Casimir effect.

enhancing the efficiency of the quantum search. Recently Li and Li found that a
particular form of phase matching yields, with a single Grover operation, a
success probability greater than 25/27 for finding the equal-amplitude
superposition of marked states when the fraction of the marked states stored in
a database state is greater than 1/3. Although this single operation eliminates
the oscillations of the success probability that occur with multiple Grover
operations, the latter oscillations reappear with multiple iterations of Li and
Li's phase matching. In this paper we introduce a multi-phase matching subject
to a certain matching rule by which we can obtain a multiple Grover operation
that with only a few iterations yields a success probability that is almost
constant and unity over a wide range of the fraction of marked items. As an
example we show that a multi-phase operation with six iterations yields a
success probability between 99.8% and 100% for a fraction of marked states of
1/10 or larger.

  dynamics</title><description>  The computational cost of exact methods for quantum simulation using
classical computers grows exponentially with system size. As a consequence,
these techniques can only be applied to small systems. By contrast, we
demonstrate that quantum computers could exactly simulate chemical reactions in
polynomial time. Our algorithm uses the split-operator approach and explicitly
simulates all electron-nuclear and inter-electronic interactions in quadratic
time. Surprisingly, this treatment is not only more accurate than the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation, but faster and more efficient as well, for all
reactions with more than about four atoms. This is the case even though the
entire electronic wavefunction is propagated on a grid with appropriately short
timesteps. Although the preparation and measurement of arbitrary states on a
quantum computer is inefficient, here we demonstrate how to prepare states of
chemical interest efficiently. We also show how to efficiently obtain
chemically relevant observables, such as state-to-state transition
probabilities and thermal reaction rates. Quantum computers using these
techniques could outperform current classical computers with one hundred
qubits.

graph $G$ such that every edge of $G$ represents a summation (contraction) over
a matching pair of indexes. It was shown recently by Valiant, Cai, and
Choudhary that tensor networks can be efficiently contracted on planar graphs
if components of every tensor obey a system of quadratic equations known as
matchgate identities. Such tensors are referred to as matchgate tensors. The
present paper provides an alternative approach to contraction of matchgate
tensor networks that easily extends to non-planar graphs. Specifically, it is
shown that a matchgate tensor network on a graph $G$ of genus $g$ with $n$
vertices can be contracted in time $T=poly(n) + 2^{2g} O(m^3)$ where $m$ is the
minimum number of edges one has to remove from $G$ in order to make it planar.
Our approach makes use of anticommuting (Grassmann) variables and Gaussian
integrals.

The mean-field approximation of the deduced model is described. Compared to the

revivals of the atomic population dynamics are absent for the experimentally

of foaminess is found to be consistent with holography, a principle prefigured
in the physics of black hole entropy. It has bearing on the ultimate accuracies
of clocks and measurements and the physics of quantum computation. Consistent
with existing archived data on active galactic nuclei from the Hubble Space
Telescope, the application of the holographic spacetime foam model to cosmology
requires the existence of dark energy which, we argue, is composed of an
enormous number of inert &quot;particles&quot; of extremely long wavelength. We suggest
that these &quot;particles&quot; obey infinite statistics in which all representations of
the particle permutation group can occur, and that the nonlocality present in
systems obeying infinite statistics may be related to the nonlocality present
in holographic theories. We also propose to detect spacetime foam by looking
for halos in the images of distant quasars, and argue that it does not modify
the GZK cutoff in the ultra-high energy cosmic ray spectrum and its
contributions to time-of-flight differences of high energy gamma rays from
distant GRB are too small to be detectable.

thermodynamic equilibrium in the presence of dissipation. The resulting
boundary conditions allow a conventional quantum mechanical treatment of the
radiation within the cavity from which we obtain the contribution of the cavity
walls to the density of states, and from it, the thermodynamic properties of
the system. The contribution of the cavity to the energy diverges as it
incorporates the interaction energy between neighbor atoms in a continuum

determined non--destructively by measuring the phase shift of an off--resonant
probe beam, caused by the state dependent index of refraction of the atoms. The
dispersive light--atom interaction, however, gives rise to a differential light
shift (AC Stark shift) between the atomic states which, for a nonuniform probe
intensity distribution, causes an inhomogeneous dephasing between the atoms. In
this paper, we investigate the effects of this inhomogeneous light shift in
non--destructive measurement schemes. We interpret our experimental data on
dispersively probed Rabi oscillations and Ramsey fringes in terms of a simple
light shift model which is shown to describe the observed behavior well.
Furthermore, we show that by using spin echo techniques, the inhomogeneous
phase shift distribution between the two clock levels can be reversed.

  polarization mode dispersion</title><description>  We investigate the quantum decoherence of frequency and polarization
variables of photons via polarization mode dispersion in optical fibers. By
observing the analogy between the propagation equation of the field and the
Schr\&quot;odinger equation, we develop a master equation under Markovian
approximation and analytically solve for the field density matrix. We identify
distinct decay behaviors for the polarization and frequency variables for
single-photon and two-photon states. For the single photon case, purity
functions indicate that complete decoherence for each variable is possible only
for infinite fiber length. For entangled two-photon states passing through
separate fibers, entanglement associated with each variable can be completely
destroyed after characteristic finite propagation distances. In particular, we
show that frequency disentanglement is independent of the initial polarization
status. For propagation of two photons in a common fiber, the evolution of a
polarization singlet state is addressed. We show that while complete
polarization disentanglement occurs at a finite propagation distance, frequency
entanglement could survive at any finite distance for gaussian states.

  Fields</title><description>  Quantum stabilizer states over GF(m) can be represented as self-dual additive
codes over GF(m^2). These codes can be represented as weighted graphs, and
orbits of graphs under the generalized local complementation operation
correspond to equivalence classes of codes. We have previously used this fact
to classify self-dual additive codes over GF(4). In this paper we classify
self-dual additive codes over GF(9), GF(16), and GF(25). Assuming that the
classical MDS conjecture holds, we are able to classify all self-dual additive
MDS codes over GF(9) by using an extension technique. We prove that the minimum
distance of a self-dual additive code is related to the minimum vertex degree
in the associated graph orbit. Circulant graph codes are introduced, and a
computer search reveals that this set contains many strong codes. We show that
some of these codes have highly regular graph representations.

quantum and classical mechanics. First, by studying the exact dynamics of
harmonic systems in the presence of an arbitrary radiation field, it is
demonstrated that anharmonicities in the system's potential are a necessary
requirement for phase controllability. Then, by analyzing the space-time
symmetries of the laser-driven Liouville dynamics for classical and quantum
systems, a common set of temporal symmetries for the driving field that need to
be violated to induce transport are identified. The conditions apply to
continuous wave lasers and to symmetry breaking effects that do not rely on the
control of the absolute phase of the field. Known examples of laser fields that
can induce transport in symmetric systems are seen to be particular cases of
these symmetry constraints.

claimed recently that a very large electron mass shift should be expected near
the surface of a metal hydride [{\it Eur. Phys. J. C}, {\bf 46} 107 (2006)]. We
examine the shift using a formulation based on the Coulomb gauge, which leads
to a much smaller shift. The maximization of the electron mass shift under
nonequilibrium conditions seems nonetheless to be an interesting problem. We
consider a scheme in which a current in a hollow wire produces a large vector
potential in the wire center. Fluctuations in an LC circuit with nearly matched
loss and gain can produce large current fluctuations; and these can increase
the electron mass shift by orders of magnitude over its room temperature value.

electromagnetic field is suggested where above fields are considered as
propagating regions of the space itself with distorted euclidean geometry. It
is shown that equations for these fields can be considered as relations
describing the space topological defects. These defects, being closed
topological manifolds, are embedded in the outer five-dimensional space, and
observable objects appear to be intersections of above defects with the
physical space. This interpretation explains irrational properties of quantum
objects such as wave-corpuscular duality, stochastic behavior, instantaneous
nonlocal correlation in EPR-paradox, the light velocity invariance and so on.
Wave-corpuscular properties arise as a result of the defect periodical movement
in the outer space relative to its intersection with the physical space, and
just this periodical movement attributes phase to the propagating object.
Appearance of probabilities within the formalism is a consequence of
uncertainty of the closed topological manifold shape, and ensemble of all
possible shapes for the same object can be considered as an ensemble of hidden
variables that leads to probabilistic description. Embedded in the outer space
topological defects provide channels for nonlocal correlations between their
intersections-- noninteracting particles in EPR-experiments, and this means
that the proposed approach can be considered as a nonlocal model with hidden
variables.

  Nevertheless, it is remarkable that this deceptively simple formulation

matrix (to obtain a Kraus-type representation). Conversely, for a given
time-dependent linear map, a necessary and sufficient condition is given for
the existence of a corresponding master equation, where the (not necessarily
unique) form of this equation is explicitly determined. It is shown that a
`best possible' master equation may always be defined, for approximating the
evolution in the case that no exact master equation exists. Examples involving

(CTQWs) on Erdos-Renyi networks. The Erdos-Renyi network of N nodes is
constructed by connecting every pair of nodes with probability $p$. We
numerically calculate the ensemble averaged transition probability of quantum
transport between two nodes of the networks. For finite networks, we find that
the limiting transition probability is reached very quickly. For infinite
networks whose spectral density follows the semicircle law, the efficiencies of
the classical and quantum-mechanical transport are compared on networks of
different average degree. In the long time limiting, we consider the
distribution of the ensemble averaged transition probabilities, and show that
there is a high probability to find the exciton at the initial node. Such high
return probability almost do not alter in a wide range of connection
probability p but increases rapidly when the network approaches to be fully
connected. For networks whose topology is not extremely connected, the return
probability is inversely proportional to the network size N. Furthermore, the
transport dynamics are compared with that on a random graph model in which the
degree of each node equals to the average degree of the Erdos-Renyi networks.

state of minimum energy due to the assumption that the Pauli Exclusion
Principle prevents the decay of positive energy electrons into occupied
negative energy states. However recently papers have appeared that claim to
show that there exist states with less energy than that of the vacuum[4][5][6].
Here we will consider a simple model of HT consisting of zero mass electrons in
1-1D space-time. It will be shown that for this model there are states with
less energy than the HT vacuum state and that the Pauli Principle is obeyed.
Therefore the conjecture that the Pauli Principle prevents the existence of
states with less energy than the vacuum state is not correct.

one-dimension ring lattice of N nodes in which every node is connected to its
2m nearest neighbors (m on either side). In the framework of the Bloch function
ansatz, we calculate the spacetime transition probabilities between two nodes
of the lattice. We find that the transport of CTQWs between two different nodes
is faster than that of the classical continuous-time random walk (CTRWs). The
transport speed, which is defined by the ratio of the shortest path length and
propagating time, increases with the connectivity parameter m for both the
CTQWs and CTRWs. For fixed parameter m, the transport of CTRWs gets slow with
the increase of the shortest distance while the transport (speed) of CTQWs
turns out to be a constant value. In the long time limit, depending on the
network size N and connectivity parameter m, the limiting probability
distributions of CTQWs show various paterns. When the network size N is an even
number, the probability of being at the original node differs from that of
being at the opposite node, which also depends on the precise value of
parameter m.

counterpart and plays a decisive role in quantum information theory. Several
protocols, like the teleportation, are based on quantum entangled states.
Moreover, any quantum algorithm which does not create entanglement can be
efficiently simulated on a classical computer. The exact role of the
entanglement is nevertheless not well understood. Since an exact analysis of
entanglement evolution induces an exponential slowdown, we consider
approximative analysis based on the framework of abstract interpretation. In
this paper, a concrete quantum semantics based on superoperators is associated
with a simple quantum programming language. The representation of entanglement,
i.e. the design of the abstract domain is a key issue. A representation of
entanglement as a partition of the memory is chosen. An abstract semantics is
introduced, and the soundness of the approximation is proven.

on bipartite systems that preserve positivity of partial transpose (PPT

transformations by PPT operations. Restricting our attention to the case where
we start with a rank K maximally entangled state, we give a necessary condition

Mathematically, the two-graph state can be viewed as a simultaneous

four-level atomic system in a closed (diamond) type configuration. A
femtosecond frequency comb is used to establish phase coherence between a pair
of two-photon transitions in cold Rb atoms. By controlling the spectral phase
of the frequency comb we demonstrate the optical phase sensitive response of
the diamond system. The high-resolution state selectivity of the comb is used
to demonstrate the importance of the signs of dipole moment matrix elements in
this type of closed-loop excitation. Finally, the pulse shape is optimized
resulting in a 256% increase in the two-photon transition rate by forcing
constructive interference between the mode pairs detuned from an intermediate

the van der Waals potential between two neutral, unpolarized, ground-state
atoms in the presence of a homogeneous, dispersing and absorbing
magnetoelectric sphere is studied. When the radius of the sphere becomes
sufficiently large, the result asymptotically agrees with that for two atoms
near a planar interface. In the opposite limit of a very small sphere, the
sphere can effectively be regarded as being a third ground-state atom, and the
nonadditive three-atom van der Waals potential is recovered. To illustrate the
effect of a sphere of arbitrary radius, numerical results are presented for the
triangular arrangement where the atoms are at equidistance from the sphere, and
for the linear arrangement where the atoms and the sphere are aligned along a
straight line. As demonstrated, the enhancement or reduction of the interaction
potential in the presence of purely electric or magnetic spheres can be
physically understood in terms of image charges.

machines. When applied to computations in non-deterministic Turing machines,
this method may produce contradictory (and therefore trivial) theories,
considering classical logic as the underlying logic. By substituting in such
theories the underlying logic by a paraconsistent logic we define a new
computation model, the paraconsistent Turing machine. This model allows a
partial simulation of superposed states of quantum computing. Such a feature
allows the definition of paraconsistent algorithms which solve (with some
restrictions) the well-known Deutsch's and Deutsch-Jozsa problems. This first
model of computation, however, does not adequately represent the notions of
entangled states and relative phase, which are key features in quantum
computing. In this way, a more sharpened model of paraconsistent Turing
machines is defined, which better approaches quantum computing features.
Finally, we define complexity classes for such models, and establish some
relationships with classical complexity classes.

our recent work (arXiv:0704.3723), in which the Dyson indices of random matrix
theory played an essential role, to include the use of not only the volume
element of the Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) metric, but also that of the Bures (minimal
monotone) metric as measures over these finite-dimensional quantum systems.
Further, we now employ the Euler-angle parameterization of density matrices
(rho), in addition to the Bloore parameterization. The Euler-angle separability
function for the minimally degenerate complex two-qubit states is well-fitted
by the sixth-power of the participation ratio, R(rho)=1/Tr(rho)^2.
Additionally, replacing R(rho) by a simple linear transformation of the
Verstraete-Audenaert-De Moor function (arXiv:quant-oh/0011111), we find close
adherence to Dyson-index behavior for the real and complex (nondegenerate)
two-qubit scenarios. Several of the analyses reported help to fortify our
conjectures that the HS and Bures separability probabilities of the complex
two-qubit states are 8/33 = 0.242424 and 1680 (sqrt{2}-1)/pi^8 = 0.733389,
respectively. Employing certain regularized beta functions in the role of
Euler-angle separability functions, we closely reproduce--consistently with the
Dyson-index ansatz--several HS two-qubit separability probability conjectures.

  We introduce an integral representation of separable forms. In particular, we

integrable map $\Phi:\C^n\to \C^m$, with square integrable conjugate derivative
$D_{z^*}\Phi$, is a separable form. Vice versa, any separable form in the

It turns out that this approach provides a well defined selection rule to give

  in the Husimi Representation</title><description>  In a previous work the concept of quantum potential is generalized into
extended phase space (EPS) for a particle in linear and harmonic potentials. It
was shown there that in contrast to the Schr\&quot;odinger quantum mechanics by an
appropriate extended canonical transformation one can obtain the Wigner
representation of phase space quantum mechanics in which the quantum potential
is removed from dynamical equation. In other words, one still has the form
invariance of the ordinary Hamilton-Jacobi equation in this representation. The
situation, mathematically, is similar to the disappearance of the centrifugal
potential in going from the spherical to the Cartesian coordinates. Here we
show that the Husimi representation is another possible representation where
the quantum potential for the harmonic potential disappears and the modified
Hamilton-Jacobi equation reduces to the familiar classical form. This happens
when the parameter in the Husimi transformation assumes a specific value
corresponding to $Q$-function.

existence of quantum mechanically incompatible quantities. We first recall
several contradictions arising between the assumption of a joint distribution

irrespective of the issue of locality. Then, we try to disentangle the locality

accounting for the EPR correlations but denying the existence of joint

order to formalize this mechanism we introduce the idea that the information

terms of observables of the initial system. We use this approach to show that
information which is broadcast into many parts of the environment can be
encoded in a single observable. This supports a model of decoherence where the
pointer observable can be an arbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM).
This generalization makes it possible to characterize the emergence of a
realistic classical phase-space. In addition, this model clarifies the
relationships among the information preserved in the system, the information
flowing from the system to the environment (measurement), and the establishment
of correlations between the system and the environment.

The smearing technique has two immediate applications. It permits simplifying
the system of Kramers-Moyal equations for smeared and unsmeared conditional

much easier than the initial path integral. Three simple examples are

discussed. In order to assess the applicability of the scheme for distant
entanglement generation between atomic qubits proposed by T.D. Ladd et al. [New
J. Phys. 8, 184 (2006)] to two distant quantum dots, one needs to understand
the limitations imposed by hyperfine interactions of the quantum dot spin with
the nuclear spins of the material and by non-identical quantum dots.
Feasibility is displayed by calculating the fidelity for Bell state generation
analytically within an approximate framework. The fidelity is evaluated for a
wide range of parameters and different pulse lengths, yielding a trade-off
between signal and decoherence, as well as a set of optimal parameters.
Strategies to overcome the effect of non-identical quantum dots on the fidelity
are examined and the timescales imposed by the nuclear spins are discussed,
showing that efficient entanglement generation is possible with distant quantum
dots. In this context, effects due to light hole transitions become important
and have to be included. The scheme is discussed for one- as well as for
two-sided cavities, where one must be careful with reflected light which

a more elaborate semiclassical simulation which includes trion formation.

procedure of atom's excitation. The spectrum of radiation emitted by a
two-level atom excited from the ground state by a pi pulse of the resonant pump
field is calculated for the case when the Rabi frequency is much larger than
the relaxation rate. It is shown that the central part of the spectral
distribution has a standard Lorentzian form, whereas for detunings from the
resonance that are larger than the Rabi frequency the spectral density falls
off faster. The shape of the wings of the spectral line is sensitive to the
form of the pi pulse. The implications for the quantum Zeno effect theory and
for the estimates of the duration of quantum jumps are discussed.

various systems. There have been extensive experimental search for possible
exciton superfluid (ESF) in semiconductor electron-hole bilayer (EHBL) systems
below liquid Helium temperature. However, exciton superfluid are meta-stable
and will eventually decay through emitting photons. Here we study quantum
nature of photons emitted from the excitonic superfluid (ESF) phase in the
semiconductor EHBL and find that the light emitted from the excitonic
superfluid has unique and unusual features not shared by any other atomic or
condensed matter systems. We show that the emitted photons along the direction
perpendicular to the layer are in a coherent state, those along all tilted
directions are in a two modes squeezed state. We determine the two mode
squeezing spectra, the angle resolved power spectrum, the line shapes of both
the momentum distribution curve (MDC) and the energy distribution curve (EDC).
  From the two photon correlation functions, we find there are photon bunching,
the photo-count statistics is super-Poissonian. We discuss how several
important parameters such as the chemical potential, the exciton decay rate,
the quasiparticle energy spectrum and the dipole-dipole interaction strength
between the excitons in our theory can be extracted from the experimental data
and comment on available experimental data on both EDC and MDC.

the STIRAP process in atomic physics. In the linear regime, the system exhibits
an adiabatic power transfer between two waveguides which are not directly

In the presence of nonlinearity the behavior of this configuration is

These states have a special significance for these systems as they describe

the generalization of the two-mode case to an open quantum system. The
phase-space description based on generalized SU(M) coherent states yields a
Liouvillian flow in the macroscopic limit, which can be efficiently simulated

well-known problems where the common mean-field approach fails, like the
description of dynamical instabilities and chaotic dynamics. Moreover, it
provides a valuable tool for a semi-classical approximation of many interesting

tool for controlling the quantum state of a two-level atom. In our model system
the frequency and coupling strength associated with microscopic reservoir modes
are modulated, while the principal features of the reservoir structure remain
fixed in time. Physically, this may be achieved by containing a static
atom-cavity system inside an oscillating external bath. We show that it is
possible to dynamically decouple the atom from its environment, despite the
fact that the two remain resonant at all times. This can lead to Markovian
dynamics, even for a strong atom-bath coupling, as the atomic decay becomes
inhibited into all but a few channels; the reservoir occupation spectrum
consequently acquires a sideband structure, with peaks separated by the
frequency of the environmental modulation. The reduction in the rate of
spontaneous emission using this approach can be significantly greater than
could be achieved with an oscillatory atom-bath detuning using the same
parameters.

wires, which has recently developed into a topic of lively interest. The
principal motivation is in connecting quantum registers without resorting to
optics. A spin chain is a permanently coupled 1D system of spins. When one
places a quantum state on one end of it, the state will be dynamically
transmitted to the other end with some efficiency if the spins are coupled by
an exchange interaction. No external modulations or measurements on the body of
the chain, except perhaps at the very ends, is required for this purpose. For
the simplest (uniformly coupled) chain and the simplest encoding (single qubit
encoding), however, dispersion reduces the quality of transfer. We present a
variety of alternatives proposed by various groups to achieve perfect quantum
state transfer through spin chains. We conclude with a brief discussion of the
various directions in which the topic is developing.

phenomena in quantum systems, where classical probability theory does not
apply, because the lattice of measurable sets is not necessarily distributive.
On the other hand, it is well known that the lattices of concepts, that arise
in data analysis, are in general also non-distributive, albeit for completely
different reasons. In his recent book, van Rijsbergen argues that many of the
logical tools developed for quantum systems are also suitable for applications
in information retrieval. I explore the mathematical support for this idea on
an abstract vector space model, covering several forms of data analysis
(information retrieval, data mining, collaborative filtering, formal concept
analysis...), and roughly based on an idea from categorical quantum mechanics.
It turns out that quantum (i.e., noncommutative) probability distributions
arise already in this rudimentary mathematical framework. We show that a
Bell-type inequality must be satisfied by the standard similarity measures, if
they are used for preference predictions. The fact that already a very general,
abstract version of the vector space model yields simple counterexamples for
such inequalities seems to be an indicator of a genuine need for quantum
statistics in data analysis.

these channels is a pressing open question in quantum information theory. We
give a comprehensive review of what is currently known about the structure of
degradable quantum channels, including a number of new results as well as
alternate proofs of some known results. In the case of qubits, we provide a
complete characterization of all degradable channels with two dimensional
output, give a new proof that a qubit channel with two Kraus operators is
either degradable or anti-degradable and present a complete description of
anti-degradable unital qubit channels with a new proof.
  For higher output dimensions we explore the relationship between the output
and environment dimensions ($d_B$ and $d_E$ respectively) of degradable
channels. For several broad classes of channels we show that they can be
modeled with a environment that is &quot;small&quot; in the sense $d_E \leq d_B$. Perhaps
surprisingly, we also present examples of degradable channels with ``large''
environments, in the sense that the minimal dimension $d_E &gt; d_B$. Indeed, one
can have $d_E &gt; \tfrac{1}{4} d_B^2$.
  In the case of channels with diagonal Kraus operators, we describe the
subclass which are complements of entanglement breaking channels. We also
obtain a number of results for channels in the convex hull of conjugations with
generalized Pauli matrices. However, a number of open questions remain about
these channels and the more general case of random unitary channels.

  Optics</title><description>  In the last few years there has been a lot of interest in quantum repeater
protocols using only atomic ensembles and linear optics. Here we show that the
local generation of high-fidelity entangled pairs of atomic excitations, in
combination with the use of two-photon detections for long-distance
entanglement generation, permits the implementation of a very attractive
quantum repeater protocol. Such a repeater is robust with respect to phase
fluctuations in the transmission channels, and at the same time achieves higher
entanglement generation rates than other protocols using the same ingredients.
We propose an efficient method of generating high-fidelity entangled pairs
locally, based on the partial readout of the ensemble-based memories. We also
discuss the experimental implementation of the proposed protocol.

technology based on the principles of Quantum Information is the influence of
noise which tends to work against the quantum features of such systems. It
becomes then crucial to understand how noise affects the evolution of quantum
circuits: several techniques have been proposed among which stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) can represent a very convenient tool. We show how
SDEs naturally map any Markovian noise into a linear operator, which we will
call a noise gate, acting on the wave function describing the state of the
circuit, and we will discuss some examples. We shall see that these gates can
be manipulated like any standard quantum gate, thus simplifying in certain
circumstances the task of computing the overall effect of the noise at each
stage of the protocol. This approach yields equivalent results to those derived
from the Lindblad equation; yet, as we show, it represents a handy and fast
tool for performing computations, and moreover, it allows for fast numerical
simulations and generalizations to non Markovian noise. In detail we review the
depolarizing channel and the generalized amplitude damping channel in terms of
this noise gate formalism and show how these techniques can be applied to any
quantum circuit.

many working physicists. In particular, interest has come from those involved
in quantum computing and information theory, as there has always been a strong
foundational element in this field. This paper introduces one interpretation of
quantum mechanics, a modern `many-worlds' theory, from the perspective of
quantum computation. Reasons for seeking to interpret quantum mechanics are
discussed, then the specific `neo-Everettian' theory is introduced and its
claim as the best available interpretation defended. The main objections to the
interpretation, including the so-called ``problem of probability'' are shown to
fail. The local nature of the interpretation is demonstrated, and the
implications of this both for the interpretation and for quantum mechanics more
generally are discussed. Finally, the consequences of the theory for quantum
computation are investigated, and common objections to using many worlds to
describe quantum computing are answered. We find that using this particular
many-worlds theory as a physical foundation for quantum computation gives
several distinct advantages over other interpretations, and over not
interpreting quantum theory at all.

conducting plates of large extent with a homogeneous and isotropic medium
between them, we discuss the physical meaning of the electromagnetic field
energy $W_{\rm disp}$ when the intervening medium is weakly dispersive but
nondissipative. The presence of dispersion means that the energy density
contains terms of the form $d[\omega\epsilon(\omega)] /d\omega$ and
$d[\omega\mu(\omega)] /d\omega$. We find that, as $W_{\rm disp}$ refers
thermodynamically to a non-closed physical system, it is {\it not} to be
identified with the internal thermodynamic energy $U$ following from the free
energy $F$, or the electromagnetic energy $W$, when the last-mentioned
quantities are calculated without such dispersive derivatives. To arrive at
this conclusion, we adopt a model in which the system is a capacitor, linked to
an external self-inductance $L$ such that stationary oscillations become
possible. Therewith the model system becomes a non-closed one. As an
introductory step, we review the meaning of the nondispersive energies, $F, U,$
and $W$. As a final topic, we consider an anomaly connected with local surface
divergences encountered in Casimir energy calculations for higher spacetime
dimensions, $D&gt;4$, and discuss briefly its dispersive generalization. This kind
of application is essentially a generalization of the treatment of Alnes {\it

weak+vacuum decoy state protocol, and one-decoy decoy state protocol, with

numerical simulation results show that QKD with an untrusted source gives a key

We construct a similar rotation and apply it to the more complicated model. We

as a resource for quantum computation, and spin squeezing can be used to create

More specifically, we entangle the nuclear and electronic spins of $10^{12}$
Cesium atoms at room temperature. We verify entanglement and ensemble spin

same eigenvalues is described. The eigenvalue problem for the first Hamiltonian
$\hat{H}_n$ of the pair must be posed in the complex domain, so its
eigenfunctions satisfy a complex differential equation and fulfill homogeneous
boundary conditions in Stokes' wedges in the complex plane. The eigenfunctions
of the second Hamiltonian $\hat{K}_n$ of the pair obey a real differential
equation and satisfy boundary conditions on the real axis. This equivalence
constitutes a proof that the eigenvalues of both Hamiltonians are real.
Although the eigenvalue differential equation associated with $\hat{K}_n$ is

explored in the literature in two main ways: firstly in a variety of explicit
models of quantum systems, and secondly at a conceptual level. This note
introduces a third approach, intended to complement the other two. It describes
a simple toy model, which, under a natural interpretation, shows how
retrocausality can emerge from simple global constraints. The model is also
useful in permitting a clear distinction between the kind of retrocausality
likely to be of interest in QM, and a different kind of reverse causality, with
which it is liable to be confused. The model is proposed in the hope that
future elaborations might throw light on the potential of retrocausality to
account for quantum phenomena.

The universality of G_{u} is established by showing that it can construct the

Sweep parameter values are provided which simulations indicate will produce the
different gates in G_{u}, and for which the gate error probability P_{e}

non-composite and generate controllable quantum interference effects that allow
the gates in G_{u} to operate non-adiabatically while maintaining high

previously been shown how these rapid passage sweeps can be applied to atomic
systems using electric fields. Here we show how these sweeps can be applied to
both superconducting charge and flux qubit systems. The simulations suggest

Corrections produced by the counter- rotating terms appear in the first order

is moving on a graph, computational primitives (unitary operators associated
with the edges) are applied to ancillary qubits (the register). The model with
one walker was originally proposed by R. Feynman, who thus anticipated many
features of the Continuous Time Quantum Walk (CTWQ) computing paradigm. In this
note we examine the behaviour of an interacting CTQW with two walkers and
examine the interaction of the walkers with noncommuting primitives. We endow
such a walk with a notion of trajectory, in the sense of sample path of an
associated Markov process, in order to use such notions as sojourn time and
first passage time as heuristic tools for gaining intuition about its
behaviour.

c) is a consistent approach to quantum mechanics very closely related to
classical physics. Several postulates are formulated that are satisfied in
classical physics, general relativity theory, quantum theory and
thermodynamics. In this interpretation, particles are always particles, never
waves, and many paradoxes can be easily understood or avoided. In particular,
the postulates allow to explain the measurement problem and the concept of
interaction-free measurements; the latter allows to find objects without
``touching'' them, and sometimes the phrase ``seeing in the dark'' is used.
Additionally, the concepts of complementarity, uncertainty, decoherence,
locality and realism are investigated. One key property of this interpretation
is that all observed probabilities and interference patterns are known before a
particle is in the experiment. Ontological questions are discussed.

they are their iterated versions (equation 20). Consequently, it is proved that
Q is contained in a hyperbolic cube whose axes lie along the non-local

The lattice provides a structured continuum allowing for the existence of bound
dimer states both below and above the continuum bands, with pairs above the
continuum stabilized by either repulsive interactions or their center of mass
motion. Inside the band the Feshbach coupling to a closed channel bound state
leads to a Fano resonance profile for the transmission, which may be mapped out
by RF- or photodissociative spectroscopy. We generalize the scattering length
concept to the one-dimensional lattice, where a scattering length may be
defined at both the lower and the upper continuum thresholds. As a function of
the applied magnetic field the scattering length at either band edge exhibits
the usual Feshbach divergence when a bound state enters or exits the continuum.
Near the scattering length divergences the binding energy and wavefunction of
the weakly bound dimer state acquires a universal form reminiscent of those of
free-space Feshbach molecules. We give numerical examples of our analytic
results for a specific Feshbach resonance, which has been studied
experimentally.

the extra stability to such SHN to have long enough lifetime to be observed. To
investigate whether the so-called &quot;stability island&quot; could really exist around

values from three different mass formulae prescribed by Koura, Uno, Tachibana,
Yamada (KUTY), Myers, Swiatecki (MS) and Muntian, Hofmann, Patyk, Sobiczewski

carried out using a phenomenological formula and compared with SF half lives
predicted by Smolanczuk {\it et al}. Possible source of discrepancy between the
calculated $\alpha$-decay half lives of some nuclei and the experimental data

highest $\alpha$-decay half life ($T_\alpha \sim 3.2hrs$) using $Q_\alpha$
value from MMM. Interestingly, it is much greater than the recently measured
$T_\alpha$ ($\sim 22s$) of deformed doubly magic $^{270}_{108}Hs_{162}$

$^{294}110_{184}$, $^{293}110_{183}$, $^{296}112_{184}$ and $^{298}114_{184}$.

  engineering</title><description>  Manipulation of superpositions of discrete quantum states has a mathematical
counterpart in the motion of a unit-length statevector in an N-dimensional
Hilbert space. Any such statevector motion can be regarded as a succession of
two-dimensional rotations. But the desired statevector change can also be
treated as a succession of reflections, the generalization of Householder
transformations. In multidimensional Hilbert space such reflection sequences
offer more efficient procedures for statevector manipulation than do sequences
of rotations. We here show how such reflections can be designed for a system
with two degenerate levels - a generalization of the traditional two-state atom
- that allows the construction of propagators for angular momentum states. We
use the Morris-Shore transformation to express the propagator in terms of
Morris-Shore basis states and Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to
connect properties of laser pulses to Hilbert-space motion. Under suitable
conditions on the couplings and the common detuning, the propagators within
each set of degenerate states represent products of generalized Householder
reflections, with orthogonal vectors. We propose physical realizations of this
novel geometrical object with resonant, near-resonant and far-off-resonant
laser pulses. We give several examples of implementations in real atoms or
molecules.

Morris-Shore transformation to the solution of a two-state system involving
only the excited state and a (bright) superposition of ground states. In
addition, there are N-1 dark states composed of ground states. We use this
decomposition to derive analytical solutions for degenerate extensions of the

Landau-Zener, Rosen-Zener, Allen-Eberly and Demkov-Kunike models. We suggest
various applications of the multistate solutions, for example, as tools for
creating multistate coherent superpositions by generalized resonant pi-pulses.
We show that such generalized pi-pulses can occur even when the upper state is
far off resonance, at special detunings, which makes it possible to operate in
the degenerate ground-state manifold without populating the (possibly lossy)

process of spontaneous emission is investigated. A threshold effect for the
creation of entanglement is found that the initially unentangled qubits can be
entangled after a finite time despite the fact that the coherence between the
qubits exists for all times. This delayed creation of entanglement, that we
call sudden birth of entanglement, is opposite to the currently extensively
discussed sudden death of entanglement and is characteristic for transient
dynamics of one-photon entangled states of the system. We determine the
threshold time for the creation of entanglement and find that it is related to
time at which the antisymmetric state remains the only excited state being
populated. It is shown that the threshold time can be controlled by the
distance between the qubits and the direction of initial excitation relative to
the interatomic axis. This effect suggests a new alternative for the study of
entanglement and provides an interesting resource for creation on demand of

such as the full unitary group to closed subgroups like partitionings by
factorisation into tensor products, where the finest partitioning consists of
purely local unitary operations. Moreover, the common framework is kept
sufficiently general and allows for setting up gradient flows on
(sub-)manifolds, Lie (sub-)groups, quotient groups, and reductive homogeneous
spaces. Relevant convergence conditions are discussed meant to serve as
justification for recent and new achievements, and as foundation for further
research.
  Exploiting the differential geometry of quantum dynamics under different
scenarios helps to provide highly useful algorithms: (a) On an abstract level,
gradient flows may establish the exact upper bounds of pertinent quality
functions, i.e. upper bounds reachable within the underlying manifold of the
state space dynamics; (b) in a second stage referring to a concrete
experimental setting, gradient flows on the manifold of piecewise constant
control amplitudes $\R^m$ may be set up to provide (approximations to) optimal
control of quantum devices under realistic conditions.
  Illustrative examples and new applications are given relating to distance
measures of pure-state entanglement. We establish the correspondence to best

deterioration of initial quantum resources, understood as the entanglement
initially shared by the input system with some reference purifying it. One
effective way to measure such a deterioration is by measuring the loss of
coherent information, namely the difference between the initial coherent
information and the final one: such a difference is ``small'', if and only if
the action of the channel can be ``almost perfectly'' corrected with
probability one. In this work, we generalise this result to different
entanglement loss functions, notably including the entanglement of formation
loss, and prove that many inequivalent entanglement measures lead to equivalent
conditions for approximate quantum error correction. In doing this, we show how
different measures of bipartite entanglement give rise to corresponding
distance-like functions between quantum channels, and we investigate how these
induced distances are related to the cb-norm.

system is broken. When quantum effects were taken into account, it was found on
the one hand, that quantum noise is able to induce a random rotation on this
classically emitted mode. On the other hand, the analysis of a balanced
homodyne detection in which the local oscillator (LO) was orthogonal to the
excited mode at any time, showed that squeezing in the quadrature selected by
the LO was found for every phase of this one, squeezing being perfect for a
pi/2 phase. This last fact revealed an apparent paradox: If all quadratures are
below shot noise level, the uncertainty principle seems to be violated. In [1]

the rotating orthogonal mode do not form a canonical pair, and the extra noise
is transferred to the diffusing orientation. Thes notes are devoted to prove

schemes are different for different input states to achieve this limit. We show
that it is possible to achieve this limit just by the parity measurement for
all the commonly proposed entangled states. Based on the parity measurement
scheme, the reductions of the phase sensitivity in the presence of photon loss
are examined for the various input states.

presence of the external magnetic field $\Gamma$ applied in the transverse
direction. We derive the replica-symmetric free energy functional within static
approximation and the saddle-point equation for the order parameter: the
distribution $P[h(m)]$ of functions of magnetizations. The order parameter is
interpreted as the histogram of probability distributions of individual
magnetizations. In the limit of zero temperature and small transverse fields,
to leading order in $\Gamma$ magnetizations $m \approx 0$ become relevant in
addition to purely classical values of $m \approx \pm 1$. Self-consistency
equations for the order parameter are solved numerically using Quasi Monte
Carlo method for K=3. It is shown that for an arbitrarily small $\Gamma$
quantum fluctuations destroy the phase transition present in the classical
limit $\Gamma=0$, replacing it with a smooth crossover transition. The
implications of this result with respect to the expected performance of quantum
optimization algorithms via adiabatic evolution are discussed. The
replica-symmetric solution of the classical random $K$-Satisfiability problem
is briefly revisited. It is shown that the phase transition at T=0 predicted by
the replica-symmetric theory is of continuous type with atypical critical
exponents.

  Mechanics</title><description>  Recent years have seen increased interest in complexified Bohmian mechanical
trajectory calculations for quantum systems, both as a pedagogical and
computational tool. In the latter context, it is essential that trajectories
satisfy probability conservation, to ensure they are always guided to where
they are most needed. In this paper, probability conservation for complexified
Bohmian trajectories is considered. The analysis relies on time-reversal
symmetry considerations, leading to a generalized expression for the
conjugation of wavefunctions of complexified variables. This in turn enables
meaningful discussion of complexified flux continuity, which turns out not to
be satisfied in general, though a related property is found to be true. The
main conclusion, though, is that even under a weak interpretation, probability
is not conserved along complex Bohmian trajectories.

This quantization let us describe and solution problems originated by

aspects which only can be observed through the quantization of a game like the
possibility of the entanglement between players, the definition of a

method of time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (t-DMRG), we go
beyond the uniform coupling central spin model and evaluate nonperturbatively
the induced decoherence and entanglement. It is shown that both decoherence and
entanglement strongly depend on the phase of the underlying spin bath. We show
that in general, spin baths can induce entanglement for an initially
disentangled pair of qubits. Furthermore, when the spin bath is in the
ferromagnetic phase, because qubits directly couple to the order parameter, the
reduced dynamics shows oscillatory type behavior. On the other hand, only for
paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, initially entangled states suffer
from the entanglement sudden death. By calculating concurrence, the finite
disentanglement time is mapped out for all phases in the phase diagram of the

fundamentally new way of constructing theories of physics. The motivation comes
from a desire to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating
quantum theories of space and time. In doing so we provide a new answer to
Heidegger's timeless question ``What is a thing?''.
  Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent
to finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is
attached to the system. Classical physics uses the topos of sets. Other
theories involve a different topos. For the types of theory discussed in this
paper, a key goal is to represent any physical quantity $A$ with an arrow
$\breve{A}_\phi:\Si_\phi\map\R_\phi$ where $\Si_\phi$ and $\R_\phi$ are two
special objects (the `state-object' and `quantity-value object') in the
appropriate topos, $\tau_\phi$.
  We discuss two different types of language that can be attached to a system,
$S$. The first, $\PL{S}$, is a propositional language; the second, $\L{S}$, is
a higher-order, typed language. Both languages provide deductive systems with
an intuitionistic logic. With the aid of $\PL{S}$ we expand and develop some of
the earlier work (By CJI and collaborators.) on topos theory and quantum
physics. A key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which a projection
operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf $\Sig$--the topos
quantum analogue of a classical state space. The topos concerned is $\SetH{}$:
the category of contravariant set-valued functors on the category (partially
ordered set) $\V{}$ of commutative sub-algebras of the algebra of bounded
operators on the quantum Hilbert space $\Hi$.

simultaneous achievability of the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound for the parameters

show that the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound for output states of dissipative low-noise

D \leq N-1, where D and N denote the number of the parameters and the dimension

subsystem codes over symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels -- qubit-flip
and phase-shift errors may have equal or different probabilities. Previous work
in constructing quantum error control codes has focused on code constructions
for symmetric quantum channels. In this paper, we develop a theory and
establish the connection between asymmetric quantum codes and subsystem codes.
We present families of subsystem and asymmetric quantum codes derived, once
again, from classical BCH and RS codes over finite fields. Particularly, we
derive an interesting asymmetric and symmetric subsystem codes based on
classical BCH codes with parameters $[[n,k,r,d]]_q$, $[[n,k,r,d_z/d_x]]_q$ and
$[[n,k',0,d_z/d_x]]_q$ for arbitrary values of code lengths and dimensions. We
establish asymmetric Singleton and Hamming bounds on asymmetric quantum and
subsystem code parameters; and derive optimal asymmetric MDS subsystem codes.
Finally, our constructions are well explained by an illustrative example.
  This paper is written on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the
discovery of classical BCH codes and their quantum counterparts were derived
nearly 10 years ago.

objective in a subspace of the Hilbert space while avoiding other subspaces of
the Hilbert space. The primary objective can be a state-to-state transition or
a unitary transformation. A new optimization functional is introduced which
leads to monotonic convergence of the algorithm. This approach becomes
necessary for molecular systems subject to processes implying loss of coherence
such as predissociation or ionization. In these subspaces controllability is
hampered or even completely lost. Avoiding the lossy channels is achieved via a
functional constraint which depends on the state of the system at each instant
in time. We outline the resulting new algorithm, discuss its convergence
properties and demonstrate its functionality for the example of a
state-to-state transition and of a unitary transformation for a model of cold

constituents, observables evolving in time under a local Hamiltonian will
essentially grow linearly in their support, up to exponentially suppressed
corrections. In this work, we formulate Lieb-Robinson bounds for general
harmonic systems on general lattices, for which the constituents are
infinite-dimensional, as systems representing discrete versions of free fields
or the harmonic approximation to the Bose-Hubbard model. We consider both local
interactions as well as infinite-ranged interactions, showing how corrections
to locality are inherited from the locality of the Hamiltonian: Local
interactions result in stronger than exponentially suppressed corrections,
while non-local algebraic interactions result in algebraic suppression. We
derive bounds for canonical operators, Weyl operators and outline
generalization to arbitrary operators. As an example, we discuss the
Klein-Gordon field, and see how the approximate locality in the lattice model
becomes the exact causality in the field limit. We discuss the applicability of
these results to quenched lattice systems far from equilibrium, and the

Using simple transition-rate arguments and a semiclassical calculation, we

We start by analyzing a simplified two-level-atom model, and we then analyze a

  quenching of the transverse field</title><description>  We study the quenching dynamics of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 $XY$ model in a
transverse field when the transverse field $h(=t/\tau)$ is quenched repeatedly
between $-\infty$ and $+\infty$. A single passage from $h \to - \infty$ to $h
\to +\infty$ or the other way around is referred to as a half-period of
quenching. For an even number of half-periods, the transverse field is brought
back to the initial value of $-\infty$; in the case of an odd number of
half-periods, the dynamics is stopped at $h \to +\infty$. The density of
defects produced due to the non-adiabatic transitions is calculated by mapping
the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener problem and is generally
found to vary as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$ for large $\tau$; however, the magnitude is
found to depend on the number of half-periods of quenching. For two successive
half-periods, the defect density is found to decrease in comparison to a single
half-period, suggesting the existence of a corrective mechanism in the reverse
path. A similar behavior of the density of defects and the local entropy is
observed for repeated quenching. The defect density decays as $1/{\sqrt\tau}$
for large $\tau$ for any number of half-periods, and shows a increase in kink
density for small $\tau$ for an even number; the entropy shows qualitatively
the same behavior for any number of half-periods. The probability of
non-adiabatic transitions and the local entropy saturate to 1/2 and $\ln 2$,
respectively, for a large number of repeated quenching.

  statistical field theory (PCSFT)</title><description>  This paper is devoted to such a fundamental problem of quantum computing as
quantum parallelism. It is well known that quantum parallelism is the basis of
the ability of quantum computer to perform in polynomial time computations
performed by classical computers for exponential time. Therefore better
understanding of quantum parallelism is important both for theoretical and
applied research, cf. e.g. David Deutsch \cite{DD}. We present a realistic
interpretation based on recently developed prequantum classical statistical
field theory (PCSFT). In the PCSFT-approach to QM quantum states (mixed as well
as pure) are labels of special ensembles of classical fields. Thus e.g. a
single (!) ``electron in the pure state'' $\psi$ can be identified with a
special `` electron random field,'' say $\Phi_\psi(\phi).$ Quantum computer
operates with such random fields. By one computational step for e.g. a Boolean
function $f(x_1,...,x_n)$ the initial random field $\Phi_{\psi_0}(\phi)$ is
transformed into the final random field $\Phi_{\psi_f}(\phi)$ ``containing all
values'' of $f.$ This is the objective of quantum computer's ability to operate
quickly with huge amounts of information -- in fact, with classical random
fields.

Weak interactions lead to a weakly mixed state, which in 3D can be understood

our two examples corrects an arbitrary single-qubit error. Our first example is
a degenerate six-qubit quantum error-correcting code. We explicitly provide the
stabilizer generators, encoding circuit, codewords, logical Pauli operators,
and logical CNOT operator for this code. We also show how to convert this code
into a non-trivial subsystem code that saturates the subsystem Singleton bound.
We then prove that a six-qubit code without entanglement assistance cannot
simultaneously possess a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) stabilizer and correct an
arbitrary single-qubit error. A corollary of this result is that the Steane
seven-qubit code is the smallest single-error correcting CSS code. Our second
example is the construction of a non-degenerate six-qubit CSS
entanglement-assisted code. This code uses one bit of entanglement (an ebit)
shared between the sender and the receiver and corrects an arbitrary
single-qubit error. The code we obtain is globally equivalent to the Steane
seven-qubit code and thus corrects an arbitrary error on the receiver's half of
the ebit as well. We prove that this code is the smallest code with a CSS
structure that uses only one ebit and corrects an arbitrary single-qubit error
on the sender's side. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages for each of
the two codes.

which ensures increase of entropy, makes the system evolve from an initial pure
state to a mixed state of the Werner type, and (ii) the space of the objective

reaches similar values in the two cases but the Coulomb interaction shifts the
maximum rates towards larger separations between the dots. The difference in
electron-phonon interaction between deformation potential and piezoelectric
coupling is investigated. We show that the phonon-induced tunneling between
two-electron singlet states is a fast process, taking place on the time scales
of the order of a few tens of picoseconds.

coupled to a microwave cavity. If the nanoresonator can be cooled to near its
quantum ground state then quantum squeezing of a quadrature of the
nanoresonator motion becomes feasible. We consider the adiabatic limit in which
the cavity mode is slaved to the nanoresonator mode. By driving the cavity on
its red-detuned sideband, the squeezing can be coupled into the microwave field
at the cavity resonance. The red-detuned sideband drive is also compatible with
the goal of ground state cooling. Squeezing of the output microwave field may
be inferred using a technique similar to that used to infer squeezing of the

in photons Bragg-scattered by the condensates. Upon coincident detection of two
photons by two detectors, the projected joint state of two condensates is shown

  condensates expanding in disordered potentials</title><description>  We theoretically investigate the localization of an expanding Bose-Einstein
condensate with repulsive atom-atom interactions in a disordered potential. We
focus on the regime where the initial inter-atomic interactions dominate over
the kinetic energy and the disorder. At equilibrium in a trapping potential and
for small disorder, the condensate shows a Thomas-Fermi shape modified by the
disorder. When the condensate is released from the trap, a strong suppression
of the expansion is obtained in contrast to the situation in a periodic
potential with similar characteristics. This effect crucially depends on both
the momentum distribution of the expanding BEC and the strength of the
disorder. For strong disorder, the suppression of the expansion results from
the fragmentation of the core of the condensate and from classical reflections
from large modulations of the disordered potential in the tails of the
condensate. We identify the corresponding disorder-induced trapping scenario
for which large atom-atom interactions and strong reflections from single
modulations of the disordered potential play central roles. For weak disorder,
the suppression of the expansion signals the onset of Anderson localization,
which is due to multiple scattering from the modulations of the disordered
potential. We compute analytically the localized density profile of the
condensate and show that the localization crucially depends on the correlation
function of the disorder. In particular, for speckle potentials the long-range
correlations induce an effective mobility edge in 1D finite systems. Numerical
calculations performed in the mean-field approximation support our analysis for
both strong and weak disorder.

demonstrate that optical coherence of a confined exciton qubit exposed to

of a simple periodic sequence of control pulses. The shape of the quantum dot
has a significant effect on the dephasing properties. Remarkably, we find that
quantum dots with parameters optimized for implementing quantum computation are
among the most susceptible to dephasing, yet periodic decoupling is most
efficient for exactly that type of dot. We also show that the presence of an

the exchange of information in a network. Large-scale quantum communication (of
the order of 100 km) has been achieved; however, serious problems occur beyond
this distance scale, mainly due to inevitable photon loss in the transmission
channel. Quantum communication eventually fails when the probability of a dark
count in the photon detectors becomes comparable to the probability that a
photon is correctly detected. To overcome this problem, Briegel, D\&quot;{u}r, Cirac
and Zoller (BDCZ) introduced the concept of quantum repeaters, combining
entanglement swapping and quantum memory to efficiently extend the achievable
distances. Although entanglement swapping has been experimentally demonstrated,
the implementation of BDCZ quantum repeaters has proved challenging owing to
the difficulty of integrating a quantum memory. Here we realize entanglement
swapping with storage and retrieval of light, a building block of the BDCZ
quantum repeater. We follow a scheme that incorporates the strategy of BDCZ
with atomic quantum memories. Two atomic ensembles, each originally entangled
with a single emitted photon, are projected into an entangled state by
performing a joint Bell state measurement on the two single photons after they
have passed through a 300-m fibre-based communication channel. The entanglement
is stored in the atomic ensembles and later verified by converting the atomic
excitations into photons. Our method is intrinsically phase insensitive and
establishes the essential element needed to realize quantum repeaters with
stationary atomic qubits as quantum memories and flying photonic qubits as
quantum messengers.

condensate systems, the method is designed for systems with a natural
separation into highly occupied (condensed) modes and lightly occupied modes.
The method self-consistently uses the Wigner representation to treat highly
occupied modes and the positive-P representation for lightly occupied modes. In
this method, truncation of higher-derivative terms from the Fokker-Planck
equation is usually necessary. However, at least in the cases investigated
here, the resulting systematic error, over a finite time, vanishes in the limit
of large Wigner occupation numbers. We tested the method on a system of two
interacting anharmonic oscillators, with high and low occupations,
respectively. The Hybrid method successfully predicted atomic quadratures to a
useful simulation time 60 times longer than that of the positive-P method. The
truncated Wigner method also performed well in this test. For the prediction of
the correlation in a quantum nondemolition measurement scheme, for this same
system, the Hybrid method gave excellent agreement with the exact result, while
the truncated Wigner method showed a large systematic error.

appearing in the new Hamiltonian explains naturally the recent experimental
observation of correlated tunneling in a double-well trap with strong atom-atom

where strongly interacting atoms can tunnel back and forth as a fragmented

rise to the insulator state with fixed time-averaged value of
atom-occupation-number only. Quantum phase transitions between two quantum
phases characterized by degenerate and non-degenerate ground states are shown
to be coinciding with the Landau second-order phase transition theory. In the

the oscillator is highly excited. We find that the two-level system transition
energy is shifted, producing a Bloch-Siegert shift in each two-level system
similar to what would be obtained if the other were absent. At resonances
associated with energy exchange between a two-level system and the oscillator,
the level splitting is about the same as would be obtained in the spin-boson
model at a Bloch-Siegert resonance. However, there occur resonances associated
with the transfer of excitation between one two-level system and the other, an
effect not present in the spin-boson model. We use a unitary transformation
leading to a rotated system in which terms responsible for the shift and
splittings can be identified. The level splittings at the anticrossings
associated with both energy exchange and excitation transfer resonances are
accounted for with simple two-state models and degenerate perturbation theory
using operators that appear in the rotated Hamiltonian.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) QIPs offer an excellent test-bed on which to

issues to consider when designing control methods are accuracy and efficiency,
for which two complementary approaches have been developed so far to control
qubit registers with liquid-state NMR methods. The first applies optimal

both of these methods. Furthermore, we show that taken together, they form a

great effort must be taken to protect the integrity of a fragile quantum bit.
Nuclear spins are known to benefit from long coherence times compared to
electron spins, but are slow to manipulate and suffer from weak thermal
polarisation. A powerful model for quantum computation is thus one in which
electron spins are used for processing and readout while nuclear spins are used
for storage. Here we demonstrate the coherent transfer of a superposition state
in an electron spin 'processing' qubit to a nuclear spin 'memory' qubit, using
a combination of microwave and radiofrequency pulses applied to 31P donors in
an isotopically pure 28Si crystal. The electron spin state can be stored in the
nuclear spin on a timescale that is long compared with the electron decoherence
time and then coherently transferred back to the electron spin, thus
demonstrating the 31P nuclear spin as a solid-state quantum memory. The overall
store/readout fidelity is about 90%, attributed to systematic imperfections in
radiofrequency pulses which can be improved through the use of composite
pulses. We apply dynamic decoupling to protect the nuclear spin quantum memory
element from sources of decoherence. The coherence lifetime of the quantum
memory element is found to exceed one second at 5.5K.

comprising large numbers of physical qubits for storing and processing quantum

on microfabricated devices known as atom chips, as almost arbitrary trap
configurations can be realised in a robust and compact package. Until now,
however, atom chip experiments have focused on small systems incorporating
single or only a few individual traps. Here we report experiments on a
two-dimensional array of trapped ultracold atom clouds prepared using a simple
magnetic-film atom chip. We are able to load atoms into hundreds of tightly
confining and optically resolved array sites. We then cool the individual atom
clouds in parallel to the critical temperature required for quantum degeneracy.
Atoms are shuttled across the chip surface utilising the atom chip as an atomic
shift register and local manipulation of atoms is implemented using a focused
laser to rapidly empty individual traps.

  Vacuums</title><description>  In this paper, a protocol is proposed in which energy extraction from local
vacuum states is possible by using quantum measurement information for the
vacuum state of quantum fields. In the protocol, Alice, who stays at a spatial
point, excites the ground state of the fields by a local measurement.
Consequently, wavepackects generated by A' measurement propagate the vacuum to
spatial infinity. Let us assume that Bob stays away from Alice and fails to
catch the excitation energy when the wavepackets pass in front of him. Next
Alice announces her local measurement result to Bob by classical communication.
Bob performs a local unitary operation depending on the measurement result. In
this process, positive energy is released from the fields to Bob's apparatus of
the unitary operation. In the field systems, wavepackets are generated with
negative energy around Bob's location. Soon afterwards, the negative -energy
wavepackets begin to chase after the positive-energy wavepackets generated by
Alice and form loosely bound states.

the Langevin field operators for photon pairs produced by a double Raman atom
driven by laser pulses. Short pulses with appropriate chirping, delay and/or
detuning can generate broadband photon pairs and yield results that provide
insights on how to generate very large nonclassical correlation. We find that
short pulses are not favorable for entanglement. The quantity was previously
found to be phase-sensitive and this is used with the pulse area concept to
explain the rapid variations of entanglement with pulse width and strength.
Photon correlation and entanglement are favored by exclusively two different
initial conditions. Analysis reinforces our understanding of the two

classical logic operations on quantum data, e.g., reversible arithmetic
circuits. In physical implementations, however, TOFFOLI gates are decomposed
into six CNOT gates and several one-qubit gates. Though this decomposition has
been known for at least 10 years, we provide here the first demonstration of
its CNOT-optimality.
  We study three-qubit circuits which contain less than six CNOT gates and
implement a block-diagonal operator, then show that they implicitly describe
the cosine-sine decomposition of a related operator. Leveraging the canonicity
of such decompositions to limit one-qubit gates appearing in respective
circuits, we prove that the n-qubit analogue of the TOFFOLI requires at least
2n CNOT gates. Additionally, our results offer a complete classification of
three-qubit diagonal operators by their CNOT-cost, which holds even if ancilla
qubits are available.

scattering problem below the three-particle breakup. That is, the wave function
of the scattering particles in any open channel is the asymptotics of the

effect is achieved due to the new relation between three internal coordinates
of the three-body system and the parameters of $\phi_j(\xi,\eta)$. It ensures
the orthogonality of $\phi_j(\xi,\eta)$ on the sphere of a constant
hyperradius, $\rho=const$, in place of the surface
$R=|\bi{x}_2-\bi{x}_1|=const$ appearing in the traditional Born-Oppenheimer

coordinates on that sphere with three poles in the coalescence points. They are
connected with the elliptic coordinates on the plane by means of the
stereographic projection. For the total angular momentum $J\ge 0$ the products
of $\phi_j$ and the Wigner $D$-functions form the hyperspherical Coulomb

source. Recently, there are various practical proposals of the decoy state QKD
with triggering PDC sources. In this paper, we generalize the passive decoy
state idea, originally proposed by Mauerer and Silberhorn. The generalized
passive decoy state idea can be applied to cases where either threshold
detectors or photon number resolving detectors are used. The decoy state
protocol proposed by Adachi, Yamamoto, Koashi and Imoto (AYKI) can be treated
as a special case of the generalized passive decoy state method. By simulating
a recent PDC experiment, we compare various practical decoy state protocols
with the infinite decoy protocol and also compare the cases using threshold
detectors and photon-number resolving detectors. Our simulation result shows
that with the AYKI protocol, one can achieve a key generation rate that is
close to the theoretical limit of infinite decoy protocol. Furthermore, our
simulation result shows that a photon-number resolving detector appears to be
not very useful for improving QKD performance in this case. Although our
analysis is focused on the QKD with PDC sources, we emphasize that it can also
be applied to other QKD setups with triggered single photon sources.

hadrons that we observe in the real world, there are many theories about how
many of them are needed and what quantum numbers they carry. Another important
question is what keeps them inside the hadron, which is known to have
space-time extension. Since they are relativistic objects, how would the hadron
appear to observers in different Lorentz frames? The hadron moving with speed
close to that of light appears as a collection of Feynman's partons. In other
words, the same object looks differently to observers in two different frames,
as Einstein's energy-momentum relation takes different forms for those
observers. In order to explain this, it is necessary to construct a quantum
bound-state picture valid in all Lorentz frames. It is noted that Paul A. M.
Dirac studied this problem of constructing relativistic quantum mechanics
beginning in 1927. It is noted further that he published major papers in this
field in 1945, 1949, 1953, and in 1963. By combining these works by Dirac, it
is possible to construct a Lorentz-covariant theory which can explain hadronic
phenomena in the static and high-speed limits, as well as in between. It is
shown also that this Lorentz-covariant bound-state picture can explain what we
observe in high-energy laboratories, including the parton distribution function
and the behavior of the proton form factor.

loops that cannot be removed by special relativistic or standard quantum
mechanical considerations alone. However, the paradox is resolved when we apply
the qRule foundation theory that is developed in the other paper. The causal
and temporal orders of state reduction are then found to be in agreement with
one another, and the resulting boundaries in Minkowski space are shown to have
a novel architecture that limits the range of a Hellwig-Kraus reduction in
space and time. Although these boundaries have been worked out using the
qRules, they should be the same for any foundation theory that treats the
collapse of a wave in an invariant way, and requires that a collapse destroys

irreducible $k$-particle correlation is the correlation appearing in the states
of $k$ particles but not existing in the states of $k-1$ particles. A measure
of the degree of irreducible $k$-particle correlation is defined based on the
maximal entropy construction. By adopting a continuity approach, we overcome
the difficulties in calculating the degrees of irreducible multi-particle

we obtain the degrees of irreducible multi-particle correlations in the

their implementation at the quantum level an outstanding challenge. Here we
demonstrate a nonlinearity for one atom enclosed by two highly reflecting
mirrors. We send laser light through the input mirror and record the light from
the output mirror of the cavity. For weak laser intensity, we find the
vacuum-Rabi resonances. But for higher intensities, we find an additional
resonance. It originates from the fact that the cavity can accommodate only an
integer number of photons and that this photon number determines the
characteristic frequencies of the coupled atom-cavity system. We selectively
excite such a frequency by depositing at once two photons into the system and
find a transmission which increases with the laser intensity squared. The
nonlinearity differs from classical saturation nonlinearities and is direct
spectroscopic proof of the quantum nature of the atom-cavity system. It
provides a photon-photon interaction by means of one atom, and constitutes a
step towards a two-photon gateway or a single-photon transistor.

  micromirror in an optical cavity</title><description>  Laser cooling of a mechanical mode of a resonator by the radiation pressure
of a detuned optical cavity mode has been recently demonstrated by various
groups in different experimental configurations. Here we consider the effect of
a second mechanical mode with a close, but different resonance frequency. We
show that the nearby mechanical resonance is simultaneously cooled by the
cavity field, provided that the difference between the two mechanical
frequencies is not too small. When this frequency difference becomes smaller
than the effective mechanical damping of the secondary mode, the two cooling
processes interfere destructively and cavity cooling is suppressed in the limit
of identical mechanical frequencies. We show that also the entanglement
properties of the steady state of the tripartite system crucially depend upon
on the difference between the two mechanical frequencies. If the latter is
larger than the effective damping of the second mechanical mode, the state
shows fully tripartite entanglement and each mechanical mode is entangled with
the cavity mode. If instead the frequency difference is smaller, the steady
state is a two-mode biseparable state, inseparable only when one splits the
cavity mode from the two mechanical modes. In this latter case, the
entanglement of each mechanical mode with the cavity mode is extremely fragile
with respect to temperature.

constructing a quantum device harnessing the computing power inherent in the
laws of quantum physics. The standard circuit model of quantum computing
requires a universal set of quantum logic gates for the implementation of
arbitrary quantum operations. As in classical models of computation, quantum
error correction techniques enable rectification of small imperfections in gate
operations, thus allowing for perfect computation in the presence of noise. For
fault-tolerant computation, it is commonly believed that error thresholds
ranging between 10^-4 and 10^-2 will be required depending on the noise model
and the computational overhead for realizing the quantum gates. Up to now, all
experimental implementations have fallen short of these requirements. Here, we
report on a Molmer-Sorensen type gate operation entangling ions with a fidelity
of 99.3(1)% which together with single-qubit operations forms a universal set
of quantum gates. The gate operation is performed on a pair of qubits encoded
in two trapped calcium ions using a single amplitude-modulated laser beam
interacting with both ions at the same time. A robust gate operation, mapping
separable states onto maximally entangled states is achieved by adiabatically
switching the laser-ion coupling on and off. We analyse the performance of a
single gate and concatenations of up to 21 gate operations. The gate mechanism
holds great promise not only for two-qubit but also for multi-qubit operations.

  communication complexity and bipartite gate capacities</title><description>  Two dual questions in quantum information theory are to determine the
communication cost of simulating a bipartite unitary gate, and to determine
their communication capacities. We present a bipartite unitary gate with two
surprising properties: 1) simulating it with the assistance of unlimited EPR
pairs requires far more communication than with a better choice of entangled
state, and 2) its communication capacity is far lower than its capacity to
create entanglement. This suggests that 1) unlimited EPR pairs are not the most
general model of entanglement assistance for two-party communication tasks, and
2) the entangling and communicating abilities of a unitary interaction can vary
nearly independently. The technical contribution behind these results is a
communication-efficient protocol for measuring whether an unknown shared state
lies in a specified rank-one subspace or its orthogonal complement.

of the wells are quadratic with a frequency $\omega$ and the difference of the
minima is close to a multiple of $\hbar \omega$. A WKB wave function is
constructed on both sides of the local maximum between the wells, by matching
the WKB function to the exact wave functions near the classical turning points.
The continuities of the wave function and its first derivative at the local
maximum then give the energy-level splitting formula, which not only reproduces
the instanton result for a symmetric potential, but also elucidates the
appearance of resonances of tunneling in the asymmetric potential.

this amplitude tends to zero as $t$ goes to the infinity more slowly than any
exponential function of $t$. Using methods of asymptotic analysis we find the

quantum codes to finding a binary classical code correcting an error pattern
induced by a graph state. Finding such a classical code can be very difficult.
Here, we consider an algorithm which maps the search for CWS codes to a problem
of identifying maximum cliques in a graph. While solving this problem is in
general very hard, we prove three structure theorems which reduce the search
space, specifying certain admissible and optimal ((n,K,d)) additive codes. In
particular, we find there does not exist any ((7,3,3)) CWS code though the
linear programming bound does not rule it out. The complexity of the CWS search
algorithm is compared with the contrasting method introduced by Aggarwal and
Calderbank (arXiv:cs/0610159).

  coarse-graining</title><description>  A novel scheme to simulate the evolution of a restricted set of observables
of a quantum system is proposed. The set comprises the spectrum-generating
algebra of the Hamiltonian. The idea is to consider a certain open-system
evolution, which can be interpreted as a process of weak measurement of the
distinguished observables performed on the evolving system of interest. Given
that the observables are &quot;classical&quot; and the Hamiltonian is moderately
nonlinear, the open system dynamics displays a large time-scales separation
between the dephasing of the observables and the decoherence of the evolving
state in the basis of the generalized coherent states (GCS), associated with
the spectrum-generating algebra. The time scale separation allows the unitary
dynamics of the observables to be efficiently simulated by the open-system
dynamics on the intermediate time-scale.The simulation employs unraveling of
the corresponding master equations into pure state evolutions, governed by the
stochastic nonlinear Schroedinger equantion (sNLSE). It is proved that GCS are
globally stable solutions of the sNLSE, if the Hamilonian is linear in the
algebra elements.

Nonetheless, the resource does limit the type of information that may be

Accordingly, whenever we trace over a region of space, we trace away degrees of

arise when performing local measurements on separate quantum systems. In a
previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 010401 (2007)], we introduced an infinite
hierarchy of conditions necessarily satisfied by any set of quantum
correlations. Each of these conditions could be tested using semidefinite
programming. We present here new results concerning this hierarchy. We prove in
particular that it is complete, in the sense that any set of correlations
satisfying every condition in the hierarchy has a quantum representation in
terms of commuting measurements. Although our tests are conceived to rule out
non-quantum correlations, and can in principle certify that a set of
correlations is quantum only in the asymptotic limit where all tests are
satisfied, we show that in some cases it is possible to conclude that a given
set of correlations is quantum after performing only a finite number of tests.
We provide a criterion to detect when such a situation arises, and we explain
how to reconstruct the quantum states and measurement operators reproducing the
given correlations. Finally, we present several applications of our approach.
We use it in particular to bound the quantum violation of various Bell

(ii) the measurement operators satisfy the constraints. For example, the

  We show that if an instance of the quantum moment problem is unsatisfiable,

  A special case of the quantum moment problem is to compute the value of

unimodular: what kind of geometry can be ascribed to such FCSs? Here, we
(partially) answer this question for $n=2$ when $R$ is the (unique)
non-commutative ring of order eight. The corresponding geometry is dubbed a
&quot;Fano-Snowflake&quot; due to its diagrammatic appearance and the fact that it
contains the Fano plane in its center. There exist, in fact, two such
configurations -- each being tied to either of the two maximal ideals of the
ring -- which have the Fano plane in common and can, therefore, be viewed as
twins. Potential relevance of these noteworthy configurations to quantum
information theory and stringy black holes is also outlined.

generalized phase gate G is a symmetry for both noisy and noiseless quantum
walk on a line, in the sense that it leaves the position probability
distribution invariant. However, this symmetry breaks down in the case of a
quantum walk on an n-cycle, and hence can be regarded as a probe of the walk
topology. Noise, modelled here as phase flip and generalized amplitude damping
channels, tends to restore the symmetry because it classicalizes the walk.
However, symmetry restoration happens even in the regime where the walker is
not entirely classical, because noise also has the effect of desensitizing the
operation G to the walk topology. We discuss methods for physical
implementation, and talk about the wider implications to condensed matter
systems.

cosmology models, refinement of the underlying lattice is necessary. The
lattice refinement leads to new dynamical difference equations which, in
general, do not have a uniform step-size, implying complications in their
analysis and solutions. We propose a numerical method based on Taylor
expansions, which can give us the necessary information to calculate the
wave-function at any given lattice point. The method we propose can be applied
in any lattice-refined model, while in addition the accuracy of the method can
be estimated. Moreover, we confirm numerically the stability criterion which
was earlier found following a von Neumann analysis. Finally, the `motion' of
the wave-function due to the underlying discreteness of the space-time is
investigated, for both a constant lattice, as well as lattice refinement

indefinite causal structure. Indefinite causal structure poses particular
problems for theory formulation since many of the core ideas used in the usual
approaches to theory construction depend on having definite causal structure.
For example, the notion of a state across space evolving in time requires that
we have some definite causal structure so we can define a state on a space-like
hypersurface. We will see that many of these problems are mitigated if we are
able to formulate the theory in a &quot;formalism local&quot; (or F-local) fashion. A
formulation of a physical theory is said to be F-local if, in making
predictions for any given arbitrary space-time region, we need only refer to
mathematical objects pertaining to that region. This is a desirable property
both on the grounds of efficiency and since, if we have indefinite causal
structure, it is not clear how to select some other space-time region on which
our calculations may depend. The usual ways of formulating physical theories
(the time evolving state picture, the histories approach, and the local
equations approach) are not F-local.
  We set up a framework for probabilistic theories with indefinite causal
structure. This, the causaloid framework, is F-local. We describe how Quantum
Theory can be formulated in the causaloid framework (in an F-local fashion).
This provides yet another formulation of Quantum Theory. This formulation,
however, may be particularly relevant to the problem of finding a theory of
Quantum Gravity.

maximum phase sensitivity is in general not the same as the phase at which the
slope of the interference fringe is a maximum, as has previously been assumed.
We determine the parameter range where quantum enhanced sensitivity can be
achieved. In order to illustrate these theoretical results, we perform a four

imaginary} time is associated with the stochastic acausal behaviour of a state,
while the {\it real} time is associated with the deterministic causal evolution
of a state. For the tunneling case the nonzero imaginary time is associated
with the transmission rate of the tunneling process, which is related to the
thickness of the barrier. The physical meaning of the zero real time is that
the particle instantly jumps from one side of the barrier to the other
regardless of the thickness. This leads to the illusion that tunneling
particles could actually travel faster than light. The results of recent

the first experimental confirmation of the existence of imaginary time.

bosons, when the bosons occupy significantly only few modes. The approach is
based on an analogy with the dynamics of a single particle of either positive
or negative mass in a quantum potential, where the inverse number of bosons
plays the role of Planck constant. As application of the method we consider the
Bose-Einstein condensate in a double-well trap. The ground state of positive
mass particle corresponds to the mean-field fixed point of lower energy, while
that of negative mass to the excited fixed point. In the case of attractive BEC
above the threshold for symmetry breaking, the ground state is a cat state and
we relate this fact to the double-well shape of the quantum potential for the
positive mass quantum particle. The tunneling energy splitting between the
local Fock states of the cat state is shown to be extremely small for the
nonlinearity parameter just above the critical value and exponentially
decreasing with the number of atoms. In the repulsive case, the phase locked
($\pi$-phase) macroscopic quantum self-trapping of BEC is related to the
double-well structure of the potential for the negative mass quantum particle.
We also analyze the running phase macroscopic quantum self-trapping state and
show that it is subject to quantum collapses and revivals. Moreover, the
quantum dynamics just before the first collapse of the running phase shows
exponential growth of dispersion of the quantum phase distribution which may
explain the growth of the phase fluctuations seen in the experiment on the
macroscopic quantum self-trapping.

that decoherence increases with increasing distance. In the weak coupling

distance when the latter is over a saturation length $l$. Numerical results for
the Ising chain suggest that the saturation scale is related to the correlation
length $\xi$. For strong coupling we display evidence of the existence of
non--Markovian effects (such as environment--induced interactions between the

``sudden deaths and revivals'' of entanglement, with a time scale related to

conserving interaction is of order N^2, while that one induced by the energy
exchange interaction is of the order N only. Moreover, the diagonal matrix
elements approach their limiting values at a rate independent of N.
  For a general spin system the decay rates depend in a rather complicated (but

associated guidance law in the trajectory interpretation of quantum mechanics
for spin-1/2 particles. In the nonrelativistic domain this implies a guidance
law for electrons which differs by an additional spin-dependent term from the
one originally proposed by de Broglie and Bohm. Although the additional term in
the guidance equation may not be detectable in the quantum measurements derived
solely from the probability density $\rho$, it plays a role in the case of
arrival-time measurements. In this paper we compute the arrival time
distribution and the mean arrival time at a given location, with and without
the spin contribution, for two problems: 1) a symmetrical Gaussian packet in a
uniform field and 2) a symmetrical Gaussian packet passing through a 1D
barrier. Using the Runge-Kutta method for integration of the guidance law,
Bohmian paths of these problems are also computed.

involving any number of bosonic modes and present a normal form. The maximum
number of auxiliary modes that is needed is identified, including all rank
deficient cases, and the specific role of additive classical noise is
highlighted. By using this analysis, we derive a canonical matrix form of the
noisy evolution of n-mode bosonic Gaussian channels and of their weak
complementary counterparts, based on a recent generalization of the normal mode
decomposition for non-symmetric or locality constrained situations. It allows
us to simplify the weak-degradability classification. Moreover, we investigate
the structure of some singular multi-mode channels, like the additive classical
noise channel that can be used to decompose a noisy channel in terms of a less
noisy one in order to find new sets of maps with zero quantum capacity.
Finally, the two-mode case is analyzed in detail. By exploiting the composition
rules of two-mode maps and the fact that anti-degradable channels cannot be
used to transfer quantum information, we identify sets of two-mode bosonic
channels with zero capacity.

inefficient averaging, whereby the number of control actions increases
exponentially with the system size, and efficient averaging associated to a

expressed in terms of simple quantum-information-theoretic conditions which
must be satisfied by the protocol to be secure. The conditions are uniquely
determined by the ideal functionality F defining the cryptographic task to be
implemented. We then show the following composition result. If quantum
protocols pi_1,...,pi_k securely implement ideal functionalities F_1,...,F_k
according to our security definition, then any purely classical two-party
protocol, which makes sequential calls to F_1,...,F_k, is equally secure as the
protocol obtained by replacing the calls to F_1,...,F_k with the respective
quantum protocols pi_1,...,pi_k. Hence, our approach yields the minimal
security requirements which are strong enough for the typical use of quantum

a system of periodically kicked coupled-tops, where chaos and entanglement
arise from the same physical mechanism. The long-time averaged entanglement as
a function of the position of an initially localized wave packet very closely
correlates with the classical phase space surface of section -- it is nearly
uniform in the chaotic sea, and reproduces the detailed structure of the
regular islands. The uniform value in the chaotic sea is explained by the
random state conjecture. As classically chaotic dynamics take localized
distributions in phase space to random distributions, quantized versions take
localized coherent states to pseudo-random states in Hilbert space. Such random
states are highly entangled, with an average value near that of the maximally
entangled state. For a map with global chaos, we derive that value based on new
analytic results for the typical entanglement in a subspace defined by the
symmetries of the system.
  For a mixed phase space, we use the Percival conjecture to identify a
&quot;chaotic subspace&quot; of the Hilbert space. The typical entanglement, averaged
over the unitarily invariant Haar measure in this subspace, agrees with the
long-time averaged entanglement for initial states in the chaotic sea. In all
cases the dynamically generated entanglement is predicted by a unitary ensemble
of random states, even though the system is time-reversal invariant, and the
Floquet operator is a member of the circular orthogonal ensemble.

that is stable under multiplication by scalars of absolute value 1. A {\em
maximal vector} (for $V$) is a unit vector $\xi\in H$ whose distance to $V$ is
maximum $d(\xi,V)=\sup_{\|\eta\|=1}d(\eta,V)$, $d(\xi,V)$ denoting the distance
from $\xi$ to the set $V$. Maximal vectors generalize the {\em maximally
entangled} unit vectors of quantum theory.
  In general, under a mild regularity hypothesis on $V$, there is a {\em norm}
on $H$ whose restriction to the unit sphere achieves its minimum precisely on
$V$ and its maximum precisely on the set of maximal vectors. This
&quot;entanglement-measuring norm&quot; is unique. There is a corresponding
&quot;entanglement-measuring norm&quot; on the predual of $\mathcal B(H)$ that faithfully
detects entanglement of normal states.
  We apply these abstract results to the analysis of entanglement in
multipartite tensor products $H=H_1\otimes ...\otimes H_N$, and we calculate
both entanglement-measuring norms. In cases for which $\dim H_N$ is relatively
large with respect to the others, we describe the set of maximal vectors in
explicit terms and show that it does not depend on the number of factors of the
Hilbert space $H_1\otimes...\otimes H_{N-1}$.

quantity in broad areas of theoretical physics, from cosmology and field theory

entanglement entropy concept is related, in part, to the fact that it is
defined solely in terms of the many-body density matrix of the system, with no
relation to any particular observables. However, for the same reason, it has
not been clear how to access this quantity experimentally. Here we derive a
universal relation between entanglement entropy and the fluctuations of current
flowing through a quantum point contact (QPC) which opens a way to perform a

with fundamentally limited information content. This property is introduced in
an operational way and gives rise to the existence of mutually complementary
measurements, i.e. a complete knowledge of future outcome in one measurement is
at the expense of complete uncertainty in the others. This is characteristic
feature of the theories and they can be ordered according to the number of
mutually complementary measurements which is also shown to define their
computational abilities. In the theories multipartite states may contain
entanglement and tomography with local measurements is possible. The
classification includes both classical and quantum theory and also generalized
probabilistic theories with higher number of degrees of freedom, for which
operational meaning is given. We also discuss thought experiments
discriminating standard quantum theory from the generalizations.

  concepts, emergent classicality, and decoherence</title><description>  It is now widely accepted that environmental entanglement and the resulting
decoherence processes play a crucial role in the quantum-to-classical
transition and the emergence of &quot;classicality&quot; from quantum mechanics. To this
extent, decoherence is often understood as signifying a break with the
Copenhagen interpretation, and in particular with Bohr's view of the
indispensability of classical concepts. This paper analyzes the relationship
between Bohr's understanding of the quantum-classical divide and his doctrine
of classical concepts and the decoherence-based program of emergent
classicality. By drawing on Howard's reconstruction of Bohr's doctrine of
classical concepts, and by paying careful attention to a hitherto overlooked
disagreement between Heisenberg and Bohr in the 1930s about the placement of
the quantum-classical &quot;cut,&quot; we show that Bohr's view of the quantum-classical
divide can be physically justified by appealing to decoherence. We also discuss
early anticipations of the role of the environment in the quantum-classical
problem in Heisenberg's writings. Finally, we distinguish four different
formulations of the doctrine of classical concepts in an effort to present a
more nuanced assessment of the relationship between Bohr's views and
decoherence that challenges oversimplified statements frequently found in the
literature.

influenced by system's state (feedback). The information for the feedback is
gained from non-disturbating measurements done on an ensemble of identical
non-interacting systems. The situation without feedback is governed by the
adiabatic theorem: adiabatic energy level populations stay constant, while the
adiabatic eigenvectors get a specific phase contribution (Berry phase).
However, under feedback the adiabatic theorem does not hold: the adiabatic
populations satisfy a closed equation of motion that coincides with the
replicator dynamics well-known by its applications in evolutionary game theory.
The feedback generates a new gauge-invariant adiabatic phase, which is free of
the constraints on the Berry phase (e.g., the new phase is non-zero even for
real adiabatic eigenfunctions).

closely related to local $SL(2,\CC)$-invariants including the invariance under
qubit permutations, which has been termed $SL^*$ invariance. In order to single
out the $SL^*$ invariants, we analyze the $SL(2,\CC)$-invariants of four resp.
five qubits and decompose them into irreducible modules for the symmetric group
$S_4$ resp. $S_5$ of qubit permutations. A classifying set of measures of
genuine multipartite entanglement is given by the ideal of the algebra of
$SL^*$-invariants vanishing on arbitrary product states. We find that low
degree homogeneous components of this ideal can be constructed in full by using
the approach introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 72, 012337 (2005)]. Our analysis
highlights an intimate connection between this latter procedure and the
standard methods to create invariants, such as the $\Omega$-process. As the
degrees of invariants increase, the alternative method proves to be
particularly efficient.

corresponds to an estimation procedure where the amount of entanglement is
inferred from the measurements of one or more proper observables. Here we
address optimal estimation of entanglement in the framework of local quantum
estimation theory and derive the optimal observable in terms of the symmetric
logarithmic derivative. We evaluate the quantum Fisher information and, in
turn, the ultimate bound to precision for several families of bipartite states,
either for qubits or continuous variable systems, and for different measures of
entanglement. We found that for discrete variables, entanglement may be
efficiently estimated when it is large, whereas the estimation of weakly
entangled states is an inherently inefficient procedure. For continuous
variable Gaussian systems the effectiveness of entanglement estimation strongly
depends on the chosen entanglement measure. Our analysis makes an important
point of principle and may be relevant in the design of quantum information
protocols based on the entanglement content of quantum states.

directly applicable to quantum key distribution. Specific output states allow
for the heralded creation of N=4 N00N states, which may be used for quantum

resolution in interferometric measurements. In the present paper we analyze the
quantum states obtained by optical parametric amplification of polarization
NOON states. First we study, theoretically and experimentally, the
amplification of a 2-photon state by a collinear Quantum Injected Optical
Parametric Amplifier (QIOPA). We compared the stimulated emission regime with
the spontaneous one, studied by Sciarrino et al. (PRA 77, 012324), finding
comparable visibilities between the two cases but an enhancement of the signal
in the stimulated case. As a second step, we show that the collinear amplifier
cannot be successfully used for amplifying N-photon states with N&gt;2 due to the
intrinsic \lambda/4 oscillation pattern of the crystal. To overcome this
limitation, we propose to adopt a scheme for the amplification of a generic
state based on a non-collinear QIOPA and we show that the state obtained by the
amplification process preserves \lambda/N feature and exhibits a high
resilience to losses. Furthermore, an asymptotic unity visibility can be
obtained when correlation functions with sufficiently high order M are
analyzed.

which quantum systems can be manipulated in a controlled and coherent way. One
of the most important goals now is to build quantum simulators, which would
open up the possibility of exciting experiments probing various theories in
regimes that are not achievable under normal lab circumstances. Here we present
a novel approach to gain detailed control on the quantum simulation of strongly
correlated quantum many-body systems by constructing the explicit quantum
circuits that diagonalize their dynamics. We show that the exact quantum
circuits underlying some of the most relevant many-body Hamiltonians only need
a finite amount of local gates. As a particularly simple instance, the full
dynamics of a one-dimensional Quantum Ising model in a transverse field with
four spins is shown to be reproduced using a quantum circuit of only six local
gates. This opens up the possibility of experimentally producing strongly
correlated states, their time evolution at zero time and even thermal
superpositions at zero temperature. Our method also allows to uncover the exact
circuits corresponding to models that exhibit topological order and to
stabilizer states.

by constructing a random unitary approximation to a general quantum channel.
This approximation can be constructed efficiently, and so it is also applied to

distribution in a quantum many-body system. It is shown that a gauge-like
transformation of the phase of the many-body wave function allows one to
construct a probability generating functional, the Fourier transform of which
with respect to the &quot;gauge&quot; field returns the joint probability distribution to
detect any given number of particles at various locations. The method is
applied to the problem of interference of two independent clouds of
Bose-Einstein condensates, where the initially separated clouds with fixed
boson numbers expand and the density profile image of the overlapping clouds is
registered. In the limit of large particle numbers, the probability to observe
a particular image of the density profile is shown to be given by a sum of
partial probability distributions, each of which corresponds to a noisy image
of interference of two matter waves with definite phase difference. In
agreement with earlier theoretical arguments, interference fringes are,
therefore, expected in any single shot measurement, the fringe pattern randomly
varying from run to run. These results conform to the physical picture where
the Bose-Einstein clouds are in spontaneously symmetry broken states, the
hidden phases of which are revealed by the density profile measurement via the
position of the interference fringes.

evolution of the system can be summarized in terms of two main environmental
induced physical phenomena: decoherence and energy activation. In this Thesis,
we shall show that the latter is a post-decoherence phenomenon. As the energy

  From other point of view, we shall study different attempts to show the
decoherence process in double-slit-like experiments both for charged particles
(electrons) and for neutral particles with permanent dipole moments. In this
context, we shall show that the interaction between the particles and
time-dependent fields induces a time-varying Aharonov phase. In this context,
we shall apply our results to a real matter wave interferometry experiment. We
shall also show under which general conditions the geometry phase of a quantum
open system can be observed.Finally, we shall study the decoherence process
during a quantum phase transition. In this framework, we shall show that it can
be phrased easily in terms of the decoherence functional, without having to use
the master equation. To demonstrate this, we shall consider the decohering
effects due to the displacement of domain boundaries, with implications for the
displacement of defects, in general. We shall see that decoherence arises so
quickly in this event, that it is negligible in comparison to decoherence due
to field fluctuations in the way defined in previous papers.

Deviations from this trend are fluctuations involving a small fraction of a

quantum and classical thermodynamics are in agreement. Can there be drastic
differences between them? Here we address a distinctly quantum mechanical
setting that displays such differences: disturbances of thermal equilibrium
between two-level systems (TLS) and a bath by frequent and brief quantum
(non-demolishing) measurements of the TLS energy-states. If the measurements
are frequent enough to induce either the Zeno or the anti-Zeno regime, namely,
the slowdown or speedup of the TLS relaxation, then the resulting entropy and
temperature of both the system and the bath are found to be completely

bound on entropy. Specifically, we consider the relative entropy between the
vacuum and another state, both reduced to a local region. We propose that, with
the adequate interpretation, the positivity of the relative entropy in this
case constitutes a well defined statement of the bound in flat space. We show
that this version arises naturally from the original derivation of the bound
from the generalized second law when quantum effects are taken into account. In
this formulation the bound holds automatically, and in particular it does not
suffer from the proliferation of the species problem. The results suggest that
while the bound is relevant at the classical level, it does not introduce new
physical constraints semiclassically.

impossibility of simultaneous knowledge of certain observables - in the
formalism of quantum theory. Although this concept is at the heart of quantum
mechanics, the number of these bases is unknown except for systems of dimension
being a power of a prime. We develop the relation between this physical problem
and the mathematical problem of finding the number of mutually orthogonal Latin
squares. We derive in a simple way all known results about the unbiased bases,
find their lower number, and disprove the existence of certain forms of the
bases in dimensions different than power of a prime. Using the Latin squares,
we construct hidden-variable models which efficiently simulate results of
complementary quantum measurements.

  superconducting qubit: I. Echo scheme</title><description>  We propose a scheme in which the quantum coherence of a nanomechanical
resonator can be probed using a superconducting qubit. We consider a mechanical
resonator coupled capacitively to a Cooper-pair box and assume that the
superconducting qubit is tuned to the degeneracy point so that its coherence
time is maximised and the electro-mechanical coupling can be approximated by a
dispersive Hamiltonian. When the qubit is prepared in a superposition of states
this drives the mechanical resonator progressively into a superposition which
in turn leads to apparent decoherence of the qubit. Applying a suitable control
pulse to the qubit allows its population to be inverted resulting in a reversal
of the resonator dynamics. However, the resonator's interactions with its
environment mean that the dynamics is not completely reversible. We show that
this irreversibility is largely due to the decoherence of the mechanical
resonator and can be inferred from appropriate measurements on the qubit alone.
Using estimates for the parameters involved based on a specific realization of
the system we show that it should be possible to carry out this scheme with
existing device technology.

detect variations in optical intensity, distribution, colour, and polarisation.
Polarisation vision systems studied to date detect one to four channels of
linear polarisation, combining them in opponent pairs to provide
intensity-independent operation. Circular polarisation vision has never been
seen, and is widely believed to play no part in animal vision. Polarisation is
fully measured via Stokes' parameters--obtained by combined linear and circular
polarisation measurements. Optimal polarisation vision is the ability to see
Stokes' parameters: here we show that the crustacean \emph{Gonodactylus
smithii} measures the exact components required. This vision provides optimal
contrast-enhancement, and precise determination of polarisation with no
confusion-states or neutral-points--significant advantages. We emphasise that
linear and circular polarisation vision are not different modalities--both are
necessary for optimal polarisation vision, regardless of the presence of
strongly linear or circularly polarised features in the animal's environment.

to the mutliplayer case, while giving a unified perspective for both classical
and quantum games. Considering joint probabilities in the standard
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm (EPR-Bohm) setting for three observers, we use
this setting in order to play general three-player non-cooperative symmetric
games. We analyze how the peculiar non-factorizable joint probabilities
provided by the EPR-Bohm setting can change the outcome of a game, while
requiring that the quantum game attains a classical interpretation for
factorizable joint probabilities. In this framework, our analysis of the
three-player generalized Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) shows that the players can
indeed escape from the classical outcome of the game, because of
non-factorizable joint probabilities that the EPR setting can provide. This
surprising result for three-player PD contrasts strikingly with our earlier
result for two-player PD, played in the same framework, in which even
non-factorizable joint probabilities do not result in escaping from the
classical consequence of the game.

approximation) applied in combination with the Born-Markov approximation
generates a Lindblad type master equation ensuring for completely positive and
stable evolution and is typically well applicable for optical baths. For phonon
baths however, the secular approximation is expected to be invalid. The usual
Markovian master equation does not generally preserve positivity of the density
matrix. As a solution we propose a coarse-graining approach with a dynamically
adapted coarse graining time scale. For some simple examples we demonstrate
that this preserves the accuracy of the integro-differential Born equation. For
large times we analytically show that the secular approximation master equation
is recovered. The method can in principle be extended to systems with a
dynamically changing system Hamiltonian, which is of special interest for
adiabatic quantum computation. We give some numerical examples for the
spin-boson model of cases where a spin system thermalizes rapidly, and other
examples where thermalization is not reached.

use of non zero vectors of a Hilbert space (or, more generally, of one

particular, the question whether such a representation is complete has been
debated since almost the early days of quantum mechanics. In this article, we
develop an alternate way to formalize knowledge about the state of quantum
systems, based solely on experimentally accessible elements, namely on outcomes
of finite measurements. We introduce what we call partial description which,
given a feasible measurement, indicates some outcomes which are known to be
impossible (i.e. known to have a probability equal to 0 to occur) and hence
have to be discarded. Then, we introduce partial states (which are partial
descriptions providing as much information as possible) and compare this way to
describe quantum states to the orthodox one, using vector rays. Finally, we
show that partial states allow to describe quantum states in a strictly more
expressive way that the orthodox description does.

sensory ability of migratory birds to navigate using earths magnetic field,
have been narrowed down to spin-dependent recombination of radical-ion pairs to
be found in avian species retinal proteins. The avian magnetic field detection
is governed by the interplay between magnetic interactions of the radicals
unpaired electrons and the radicals recombination dynamics. Critical to this
mechanism is the long lifetime of the radical-pair spin coherence, so that the
weak geomagnetic field will have a chance to signal its presence. It is here
shown that a fundamental quantum phenomenon, the quantum Zeno effect, is at the
basis of the radical-ion-pair magnetoreception mechanism. The quantum Zeno
effect naturally leads to long spin coherence lifetimes, without any
constraints on the systems physical parameters, ensuring the robustness of this
sensory mechanism. Basic experimental observations regarding avian magnetic
sensitivity are seamlessly derived. These include the magnetic sensitivity
functional window and the heading error of oriented bird ensembles, which so
far evaded theoretical justification. The findings presented here could be
highly relevant to similar mechanisms at work in photosynthetic reactions. They
also trigger fundamental questions about the evolutionary mechanisms that

containing a single two-level atom, is studied over a wide range of detuning
and coupling values. A description of the field in terms of delocalized modes
reveals that the detuning between the atoms and these modes is controlled by
the coupling between the cavities; this detuning in turn governs the nature of
the dynamics. If the atoms are highly detuned from both delocalized field
modes, the dynamics becomes dispersive and an excitation may be transferred
from the first atom to the second without populating the field. In the case of
resonance between the atoms and one of the delocalized modes, state transfer
between the atoms requires intermediate excitation of the field. Thus the
interaction between the two atoms can be controlled by adjusting the coupling
between the cavities.

particle that is believed to transmit the gravitational force at a distance -
the analogue to the photon in electromagnetism. Maybe it is now time to
re-evaluate the status of the gravitation as a fundamental interaction. Here,
we propose a completely new interpretation of gravitation. In this description
the gravitational force is no longer a fundamental force. It is an induced
force, a dispersion force, and the analogue to the Casimir force in
electromagnetism. The fundamental force is in our description a force between
particles with a parabolic interaction potential. In our model the nucleons are
made up from these particles. We find the retarded dispersion force between
these composite particles has the correct distance dependence, 1/r. If this
interpretation is correct it has a broad range of implications. Our view on the
fundamental concept mass is altered; our view on the expansion of the Universe

has polynomial complexity while the best classical factoring algorithms are
sub-exponential, SA is cited as evidence that quantum computers are more
powerful than classical computers. SA is critically dependent on the Quantum
Fourier Transform (QFT) and it is known that the QFT is sensitive to errors in
the quantum state input to it. In this paper, we show that the polynomial
scaling of SA is destroyed by input errors to the QFT part of the algorithm. We
also show that Quantum Error Correcting Codes (QECC) are not capable of
suppressing errors due to operator imprecision and that propagation of operator
precision errors is sufficient to severely degrade the effectiveness of SA.
Additionally we show that operator imprecision in the error correction circuit
for the Calderbank-Shor-Steane QECC is mathematically equivalent to decoherence
on every physical qubit in a register. We conclude that, because of the effect
of operator precision errors, it is likely that physically realizable quantum
computers will be capable of factoring integers no more efficiently than
classical computers.

although the six-state protocol does not. As a result, security proofs for the
BB84 protocol can be based on the assumption that the eavesdropper forwards at
most one photon, while the same does not hold for the six-state protocol.

Feynman's explanation of superfluidity based on Bose statistics as opposed to
BEC, and we present exercises for the students that allow them to arrive at a

connection between classically ordered objects in the thermodynamic limit and
their individual quantum mechanical building blocks is one of the cornerstones
of modern condensed matter theory and has found applications in many different
areas of physics. The theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking however, is
inherently an equilibrium theory, which does not address the dynamics of
quantum systems in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we will use the example of a
particular antiferromagnetic model system to show that the presence of a
so-called thin spectrum of collective excitations with vanishing energy -one of
the well-known characteristic properties shared by all symmetry-breaking
objects- can allow these objects to also spontaneously break time-translation
symmetry in the thermodynamic limit. As a result, that limit is found to be
able, not only to reduce quantum mechanical equilibrium averages to their
classical counterparts, but also to turn individual-state quantum dynamics into
classical physics. In the process, we find that the dynamical description of
spontaneous symmetry breaking can also be used to shed some light on the
possible origins of Born's rule. We conclude by describing an experiment on a
condensate of exciton polaritons which could potentially be used to
experimentally test the proposed mechanism.

We have used the analogy of an early idea \cite{niel1} of visualizing chiral
gauge anomaly as an effect of {\it{spectral flow}} of the energy levels, from
the negative energy Dirac sea, across zero energy level in presence of gauge
interactions. This was extended to conformal anomaly in \cite{fumita}. In the
present work, we exploit the latter formalism in black hole physics where we
interpret crossing the horizon of black hole (the zero energy level) as a
spectral flow since it is also accompanied by a change of sign in the energy of
the particle. Hence in our formulation the negative energy states below horizon
play a similar role as the Dirac sea. We successfully recover the gravitational

mechanics arising naturally from the fundamental principles of the Born
probability rule, superposition, and spacetime translation invariance. The
resulting formalism can be seen as a foundation for a number of previous
parameterized approaches to relativistic quantum mechanics in the literature.
Because time is treated similarly to the three space coordinates, rather than
as an evolution parameter, such approaches have proved particularly useful in
the study of quantum gravity and cosmology. The present paper extends the
foundational spacetime path formalism to include massive, nonscalar particles
of any (integer or half-integer) spin. This is done by generalizing the
principle of translational invariance used in the scalar case to the principle
of full Poincare invariance, leading to a formulation for the nonscalar
propagator in terms of a path integral over the Poincare group. Once the
difficulty of the non-compactness of the component Lorentz group is dealt with,
the subsequent development is remarkably parallel to the scalar case. This
allows the formalism to retain a clear probabilistic interpretation throughout,
with a natural reduction to non-relativistic quantum mechanics closely related
to the well known generalized Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation.

  continuous-variable quantum memory</title><description>  In a recent continuous-variable quantum memory experiment, one quadrature of
light pulse is directly uploaded by the light-atom coupling whereas
complementary quadrature is obtained by homodyne measurement of the out-coupled
light. Subsequently, information from homodyne mea- surement is written into
the memory by feed-back electro-optical control of the atomic state. Using the
same experimental set-up, a deterministic noise excess free record of unknown
quantum states to continuous-variable quantum atomic memory is proposed.
Further, the memory experiment is extended by the pre-squeezing of the recorded
state of light and squeezing post-correction of the recorded state. To upload a
resource to the memory, as single-photon state or superposition of co- herent
states, the post-selection of the measurement results from homodyne detection
is suggested. Then such the probabilistic upload approaches even a lossless
transfer of these highly nonclassical states into the quantum memory.

function collapse is an experimentally testable alternative to non-relativistic
quantum mechanics. In it, collapse occurs because particles interact with a
classical random field. However, particles gain energy from this field, i.e.,
particle energy is not conserved. Recently, it has been shown how to construct
a theory dubbed &quot;completely quantized collapse&quot; (CQC) which is predictively
equivalent to CSL. In CQC, a quantized random field is introduced, and CSL's
classical random field becomes its eigenvalue. In CQC, energy is conserved,
which allows one to understand that energy is conserved in CSL, as the
particle's energy gain is compensated by the random field's energy loss. Since
the random field has energy, it should have gravitational consequences. For
that, one needs to know the random field's energy density. In this paper, it is
shown how to construct a symmetric, conserved, energy-momentum-stress-density
tensor associated with the quantized random field, even though this field obeys
no dynamical equation and has no Lagrangian. Then, three examples are given
involving the random field's energy density. One considers interacting
particles, the second treats a &quot;cosmological&quot; particle creation model, the
third involves the gravity of the random field.

input-output subsystems interconnected by boson field channels carrying quantum
stochastic signals. Generalizing the work of Chebotarev and Gregoratti, we
formulate the model description by prescribing a candidate Hamiltonian for the
network including details the component systems, the field channels, their
interconnections, interactions and any time delays arising from the geometry of
the network. (We show that the candidate is a symmetric operator and proceed
modulo the proof of self-adjointness.) The model is non-Markovian for finite
time delays, but in the limit where these delays vanish we recover a Markov
model and thereby deduce the rules for introducing feedback into arbitrary
quantum networks. The type of feedback considered includes that mediated by the
use of beam splitters. We are therefore able to give a system-theoretic
approach to introducing connections between quantum mechanical state-based
input-output systems, and give a unifying treatment using non-commutative
fractional linear, or Mobius, transformations.

entanglement is a property of the entire multi-qubit system, we argue that
ideal definitions for its characterizing quantities must be
permutation-invariant. Using this criterion, we examine the three 4-qubit
entanglement monotones introduced by Osterloh and Siewert [Phys. Rev. A. 72,
012337]. By expressing them in terms of quantities whose permutational

permutation-invariant. We propose a permutation-invariant entanglement monotone
to replace it, and show that our new monotone properly measures the genuine
4-qubit entanglement in 4-qubit cluster-class states. Our results provide some
useful insights in understanding multipartite entanglement.

magnetic response of the atoms. Current proposals for such systems achieve an
enhancement of the magnetic response by a suitable laser field configuration,
but still rely on high gas densities. Thus further progress is desirable, and
this requires an understanding of the precise mechanism for the enhancement.
Therefore, here we study the magnetic and electric response to a probe field
interacting with three-level atoms in ladder configuration. In our first model,
the three transitions are driven by a control field and the electric and
magnetic component of the probe field, giving rise to a closed interaction
loop. In a reference model, the coherent driving is replaced by an incoherent
pump field. A time-dependent analysis of the closed-loop system enables us to
identify the different contributions to the medium response. A comparison with
the reference system then allows one to identify the physical mechanism that
leads to the enhancement. It is found that the enhancement occurs at so-called
multiphoton resonance by a scattering of the coupling field and the electric
probe field mode into the magnetic probe field mode. Based on these results,
conditions for the enhancement are discussed.

which each pair of entangled particles behaves in the same way, and the
particles in the pair are equivalent, i.e. each of them produces its response
to a measurement according to both local and non-local hidden variables. Their
article aimed at proving that the local hidden variable component in such
models has no effect on the measurement results, i.e. only the non-local

and assumes questionable constraints on the hidden variables. The present text
studies the Colbeck and Renner class of models on a less restrictive case and
under no constraints on the hidden variables. It is shown again that the local

Renner class of models is not the only one possible. A different class is
described, and it admits local hidden variables by the side of the non-local

research and potential applications in quantum optics. Conventionally, it has
become a standard technique to produce the nonclassical light through the
nonlinear optical processes occurring in nonlinear crystals. In this review we
describe using cold atomic-gas media to generate such nonclassical light,
especially focusing on narrow-band biphoton generation. Compared with the
standard procedure, the new biphoton source has such properties as long
coherence time, long coherence length, high spectral brightness, and high
conversion efficiency. In this paper we concentrate on the theoretical aspect
of the entangled two-photon state produced from the four-wave mixing in a
multilevel atomic ensemble. We show that both linear and nonlinear optical
responses to the generated fields play an important role in determining the
biphoton waveform and, consequently on the two-photon temporal correlation.
There are two characteristic regimes determined by whether the linear or
nonlinear coherence time is dominant. In addition, our model provides a clear
physical picture that brings insight into understanding biphoton optics with
this new source. We apply our model to recent work on generating narrow-band
(and even subnatural linewidth) paired photons using the technique of
electromagnetically induced transparency and slow-light effect in cold atoms,
and find good agreements with experimental results.

Clifford algebra formalism we show that arbitrary uniform families of circuits
of these gates, restricted to act only on nearest neighbour (n.n.) qubit lines,
can be classically efficiently simulated. This reproduces a result originally

quantum computation. From this point of view, the gap between efficient
classical and quantum computational power is bridged by a very modest use of a
seemingly innocuous resource (qubit swapping). We also extend the simulation
result above in various ways. In particular, by exploiting properties of
Clifford operations in conjunction with the Jordan-Wigner representation of a
Clifford algebra, we show how one may generalise the simulation result above to
provide further classes of classically efficiently simulatable quantum

only by extremal values of outcomes at each site. We also specify the general

a one-round two-prover quantum interactive proof system for which no finite

sequence of strategies for the provers, with each strategy requiring more

strong analogies between the probabilistic behavior of quantum systems defined
by Hermitian Hamiltonians and the deterministic behavior of classical
mechanical systems extended into the complex domain. Three models are examined:
the quartic double-well potential $V(x)=x^4-5x^2$, the cubic potential
$V(x)=frac{1}{2}x^2-gx^3$, and the periodic potential $V(x)=-\cos x$. For the
quartic potential a wave packet that is initially localized in one side of the
double-well can tunnel to the other side. Complex solutions to the classical
equations of motion exhibit a remarkably analogous behavior. Furthermore,
classical solutions come in two varieties, which resemble the even-parity and
odd-parity quantum-mechanical bound states. For the cubic potential, a quantum
wave packet that is initially in the quadratic portion of the potential near
the origin will tunnel through the barrier and give rise to a probability
current that flows out to infinity. The complex solutions to the corresponding
classical equations of motion exhibit strongly analogous behavior. For the
periodic potential a quantum particle whose energy lies between -1 and 1 can
tunnel repeatedly between adjacent classically allowed regions and thus execute
a localized random walk as it hops from region to region. Furthermore, if the
energy of the quantum particle lies in a conduction band, then the particle
delocalizes and drifts freely through the periodic potential. A classical
particle having complex energy executes a qualitatively analogous local random
walk, and there exists a narrow energy band for which the classical particle
becomes delocalized and moves freely through the potential.

algorithms for the quantum teleportation of an arbitrary N qubit state and
achieve quantum information splitting in all possible ways. With regard to
superdense coding, one can send 2N classical bits by sending only N qubits and
consuming N ebits of entanglement. Explicit comparison of the mirror state with
the rearranged N Bell pairs and the linear cluster states is considered for

characterized with a linear map from the vector

one-bit teleportations in quantum bus computation. We first show a scheme to
perform a universal set of gates on continuous variable modes, which we call a
quantum bus or qubus, using controlled phase-space rotations, homodyne
detection, ancilla qubits and single qubit measurement. The resource usage for
this scheme is lower than any previous scheme to date. We then illustrate how
one-bit teleportations into a qubus can be used to encode qubit states into a
quantum repetition code, which in turn can be used as an efficient method for
producing GHZ states that can be used to create large cluster states. Each of
these schemes can be modified so that teleportation measurements are
post-selected to yield outputs with higher fidelity, without changing the
physical parameters of the system.

states cannot be distilled into pure entanglement. An example is the positive
partial transposition criterion. Here we present, for the first time, the
analogous thing for secret correlations. We introduce a computable criterion
which certifies that a probability distribution between two honest parties and
an eavesdropper cannot be (asymptotically) distilled into a secret key. The
existence of non-distillable correlations with positive secrecy cost, also
known as bound information, is an open question. This criterion may be the key
for finding bound information. However, if it turns out that this criterion
does not detect bound information, then, a very interesting consequence
follows: any distribution with positive secrecy cost can increase the secrecy
content of another distribution. In other words, all correlations with positive
secrecy cost constitute a useful resource.

between a single qubit and its environment, as well as for pairs of qubits
interacting independently with individual environments, using photons obtained
from parametric down-conversion. The qubits are encoded in the polarizations of
single photons, while the interaction with the environment is implemented by
coupling the polarization of each photon with its momentum. A convenient Sagnac
interferometer allows for the implementation of several decoherence channels
and for the continuous monitoring of the environment. For an
initially-entangled photon pair, one observes the vanishing of entanglement
before coherence disappears. For a single qubit interacting with an
environment, the dynamics of complementarity relations connecting single-qubit
properties and its entanglement with the environment is experimentally
determined. The evolution of a single qubit under continuous monitoring of the
environment is investigated, demonstrating that a qubit may decay even when the
environment is found in the unexcited state. This implies that entanglement can
be increased by local continuous monitoring, which is equivalent to
entanglement distillation. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer
of entanglement from the two-qubit system to the two corresponding
environments, between which entanglement may suddenly appear, and show
instances for which no entanglement is created between dephasing environments,
nor between each of them and the corresponding qubit: the initial two-qubit
entanglement gets transformed into legitimate multiqubit entanglement of the
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type.

resulting in a 'freezing' of early quantum nonequilibrium for these particular

quantum mechanics by deriving it from Bohr's doctrine of classical concepts,
translated into the following mathematical statement: a quantum system
described by a noncommutative C*-algebra of observables is empirically
accessible only through associated commutative C*-algebras. The Born
probabilities emerge as the relative frequencies of outcomes in long runs of
measurements on a quantum system; it is not necessary to adopt the frequency
interpretation of single-case probabilities (which will be the subject of a
sequel paper). Our derivation of the Born rule uses ideas from a program begun
by Finkelstein (1965) and Hartle (1968), intending to remove the Born rule as a
separate postulate of quantum mechanics. Mathematically speaking, our approach
refines previous elaborations of this program - notably the one due to Farhi,
Goldstone, and Gutmann (1989) as completed by Van Wesep (2006) - in replacing
infinite tensor products of Hilbert spaces by continuous fields of C*-algebras.
In combination with our interpretational context, this technical improvement
circumvents valid criticisms that earlier derivations of the Born rule have
provoked, especially to the effect that such derivations were mathematically
flawed as well as circular. Furthermore, instead of relying on the
controversial eigenvector-eigenvalue link in quantum theory, our derivation
just assumes that pure states in classical physics have the usual
interpretation as truthmakers that assign sharp values to observables.

this time, the QND detectors act as the role of controlled-not (CNot) gates.
Also they can distinguish the photon number of the spatial modes, which
provides a good way for the next process to purify the entanglement of the
photon pairs kept more. In the second process for entanglement purification,
new QND detectors are designed to act as the role of CNot gates. This protocol
has the advantage of high yield and it requires neither CNot gates based on
linear optical elements nor sophisticated single-photon detectors, which makes
it more convenient in practical applications.

well-studied problems, including classical and quantum communication
complexity, the complexity of simulating distributions arising from bipartite
measurements of shared quantum states, and XOR games. In this model, Alice gets
an input x, Bob gets an input y, and their goal is to each produce an output
a,b distributed according to some pre-specified joint distribution p(a,b|x,y).
  We introduce a new technique based on affine combinations of lower-complexity
distributions. Specifically, we introduce two complexity measures, one which
gives lower bounds on classical communication, and one for quantum
communication. These measures can be expressed as convex optimization problems.
We show that the dual formulations have a striking interpretation, since they
coincide with maximum violations of Bell and Tsirelson inequalities. The dual
expressions are closely related to the winning probability of XOR games. These
lower bounds subsume many known communication complexity lower bound methods,
most notably the recent lower bounds of Linial and Shraibman for the special
case of Boolean functions.
  We show that the gap between the quantum and classical lower bounds is at
most linear in the size of the support of the distribution, and does not depend
on the size of the inputs. This translates into a bound on the gap between
maximal Bell and Tsirelson inequality violations, which was previously known
only for the case of distributions with Boolean outcomes and uniform marginals.
  Finally, we give an exponential upper bound on quantum and classical
communication complexity in the simultaneous messages model, for any
non-signaling distribution. One consequence is a simple proof that any quantum
distribution can be approximated with a constant number of bits of
communication.

of phase of the eigenvectors lead to different metrics. We define a new metric
C_L as a lower bound among the SM quantum informations. We look at properties

When two or more
Bose-Einstein condensates are sent into interferometers, they nevertheless
acquire a relative phase under the effect of quantum measurements. The usual
explanation relies on spontaneous symmetry breaking, where phases are ascribed
to all condensates and treated as unknown classical quantities. However, this
image is not always sufficient: when all particles are measured, quantum
mechanics predicts probabilities that are sometimes in contradiction with it,
as illustrated by quantum violations of local realism. In this letter, we show
that interferometers can be used to demonstrate a large variety of violations

Hidden-variables theories, such as the pilot-wave theory of de Broglie and
Bohm, allow the existence of vacuum states with non-standard field fluctuations
('quantum nonequilibrium'). We show that inflationary expansion can transfer
microscopic nonequilibrium to macroscopic scales, resulting in anomalous power
spectra for the cosmic microwave background. The conclusions depend only weakly

nonequilibrium breaking of scale invariance for the primordial (scalar) power

Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) separability probabilities for two-qubit and qubit-qutrit
(real, complex and quaternionic) systems. An important theoretical concept
employed has been that of a separability function. It appears that if one could
analogously obtain separability functions parameterized by the eigenvalues of
the density matrices in question--rather than the diagonal entries, as
originally used--comparable progress could be achieved in obtaining
separability probabilities based on the broad, interesting class of monotone
metrics (the Bures, being its most prominent [minimal] member). Though
large-scale numerical estimations of such eigenvalue-parameterized functions
have been undertaken, it seems desirable also to study them in
lower-dimensional specialized scenarios in which they can be exactly obtained.
In this regard, we employ an Euler-angle parameterization of SO(4) derived by
S. Cacciatori (reported in an Appendix)--in the manner of the SU(4)-density
matrix parameterization of Tilma, Byrd and Sudarshan. We are, thus, able to
find simple exact separability (inverse-sine-like) functions for two real
two-qubit (rebit) systems, both having three free eigenvalues and one free
Euler angle. We also employ the important Verstraete-Audenaert-de Moor bound to
obtain exact HS probabilities that a generic two-qubit state is absolutely
separable (that is, can not be entangled by unitary transformations). In this
regard, we make copious use of trigonometric identities involving the
tetrahedral dihedral angle arccos(1/3).

  Moreover, this definition of a quantum knot system is intended to represent
the &quot;quantum embodiment&quot; of a closed knotted physical piece of rope. A quantum
knot, as a state of this system, represents the state of such a knotted closed
piece of rope, i.e., the particular spatial configuration of the knot tied in
the rope. Associated with a quantum knot system is a group of unitary
transformations, called the ambient group, which represents all possible ways
of moving the rope around (without cutting the rope, and without letting the
rope pass through itself.)
  Of course, unlike a classical closed piece of rope, a quantum knot can
exhibit non-classical behavior, such as quantum superposition and quantum
entanglement. This raises some interesting and puzzling questions about the
relation between topological and quantum entanglement.
  The knot type of a quantum knot is simply the orbit of the quantum knot under
the action of the ambient group. We investigate quantum observables which are
invariants of quantum knot type. We also study the Hamiltonians associated with
the generators of the ambient group, and briefly look at the quantum tunneling
of overcrossings into undercrossings.
  A basic building block in this paper is a mosaic system which is a formal
(rewriting) system of symbol strings. We conjecture that this formal system
fully captures in an axiomatic way all of the properties of tame knot theory.

  interference</title><description>  We report the results of two experiments performed with two-photon light,
produced via collinear degenerate optical spontaneous parametric downconversion
(SPDC), in which both second-order (one-photon) and fourth-order (two-photon)
interferograms are recorded in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI). In the
first experiment, high-visibility fringes are obtained for both the second- and
fourth-order interferograms. In the second experiment, the MZI is modified by
the removal of a mirror from one of its arms; this leaves the fourth-order
interferogram unchanged, but extinguishes the second-order interferogram. A
theoretical model that takes into consideration both the temporal and spatial
degrees-of-freedom of the two-photon state successfully explains the results.
While the temporal interference in the MZI is independent of the spatial
coherence of the source, that of the modified MZI is not.

the effective Hamiltonian type. The goal is to show that exponential decay and
the golden rule are exact in a suitable scaling limit, and that there is an
associated renormalization group (RG) with these properties as a fixed point.
The method is inspired by a limit theorem for infinitely divisible
distributions in probability theory, where there is a RG with a Cauchy
distribution, i.e. a Lorentz line shape, as a fixed point. Our method of
solving for the spectrum is well known; it does not involve a perturbation
expansion in the interaction, and needs no assumption of a weak interaction. We
use random matrices for the interaction, and show that the ensemble
fluctuations vanish in the scaling limit. Thus the limit is the same for every
model in the ensemble with probability one.

operator whose symbol is the logarithmic characteristic of an infinitely

radiation reaction as a perturbation in line with the reduction of order
procedure. We calculate the contributions to the position shift in the
$\hbar\to 0$ limit of quantum field theory to order $e^2$ in the coupling, the
order of the classical self-force. These calculations contain the emission and
forward scattering one loop processes of quantum electrodynamics. The quantum
calculations are completed for the case of a particle represented by a scalar

using the interpretation of radiation reaction via a Green's function
decomposition, in order to explain and contrast the results achieved.

adopted Unruh-DeWitt type of detector is known to undergo temporary transitions
to excited states even when at rest and in the Minkowski vacuum. We argue that
real detectors do not feature this property, as the configuration &quot;detector in
its ground state + vacuum of the field&quot; is generally a stable bound state of
the underlying fundamental theory (e.g. the ground state-hydrogen atom in a
suitable QED with electrons and protons) in the non-accelerated case. As a
concrete example, we study a local relativistic field theory where a stable
particle can capture a light quantum and form a quasi-stable state. As
expected, to such a stable particle correspond energy eigenstates of the full
theory, as is shown explicitly by using a dressed particle formalism at first

that any pair of authorized sets in an access structure should overlap. From
the viewpoint of application, this places an unnatural constraint on secret
sharing. We present a generalization, called assisted QSS (AQSS), where access
structures without pairwise overlap of authorized sets is permissible, provided
some shares are withheld by the share dealer. We show that no more than
$\lambda-1$ withheld shares are required, where $\lambda$ is the minimum number
of {\em partially linked classes} among the authorized sets for the QSS. Our
result means that such applications of QSS need not be thwarted by the
no-cloning theorem. Secondly, we point out a way of combining the features of
QSS and quantum key distribution (QKD) for applications where a classical
information is shared by quantum means. We observe that in such case, it is

multi-particle interference observable in joint-detection of distant
particle-detectors. Ghost imaging is one of such phenomena. Two types of ghost
imaging have been experimentally demonstrated since 1995. Type-one ghost
imaging uses entangled photon pairs as the light source. The nonlocal
point-to-point image-forming correlation is the result of a
constructive-destructive superposition among a large number of biphoton
amplitudes, a nonclassical entity corresponding to different yet
indistinguishable alternative ways of producing a joint-detction event between
distant photodetectors. Type-two ghost imaging uses chaotic-thermal light. The
type-two image-forming correlation is the result of interferences between
paired two-photon amplitudes, corresponding to two different yet
indistinguishable alternative ways of triggering a join-detection event by two
independent photons. A great deal of confusion about ghost imaging comes from
&quot;ghost shadow&quot;. Similar to x-ray photography, a ghost shadow can be made in
coincidences by &quot;blocking-partial blocking-unblocking&quot; of either co-rotating
laser beams or classically correlated &quot;speckles&quot;. &quot;Ghost shadow&quot; is indeed a
classical phenomenon. The physics of ghost imaging, however, is fundamentally
different. This article is aimed at exploring the nonlocal two-photon
interference nature of ghost imaging.

from the mean of the collective spin operators. This allows the possibility of
efficiently measuring entanglement dynamics in an experimental setting. We
consider a deeply quantum regime and show that signatures of chaos are present
in the dynamical entanglement for parameters accessible in an experiment that
we propose using cold atoms. The evolution of the entanglement depends on the
support of the initial state on regular versus chaotic Floquet eigenstates,
whose phase-space distributions are concentrated on the corresponding regular
or chaotic eigenstructures. We include the effect of decoherence via a
realistic model and show that the signatures of chaos in the entanglement
dynamics persist in the presence of decoherence. In addition, the classical
chaos affects the decoherence rate itself.

Jex and T. Kiss, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{100}, 020501 (2008)] which is based
on a specific measurement scheme. The P\'olya number of a quantum walk depends
in general on the choice of the coin and the initial coin state, in contrast to
classical random walks where the lattice dimension uniquely determines it. We
analyze several examples to depict the variety of possible recurrence
properties. First, we show that for the class of quantum walks driven by
independent coins for all spatial dimensions, the P\'olya number is independent
of the initial conditions and the actual coin operators, thus resembling the
property of the classical walks. We provide an analytical estimation of the
P\'olya number for this class of quantum walks. Second, we examine the 2-D
Grover walk, which exhibits localisation and thus is recurrent, except for a
particular initial state for which the walk is transient. We generalize the
Grover walk to show that one can construct in arbitrary dimensions a quantum
walk which is recurrent. This is in great contrast with the classical walks
which are recurrent only for the dimensions $d=1,2$. Finally, we analyze the
recurrence of the 2-D Fourier walk. This quantum walk is recurrent except for a
two-dimensional subspace of the initial states. We provide an analytical

be simulated by Turing machines; this has naturally led to speculation that
physical systems can also be simulated computationally. But is this wider claim
true, or do behaviours exist which are strictly hypercomputational? Several
idealised computational models are known which suggest the possibility of
hypercomputation, some Newtonian, some based on cosmology, some on quantum

into question the validity of extending CTT to include all physical systems. We
consider the physicality of hypercomputational behaviour from first principles,
by showing that quantum theory can be reformulated in a way that explains why
physical behaviours can be regarded as 'computing something' in the standard
computational state-machine sense. While this does not rule out the physicality
of hypercomputation, it strongly limits the forms it can take. Our model also
has physical consequences; in particular, the continuity of motion and arrow of

the interfering pair of identical pions plays an important role in determining
the characteristics of the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) interference. We study the

which the evolution of the bulk matter is described by relativistic
hydrodynamics while the paths of the two interfering pions by test particles

the effects of secondary pion sources from particle decays, for nuclear
collisions at AGS and RHIC energies. We find that quantum transport of the
interfering pair leads to HBT radii close to those for the chemical freeze-out

the chemical freeze-out configuration. As a consequence, the combined effects
give rise to HBT radii between those extracted from the chemical freeze-out

Its main experimental prediction is violation of Born's rule which provides
only an approximative description of real probabilities. We expect that it will
be possible to design numerous experiments demonstrating violation of Born's
rule. Moreover, recently the first experimental evidence of violation was found
in the triple slits interference experiment, see \cite{WWW}. Although this
experimental test was motivated by another prequantum model, it can be
definitely considered as at least preliminary confirmation of the main
prediction of PCSFT. In our approach quantum particles are just symbolic
representations of &quot;prequantum random fields,&quot; e.g., &quot;electron-field&quot; or
&quot;neutron-field&quot;; photon is associated with classical random electromagnetic
field. Such prequantum fields fluctuate on time and space scales which are
essentially finer than scales of QM, cf. `t Hooft's attempt to go beyond QM
\cite{H1}--\cite{TH2}. In this paper we elaborate a detection model in the
PCSFT-framework. In this model classical random fields (corresponding to
&quot;quantum particles&quot;) interact with detectors inducing probabilities which match
with Born's rule only approximately. Thus QM arises from PCSFT as an
approximative theory. New tests of violation of Born's rule are proposed.

  Quantum Systems</title><description>  The time-evolution of the maximum and the width of exact analytic wave packet
(WP) solutions of the time-dependent Schr\&quot;odinger equation (SE) represents the
particle and wave aspects, respectively, of the quantum system. The dynamics of
the maximum, located at the mean value of position, is governed by the
Newtonian equation of the corresponding classical problem. The width, which is
directly proportional to the position uncertainty, obeys a complex nonlinear
Riccati equation which can be transformed into a real nonlinear Ermakov
equation. The coupled pair of these equations yields a dynamical invariant
which plays a key role in our investigation. It can be expressed in terms of a
complex variable that linearizes the Riccati equation. This variable also
provides the time-dependent parameters that characterize the Green's function,
or Feynman kernel, of the corresponding problem. From there, also the relation
between the classical and quantum dynamics of the systems can be obtained.
Furthermore, the close connection between the Ermakov invariant and the Wigner
function will be shown. Factorization of the dynamical invariant allows for
comparison with creation/annihilation operators and supersymmetry where the
partner potentials fulfil (real) Riccati equations. This provides the link to a
nonlinear formulation of time-independent quantum mechanics in terms of an
Ermakov equation for the amplitude of the stationary state wave functions
combined with a conservation law. Comparison with SUSY and the time-dependent
problems concludes our analysis.

  Functions and CHSH Violations</title><description>  We consider tripartite entangled states for continuous variable systems of
EPR type, which generalise the famous bipartite CV EPR states (eigenvectors of
conjugate choices X1 - X2, P1+ P2, of the systems' relative position and total
momentum variables). We give the regularised forms of such tripartite EPR
states in second-quantised formulation, and derive their Wigner functions. This
is directly compared with the established NOPA-like states from quantum optics.
Whereas the multipartite entangled states of NOPA type have singular Wigner
functions in the limit of large squeezing, r --&gt; infinity, or tanh r --&gt; 1^-
(approaching the EPR states in the bipartite case), our regularised tripartite
EPR states show singular behaviour not only in the approach to the EPR-type
region (s --&gt; 1 in our notation), but also for an additional, auxiliary regime
of the regulator (s --&gt; \sqrt{2}). While the s --&gt;1 limit pertains to
tripartite CV states with singular eigenstates of the relative coordinates and
remaining squeezed in the total momentum, the s --&gt; \sqrt{2} limit yields
singular eigenstates of the total momentum, but squeezed in the relative
coordinates. Regarded as expectation values of displaced parity measurements,
the tripartite Wigner functions provide the ingredients for generalised CHSH
inequalities. Violations of the tripartite CHSH bound (B3 \le 2) are
established, with B3 ~ 2.09 in the canonical regime (s --&gt;1^+), as well as B3 ~
2.32 in the auxiliary regime (s --&gt; \sqrt{2^+}).

then recapitulate as to why the Copenhagen interpretation of the quantum
mechanics had to renounce most of the attractive features of the clasical world
view such as a causal description, locality, scientific realism and introduce a
fundamental distinction between system and apparatus. The crucial role is
played in this by the Bohr's insistence on the wavefunction providing the most
complete description possible for an even individual system. The alternative of
introducing extra dynamical variables, called hidden variables, in addition to
the wavefunction of the system so as to be able to retain at least some of the
desirable features of classical physics, is then explored. The first such
successful attempt was that of Bohm in 1952 who showed that a realistic
interpretation of the quantum mechanics can be given which maintains a causal
description as well as does not treat systems and measuring appeartus
differently. We begin with the construction of the Bohm's theory. He introduces
particle positions as the hidden variables. The particle positions play a
special role in Bohm theory. The particle trajectories are guided by the
wavefunction. The Bohm theory is deterministic. The probability enters through
a special assumption, ``quantum equilibrium'' hypothesis, for the initial
conditions on the ensemble of particle trajectories. The ``wave or particle''
dilemma is resolved by a ``wave and particle'' resolution. The measurements in
Bohm theory can be described without mysticism. Bohm's theory is however
nonlocal.

Einstein, which was based on the philosophy of scientific realism. Special
emphasis is given to the changing status and number of ontological entitities
and arguments for their necessity at any time. Newton, initially, began with
(i) point particles, (ii) aether, (iii) absolute space and (iv) absolute time.
The electromagnetic theory of Maxwell and Faraday introduced `fields' as a new
ontological entity not reducible to earlier ones. Their work also unified
electricity, magnetism and optics. Repeated failure to observe the motion of
earth through aether led Einstein to modify the Newtonian absolute space and
time concepts to a fused Minkowski space-time and the removal of aether from
basic ontological entities in his special theory of relativity. Later Einstein
in his attempts to give a local theory of gravitation was led to further modify
flat Minkowski space-time to the curved Riemannian space time. This reduced
gravitational phenomenon to that of geometry of the space time. Space-time,
matter and fields all became dynamical. We also abstract some general features
of description of nature in classical physics and enquire whether these could
be features of any scientific description?

microscopic timescale of the system and therefore falls outside of the validity
range for conventional approximations of statistical physics. We find that the

such layer when the vortices occupy the sites of a square lattice and have all
the same strength, equal to half of the flux quantum. From this construction we
infer some general characteristics of the spectrum, including the conclusion
that such a flux array produces a repulsive barrier to an incident low-energy
charged particle, so that the penetration probability decays exponentially with
distance from the edge.

encompass macroscopic test masses as the limiting case of large-j spins. The
simulation technique has three stages: first the deliberate introduction of
noise into the simulation, then the conversion of that noise into an equivalent
continuous measurement and control process, and finally, projection of the
trajectory onto a state-space manifold having reduced dimensionality and
possessing a Kahler potential of multi-linear form. The resulting simulation
formalism is used to construct a positive P-representation for the thermal
density matrix. Single-spin detection by magnetic resonance force microscopy

telegraph signal with additive white noise. Larger-scale spin-dust models are
simulated, having no spatial symmetry and no spatial ordering; the

low-dimensionality Kahler state-space manifolds is demonstrated. The

features of entangled system in both pure as well as mixed states level. In the
pure state level, we are largely concerned about the existence and
characteristics of bipartite incomparable pair of states. We have found some
schemes for local transformation of one pure bipartite state to another,
incomparable in nature, by exploiting free unpreserved entanglement. Also, we
observed that different incomparable pair of states in $3\times 3$ may
co-operate with each other to cross the barrier of incomparability. Our next
goal was to probe critically the roots of the existence of incomparable states.
We have succeeded in connecting incomparability with some famous no-go theorems
of quantum mechanics. We have established it with no-flipping principle,
general anti-unitary operators and lastly with inner product preserving
operations. Thus we are able to pose incomparability as a good detector of some
non-physical operations. In the next part, we provide a new class of
multipartite bound entanglement in mixed state level. The class of states are
activable bound entangled. There are exactly four orthogonal activable bound
entangled states in any even number of qubit system. They have some interesting
features like Bell correlation, permutation symmetry, local Pauli connection,
non-compatibility, etc. Apart from those properties, the class of bound
entangled states have the remarkable feature of local indistinguishability in
quantum systems.

refer to an external classical spacetime manifold. Such a reformulation can be
achieved using the language of noncommutative differential geometry. A
consequence which follows is that the `weakly quantum, strongly gravitational'
dynamics of a relativistic particle whose mass is much greater than Planck mass
is dual to the `strongly quantum, weakly gravitational' dynamics of another
particle whose mass is much less than Planck mass. The masses of the two
particles are inversely related to each other, and the product of their masses
is equal to the square of Planck mass. This duality explains the observed value
of the cosmological constant, and also why this value is nonzero but extremely
small in Planck units.

  Atoms in a Dielectric</title><description>  The macroscopic quantum theory of the electromagnetic field in a dielectric
medium interacting with a dense collection of embedded two-level atoms fails to
reproduce a result that is obtained from an application of the classical
Lorentz local-field condition. Specifically, macroscopic quantum
electrodynamics predicts that the Lorentz redshift of the resonance frequency
of the atoms will be enhanced by a factor of the refractive index n of the host
medium. However, an enhancement factor of (n*n+2)/3 is derived using the
Bloembergen procedure in which the classical Lorentz local-field condition is
applied to the optical Bloch equations. Both derivations are short and
uncomplicated and are based on well-established physical theories, yet lead to
contradictory results. Microscopic quantum electrodynamics confirms the
classical local-field-based results. Then the application of macroscopic
quantum electrodynamic theory to embedded atoms is proved false by a specific
example in which both the correspondence principle and microscopic theory of
quantum electrodynamics are violated.

  (i) There is a ball of local operations with shared randomness lying within
the space spanned by the no-signaling operations and centred at the completely
noisy channel.
  (ii) The existence of the ball of local operations with shared randomness is
employed to prove that the weak membership problem for local operations with
shared entanglement is strongly NP-hard.
  (iii) Local operations with shared entanglement are characterized in terms of
linear functionals that are ``completely'' positive on a certain cone K of

appropriate to that cone. Local operations with shared randomness (but not
entanglement) are also characterized in terms of linear functionals that are
merely positive on that same cone K.
  (iv) Existing characterizations of no-signaling operations are generalized to
the multi-party setting and recast in terms of the Choi-Jamiolkowski
representation for quantum super-operators. It is noted that the standard
nonlocal box is an example of a no-signaling operation that is separable, yet

the readout time for ion qubits. PFLs also provide good coherent ion-photon
coupling by matching a large fraction of an ion's emission pattern to a single
optical propagation mode (TEM00). To this end we have optically characterized a
large numerical aperture phase Fresnel lens (NA=0.64) designed for use at 369.5

diffraction-limited spot w0=350+/-15 nm (1/e^2 waist) with mode quality M^2=

expected free space coherent ion-photon coupling to be 0.64%, which is twice
the best previous experimental measurement using a conventional multi-element

elementary features of quantum phenomena, such as the statistical nature of
measurements, complementarity, and global gauge invariance. It is shown that
these features can be traced to experimental observations characteristic of
quantum phenomena and to general theoretical principles, and thus can
reasonably be taken as a starting point of the derivation. When appropriately
formulated within an information geometric framework, these features lead to
(i) the abstract quantum formalism for finite-dimensional quantum systems, (ii)
the result of Wigner's theorem, and (iii) the fundamental correspondence rules
of quantum theory, such as the canonical commutation relationships. The
formalism also comes naturally equipped with a metric (and associated measure)
over the space of pure states which is unitarily- and anti-unitarily invariant.
The derivation suggests that the information geometric framework is directly or
indirectly responsible for many of the central structural features of the
quantum formalism, such as the importance of square-roots of probability and
the occurrence of sinusoidal functions of phases in a pure quantum state.
Global gauge invariance is seen to play a crucial role in the emergence of the

We develop a class of collective states in an ensemble of N spin-1/2 particles

states of the ensemble are preserved. These many-body states, which are
invariant under particle relabeling, can be efficiently simulated since they
span a subspace whose dimension is linear in the number of spins. However, many
open system dynamics break this symmetry, most notably when ensemble members
undergo identical, but local, decoherence. In this paper, we extend the
definition of symmetric collective states of an ensemble of spin-1/2 particles

corresponding collective states span a subspace which grows quadratically with
the number of spins. We also derive explicit formulae for expressing arbitrary

quantum information theory. To this end, we investigate the question of
tripartite entanglement convertibility. We find that there exists no easy
criterion to determine whether a general tripartite transformation can be
performed with a nonzero success probability and in fact, the problem is
NP-hard. Our results are based on the connections between multipartite
entanglement and tensor rank (also called Schmidt rank), a key concept in
algebraic complexity theory. Not only does this relationship allow us to
characterize the general difficulty in determining possible entanglement
transformations, but it also enables us to observe the previously overlooked
fact that {\em the Schmidt rank is not an additive entanglement measure}. As a
result, we improve some best known transformation rates between specific
tripartite entangled states. In addition, we find obtaining the most efficient
algorithm for matrix multiplication to be precisely equivalent to determining
the optimal rate of conversion between the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state

  monogamy, unitary localization, scaling behavior, and molecular sharing
  structure</title><description>  We investigate the structural aspects of genuine multipartite entanglement in
Gaussian states of continuous variable systems. Generalizing the results of
[Adesso &amp; Illuminati, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 150501 (2007)], we analyze whether
the entanglement shared by blocks of modes distributes according to a strong
monogamy law. This property, once established, allows to quantify genuine
N-partite entanglement in terms of the &quot;residual contangle&quot; not encoded into
2,...,K,...,(N-1)-partite quantum correlations. The explicit expression of this
entanglement measure is derived, by a recursive formula, for a subclass of
Gaussian states. These are fully symmetric (permutation-invariant) states
multi-partitioned into blocks, each consisting of an arbitrary number of modes.
We compute the genuine multipartite entanglement shared by the blocks
(&quot;molecules&quot;) and investigate its scaling properties with the number and size
of the molecules, the total number of modes, the global mixedness of the state,
and the squeezed resources. To achieve the exact computation we prove a general
result of symplectic analysis: Correlations among K molecules in N-mode
multi-symmetric Gaussian states can be transformed by a local unitary operation
into correlations shared by K single modes, one per molecule, in effective
non-symmetric states. Due to this theorem, the above results extend to the
subclass of non-symmetric Gaussian states that are obtained by unitarily
localizing the multipartite molecular entanglement of symmetric states. These
findings provide evidence that distributed Gaussian entanglement is strongly
monogamous even beyond specific symmetry constraints, and that the residual
contangle is a bona fide measure of genuine multipartite entanglement for
permutation-invariant Gaussian states under any multi-partition of the modes.

which finds the optimal input signal pulse shape for any given control field,
and a procedure based on the calculation of an optimal control field for any

theoretical predictions for moderate optical depths (&lt;25), while at higher
optical depths the experimental efficiency falls below the theoretically
predicted values. We identify possible effects responsible for this reduction

gas (NIFG) is investigated. Three new classes of parameterized entanglement
witnesses (EWs) are introduced with the aim of detecting genuine tripartite
entanglement in the three-body reduced density matrix and discriminating
between the presence of the two types of genuine tripartite entanglement, W\B
and GHZ\W. By choosing appropriate EW operators, the problem of finding GHZ and
W EWs is reduced to linear programming. Specifically, we devise new W EWs based
on a spin-chain model with periodic boundary conditions, and we construct a
class of parametrized GHZ EWs by linearly combining projection operators
corresponding to all the different state-vector types arising for a
three-fermion system. A third class of EWs is provided by a GHZ stabilizer
operator capable of distinguishing W\B from GHZ\B entanglement, which is not
possible with $W$ EWs. Implementing these classes of EWs, it is found that all
states containing genuine tripartite entanglement are of W type, and hence
states containing GHZ\W genuine tripartite entanglement do not arise. Some
genuine tripartite entangled states that have a positive partial transpose
(PPT) with respect to some bipartition are detected. Finally, it is
demonstrated that a NIFG does not exhibit &quot;pure&quot; W\B genuine tripartite
entanglement: three-party entanglement without any separable or biseparable
admixture does not occur.

  states of neutral atoms</title><description>  A robust system for use of Quantum Computation using neutral atoms is
presented in this communication. This scheme exploits a multilevel atomic
system interacting with two lasers in such a way that it leads to formation of
two Coherent Population Trap (CPT) states. The atomic population can be pumped
alternatively between these two CPT states or any desired superposition of the
two can also be formed. These two CPT states can then be mapped to two Qubits
for Quantum Computation. Preparation of any desired state and formation of CNOT
gates are explained below. A scheme for preparing 1-D lattice of mutually
interacting spin systems, which mimic behaviour of magnetic spin systems is
also shown. Atoms in CPT states do not interact with the lasers that prepare it
and hence are free of perturbation. The states involved here are also made up
of only ground states of bare atoms and hence are free of decoherence due to
spontaneous emission. Thus, the configuration studied here is a good example of
a very robust system.

theory stimulated analysis of proposed computational, cryptographic and

evident that not all mathematical calculations performed in complex Hilbert
space can be directly realized in physical space. Recently by analyzing the
original EPR paper we found that they argument was based on the misuse of the
von Neumann's projection postulate. Opposite to von Neumann, Einstein, Podolsky

with degenerate spectra. It was completely forbidden by von Neumann's
axiomatics of QM. It is impossible to repeat the EPR considerations in the von
Neumann's framework. In this note we analyze quantum teleportation by taking
into account von Neumann's projection postulate. Our analysis shows that so
called quantum teleportation is impossible in von Neumann's framework. On the

to have a building block that produces a considerable amount of entanglement
between on-demand sites through a simple control of a few sites. Here, we
consider permanently-coupled spin networks and study entanglement generation
between qubit pairs to find low-complexity structures capable of generating
considerable entanglement between various qubit pairs. We find that in axially
symmetric networks the generated entanglement between some qubit pairs is
rather larger than generic networks. We show that in uniformly-coupled spin
rings each pair can be considerably entangled through controlling suitable
vertices. To set the location of controlling-vertices, we observe that the
symmetry has to be broken for a definite time. To achieve this, a magnetic flux
can be applied to break symmetry via Aharonov-Bohm effect. Such a set up can
serve as an efficient entanglement distributor bus in which each vertex-pair
can be efficiently entangled through exciting only one fixed vertex and
controlling the evolution time. The low-complexity of this scheme makes it
attractive for use in nanoscale quantum information processors.

finite-state dynamics. This is a familiar viewpoint for workers in quantum
computation, which encompasses classical computation as a special case. Here
this viewpoint is extended to mechanics, where classical dynamics has
traditionally been viewed as a macroscopic approximation of quantum behavior,
not as a special case.
  When a classical dynamics is recast as a special case of quantum dynamics,
the quantum description can be interpreted classically. For example, sometimes
extra information is added to the classical state in order to construct the
quantum description. This extra information is then eliminated by representing
it in a superposition as if it were unknown information about a classical
statistical ensemble. This usage of superposition leads to the appearance of
Fermions in the quantum description of classical lattice-gas dynamics and turns
continuous-space descriptions of finite-state systems into illustrations of
classical sampling theory.
  A direct mapping of classical systems onto quantum systems also allows us to
determine the minimum possible energy scale for a classical dynamics, based on
a localized rate of state change. We use a partitioning description of dynamics
to define locality, and discuss the ideal energy of two model systems.

necessarily globally entangled, while symmetric (bosonic) states are either
globally entangled or fully separable and possess essentially identical states
in all the constituent systems. It is also shown that there cannot exist a
fully separable state which is orthogonal to all symmetric states, and that
full separability of states does not survive under total symmetrization unless
the states are originally symmetric. Besides, anyonic states permitted under

exchange symmetry is actually sufficient for pure states to become globally

concepts and their combinations carry and influence meaning and what this
implies for human thought. More specifically, we examine the use of the
mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics as a modeling instrument and
propose a general mathematical modeling scheme for the combinations of
concepts. We point out that quantum mechanical principles, such as
superposition and interference, are at the origin of specific effects in
cognition related to concept combinations, such as the guppy effect and the
overextension and underextension of membership weights of items. We work out a
concrete quantum mechanical model for a large set of experimental data of
membership weights with overextension and underextension of items with respect
to the conjunction and disjunction of pairs of concepts, and show that no
classical model is possible for these data. We put forward an explanation by
linking the presence of quantum aspects that model concept combinations to the
basic process of concept formation. We investigate the implications of our
quantum modeling scheme for the structure of human thought, and show the
presence of a two-layer structure consisting of a classical logical layer and a
quantum conceptual layer. We consider connections between our findings and
phenomena such as the disjunction effect and the conjunction fallacy in
decision theory, violations of the sure thing principle, and the Allais and
Elsberg paradoxes in economics.

hidden inside of black holes. This is the essence of the weak cosmic censorship
conjecture. The hypothesis, put forward by Penrose 40 years ago, is still one
of the most important open questions in general relativity. In this Letter, we
reanalyze extreme situations which have been considered as counterexamples to
the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. In particular, we consider the
absorption of scalar particles with large angular momentum by a black hole.
Ignoring back reaction effects may lead one to conclude that the incident wave
may overspin the black hole, thereby exposing its inner singularity to distant
observers. However, we show that when back reaction effects are properly taken
into account, the stability of the black-hole event horizon is irrefutable. We
therefore conclude that cosmic censorship is actually respected in this type of
gedanken experiments.

  coordinates</title><description>  A salient feature of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation is that the classical
radial momentum term $p_{r}^{2}$ in polar coordinates is replaced by the
operator $\hat{P}^{\dagger}_{r} \hat{P}_{r}$, where the operator $\hat{P}_{r}$
is not hermitian in general. This fact has important implications for the path
integral and semi-classical approximations. When one defines a formal hermitian
radial momentum operator $\hat{p}_{r}=(1/2)((\frac{\hat{\vec{x}}}{r})
\hat{\vec{p}}+\hat{\vec{p}}(\frac{\hat{\vec{x}}}{r}))$, the relation
$\hat{P}^{\dagger}_{r}
\hat{P}_{r}=\hat{p}_{r}^{2}+\hbar^{2}(d-1)(d-3)/(4r^{2})$ holds in
$d$-dimensional space and this extra potential appears in the path integral
formulated in polar coordinates. The extra potential, which influences the
classical solutions in the semi-classical treatment such as in the analysis of
solitons and collective modes, vanishes for $d=3$ and attractive for $d=2$ and
repulsive for all other cases $d\geq 4$. This extra term induced by the
non-hermitian operator is a purely quantum effect, and it is somewhat analogous
to the quantum anomaly in chiral gauge theory.

investigate the evaluation of its specific heat. A harmonic oscillator bath of
Drude type with cutoff frequency omega_D is employed to model an ohmic friction
force with dissipation strength gamma. Two scenarios for obtaining specific
heat are presented. The first one uses the measurement of the kinetic energy of
the free particle while the second one is based on the reduced partition
function. Both descriptions yield results which are consistent with the Third
Law of thermodynamics. Nevertheless, the two methods produce different results
that disagree even in their leading quantum corrections at high temperatures.
We also consider the regime where the cutoff frequency is smaller than the
friction strength, i.e. omega_D&lt;gamma. There, we encounter puzzling results at
low temperatures where the specific heat based on the thermodynamic
prescription becomes negative. This anomaly is rooted in an ill-defined density
of states of the damped free particle which assumes unphysical negative values
when gamma/omega_D&gt;1.

electromagnetic analog of the boundary conditions in the bag model for hadrons
in QCD. Recent advances and requirements in communication technologies have
attracted great interest in PMC's and Casimir experiments involving structures
that approximate PMC's may be carried out in the not too distant future. In
this paper, we make a study of the zero-temperature PMC Casimir piston in $d+1$

$p+1$-dimensional Dirichlet energies where p ranges from 2 to $d$ inclusively.
We derive two exact $d$-dimensional expressions for the Casimir force on the
piston and find that the force is negative (attractive) in all dimensions. Both
expressions are applied to the case of 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions. A spin-off from
our work is a contribution to the PEC literature: we obtain a useful
alternative expression for the PEC Casimir piston in 3+1 dimensions and also
evaluate the Casimir force per unit area on an infinite strip, a geometry of
experimental interest.

points. The eigenfunctions are then analyzed more precisely in terms of the
associated roots of the Majorana polynomial, leading to exact expressions for
the density of states in the thermodynamic limit. Finite-size effects are also
analyzed, leading in particular to logarithmic corrections near the

preserve the correlation between the measurement results of the legitimate

  application to quantum key distribution</title><description>  There has been considerable interest recently in the generation of azimuthal
phase functions associated with photon orbital angular momentum (OAM) for
high-dimensional quantum key distribution (QKD). The generation of secure
quantum keys requires not only this pure phase basis, but also additional bases
comprised of orthonormal superposition states formed from the pure states.
These bases are also known as mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) and include
quantum states whose wave functions are modulated in both phase and amplitude.
While modulo 2\pi optical path control with high-resolution spatial light
modulators (SLMs) is well suited to creating the azimuthal phases associated
with the pure states, it does not introduce the amplitude modulation associated
with the MUB superposition states. Using computer-generated holography (CGH)
with the Leith-Upatnieks approach to hologram recording however, both phase and
amplitude modulation can be achieved. This paper presents a description of the
OAM states of a 3-dimensional MUB system and analyzes the construction of these
states via CGH with a phase modulating SLM. The effects of phase holography
artifacts on quantum-state generation are quantified and a prescription for
avoiding these artifacts by preconditioning the hologram function is presented.
Practical effects associated with spatially isolating the first-order
diffracted field are also quantified and a demonstration utilizing a liquid

enhanced by the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the quantum data bus. We
consider two external spins simultaneously coupled to a transverse field Ising

coupling between these two spins are obtained. The matrix elements of the
effective Hamiltonian are expressed in terms of dynamical structure factor

of Ising chain and can be calculated numerically by a method introduced in [O.
Derzhko, T. Krokhmalskii, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{56}, 11659 (1997)]. Since all

Using the approach of entanglement of modes across the horizon, we show that
the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to $S_{_{\rm BH}}$ and subleading

ensemble approaches, that the quantum entanglement predicts generic power-law

allowing for off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO). In this paper we describe
the structure of the correlations present in these states when considered in

paired momentum modes is directly related to the ODLRO. Moreover, we

determined by the many-body bath evolution. We develop a cluster-correlation
expansion (CCE) theory for the spin bath dynamics relevant to the qubit
decoherence problem. A cluster correlation term is recursively defined as the
evolution of a group of bath spins divided by the cluster correlations of all
the subgroups. The so-defined correlation accounts for the authentic collective
excitations within a given group. The bath propagator is the product of all
possible cluster correlation terms. For a finite-time evolution as in the qubit
decoherence problem, a convergent result can be obtained by truncating the
expansion up to a certain cluster size. The two-spin cluster truncation of the
CCE corresponds to the pair-correlation approximation [PRB 74,195301(2006)]. In
terms of the standard linked cluster expansion, a cluster correlation term is
the infinite summation of all the connected diagrams with all and only the
spins in the group flip-flopped, and thus the expansion is exact whenever
converges. When the individual contribution of each higher-order correlation
term to the decoherence is small, as the usual case for relatively large baths
where the decoherence could complete well within the bath spin flip-flop time,
the CCE coincides with the cluster expansion [PRB 74,035322(2006)]. For small
baths, however, the qubit decoherence may not complete within the bath spin
flip-flop timescale and thus individual higher-order cluster correlations could
grow significant. In such cases, only the CCE converges to the exact coherent
dynamics of multi-spin clusters. We check the accuracy of the CCE in an exactly
solvable spin-chain model.

waves, i.e., for solutions of the time-independent Schr\&quot;odinger equation at
energy $E$, with applications to the design of ion traps. These are derived
from perfect cloaks for the conductivity and Helmholtz equations, by a
procedure we refer to as isotropic transformation optics. If $W$ is a potential
which is surrounded by a sequence $\{V_n^E\}_{n=1}^\infty$ of approximate
cloaks, then for generic $E$, asymptotically in $n$ (i) $W$ is both
undetectable and unaltered by matter waves originating externally to the cloak;
and (ii) the combined potential $W+V_n^E$ does not perturb waves outside the
cloak. On the other hand, for $E$ near a discrete set of energies, cloaking
{\it per se} fails and the approximate cloaks support wave functions
concentrated, or {\it almost trapped}, inside the cloaked region and negligible
outside. Applications include ion traps, almost invisible to matter waves or
customizable to support almost trapped states of arbitrary multiplicity.
Possible uses include simulation of abstract quantum systems, magnetically
tunable quantum beam switches, and illusions of singular magnetic fields.

oscillator-stabilized flux qubit comprising the CPHASE gate, single-qubit
preparations and measurements. Based on numerical simulations, we argue that
the error rates for these operations can be as low as about .5% and that noise
is highly biased, with phase errors being stronger than all other types of
errors by a factor of nearly 10^3. In contrast, the design of a CNOT gate for
this system with an error rate of less than about 1.2% seems extremely
challenging. We propose a special encoding which exploits the noise bias
allowing us to implement a logical CNOT gate where phase errors and all other
types of errors have nearly balanced rates of about .4%. Our results illustrate
how the design of an encoding scheme can be adjusted and optimized according to
the available physical operations and the particular noise characteristics of
experimental devices.

into account the fact that the quantum entanglement between the degrees of
freedom of a scalar field, traced inside the event horizon, can be the origin
of black hole entropy. The main reason behind such a plausibility is that the
well-known Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area proportionality -- the so-called
`area law' of black hole physics -- holds for entanglement entropy as well,
provided the scalar field is in its ground state, or in other minimum
uncertainty states, such as a generic coherent state or squeezed state.
However, when the field is either in an excited state or in a state which is a
superposition of ground and excited states, a power-law correction to the area
law is shown to exist. Such a correction term falls off with increasing area,
so that eventually the area law is recovered for large enough horizon area. On
ascertaining the location of the microscopic degrees of freedom that lead to
the entanglement entropy of black holes, it is found that although the degrees
of freedom close to the horizon contribute most to the total entropy, the
contributions from those that are far from the horizon are more significant for
excited/superposed states than for the ground state. Thus, the deviations from
the area law for excited/superposed states may, in a way, be attributed to the
far-away degrees of freedom. Finally, taking the scalar field (which is traced
over) to be massive, we explore the changes on the area law due to the mass.
Although most of our computations are done in flat space-time with a
hypothetical spherical region, considered to be the analogue of the horizon, we
show that our results hold as well in curved space-times representing static
asymptotically flat spherical black holes with single horizon.

structure splitting (FSS) must be comparable to the exciton homogeneous line
width. Yet in the (In,Ga)As/GaAs QD, the intrinsic FSS is about a few tens
$\mu$eV. To achieve photon entanglement, it is necessary to Cherry-pick a

strong in-plane magnetic field. Using theoretical modeling of the fundamental
causes of FSS in QDs, we predict that the intrinsic FSS of InAs/InP QDs is an
order of magnitude smaller than that of InAs/GaAs dots, and better yet, their
excitonic gap matches the 1.55 $\mu$m fiber optic wavelength, therefore offer
efficient on-demand entangled photon emitters for long distance quantum

either the initial or final Hamiltonian is a one-dimensional projector
Hamiltonian on the corresponding ground state. The minimum energy gap which
governs the time required for a successful evolution is shown to be
proportional to the overlap of the ground states of the initial and final

partial adiabatic evolution within a narrow interval around the transition

We define the extent, or size $S$ of a superposition, with respect to an
observable \hat{x}, as being the range of outcomes of \hat{x} predicted by that
superposition. Such superpositions are referred to as generalized $S$-scopic
superpositions to distinguish them from the extreme superpositions that
superpose only the two states that have a difference $S$ in their prediction
for the observable. We also consider generalized $S$-scopic superpositions of
coherent states. We explore the constraints that are placed on the statistics
if we suppose a system to be described by mixtures of superpositions that are
restricted in size. In this way we arrive at experimental criteria that are
sufficient to deduce the existence of a generalized $S$-scopic superposition.
The signatures developed are useful where one is able to demonstrate a degree

two coupled quantum--mechanical systems become entangled ? (iii) How does
irreversibility occur in quantum systems with few degrees of freedom ? We embed
these three questions in the broader context of the quantum--classical

matrix theory. Doing so, we propose a novel investigative procedure towards
decoherence and the emergence of classicality out of quantumness in dynamical
systems coupled to external degrees of freedom. We reproduce known results
derived using master equation or Lindblad approaches but also generate novel
ones. In particular we show how local exponential instability also affects the
temporal evolution of quantum chaotic dynamical systems. We extensively rely on
numerical experiments to illustrate our findings and briefly comment on
possible extensions to more complex problems involving environments with $n \gg
1$ interacting dynamical systems, going beyond the uncoupled harmonic
oscillator model of Caldeira and Leggett.

entangling dynamics of the qubits. A recipe for the two-qubit system is
explicitly constructed and the effect of an imperfect fidelity of the

characterized by low photon detection efficiency, while at larger values
two-photon protocols are preferable. We give numerical examples based on

this, we derive the full set of generalized spin squeezing inequalities for the
detection of entanglement. These are inequalities for the mean values and
variances of the collective angular momentum components J_k. They can be used
for the experimental detection of entanglement in a system of spin-1/2
particles in which the spins cannot be individually addressed. We present
various sets of inequalities that can detect all entangled states that can be
detected based on the knowledge of: (i) the mean values and variances of J_k in
three orthogonal directions, or (ii) the variances of J_k in three orthogonal
directions, or (iii) the mean values of J_k^2 in three orthogonal directions or
(iv) the mean values and variances of J_k in arbitrary directions. We compare
our inequalities to known spin squeezing entanglement criteria and discuss to
which extent spin squeezing is related to entanglement in the reduced two-qubit
states. Finally, we apply our criteria for the detection of entanglement in
spin models, showing that they can be used to detect bound entanglement in
these systems.

Various measurement schemes for an optical mode entangled with two spatially

conditional two-qubit entangled states. In particular, generalized measurements
for unambiguous state discrimination enable one to completely eliminate
spin-flip errors in the resulting qubit states, as they would occur in a
homodyne-based scheme due to the finite overlap of the optical states in phase

superconducting single electron resonator (SSET) coupled to a resonator,
focusing on the regime where the SSET is operated in the vicinity of the
Josephson quasiparticle resonance. We consider a range of coupling strengths
and resonator frequencies to reflect the fact that in practice the system can
be tuned to quite a high degree with the resonator formed either by a
nanomechanical oscillator or a superconducting stripline fabricated in close
proximity to the SSET. For very weak couplings the SSET acts on the resonator
like an effective thermal bath. In this regime the current characteristics of
the SSET are only weakly modified by the resonator. Using a mean field
approach, we show that the current noise is nevertheless very sensitive to the
correlations between the resonator and the SSET charge. For stronger couplings,
the SSET can drive the resonator into limit cycle states where self-sustained
oscillation occurs and we find that regions of well-defined bistability exist.
Dynamical transitions into and out of the limit cycle state are marked by
strong fluctuations in the resonator energy, but these fluctuations are
suppressed within the limit cycle state. We find that the current noise of the
SSET is strongly influenced by the fluctuations in the resonator energy and
hence should provide a useful indicator of the resonator's dynamics.

leading to the phenomenon of recoherence. This recoherence effect requires
electrons which are emitted at selected times during the cycle of the excited

manifestation, indeed the epitome, of the very paradoxical and mysterious
nature of quantum theory itself. It is commonly regarded as genuinely quantum
and essentially paradoxical. Although a common approach to teleportation
amongst physicists nowadays is a somewhat operational one, some researchers are
making an effort to deflate the above views.
  On the one hand, it was recently argued that the paradox of information
transfer taking place in teleportation is dissolved (Timpson, 2006) by
appealing the very notion of information. On the other hand, it was
demonstrated that some classical versions of teleportation retain its important
features, which hitherto were considered genuinely quantum (Cohen, 2003;
Collins&amp;Popescu, 2002; Hardy, 1999; Mor, 2006; Spekkens, 2007).
  I will present a special version of a quantum teleportation protocol which is
in a sense split into classical and quantum steps. This description provides us
with a unified picture of teleportation in both domains. It will be explicitly
shown how classical teleportation is embedded in the quantum protocol.
Moreover, the classical step can be successfully accomplished even if the state
shared by the parties is completely disentangled [this is consistent with the
result obtained in (Wang, 2005)]. Yet, all the (apparent) paradoxical features
usually associated with quantum teleportation are clearly present in this step.
In particular, this demonstrates that entanglement cannot be ultimately
responsible and not necessary for the (paradoxical?) information transfer.
  Thus, even if one considers teleportation as mysterious, all its mysteries
are shifted from quantum domain into purely classical one.

Karp-reducible to stoquastic 6-SAT. This result provides the first non-trivial

spinor Bose-Einstein condensate are used as an amplifier of quantum spin
fluctuations. We demonstrate the spectrum of this amplifier to be tunable, in
quantitative agreement with mean-field calculations. We quantify the
microscopic spin fluctuations of the initially paramagnetic condensate by
applying this amplifier and measuring the resulting macroscopic magnetization.
The magnitude of these fluctuations is consistent with predictions of a

shown to be nearly quantum-limited at a gain as high as 30 dB.

quantum-mechanical fluctuations to search for the solution of optimization
problem. It shares the basic idea with quantum adiabatic evolution studied
actively in quantum computation. The present paper reviews the mathematical and
theoretical foundation of quantum annealing. In particular, theorems are
presented for convergence conditions of quantum annealing to the target optimal
state after an infinite-time evolution following the Schroedinger or stochastic
(Monte Carlo) dynamics. It is proved that the same asymptotic behavior of the
control parameter guarantees convergence both for the Schroedinger dynamics and
the stochastic dynamics in spite of the essential difference of these two types
of dynamics. Also described are the prescriptions to reduce errors in the final
approximate solution obtained after a long but finite dynamical evolution of
quantum annealing. It is shown there that we can reduce errors significantly by
an ingenious choice of annealing schedule (time dependence of the control
parameter) without compromising computational complexity qualitatively. A
review is given on the derivation of the convergence condition for classical
simulated annealing from the view point of quantum adiabaticity using a
classical-quantum mapping.

  study of string and Neel correlation functions</title><description>  We derive the dominant contribution to the large-distance decay of
correlation functions for a spin chain model that exhibits both Haldane and
Neel phases in its ground state phase diagram. The analytic results are
obtained by means of an approximate mapping between a spin-1 anisotropic
Hamiltonian onto a fermionic model of noninteracting Bogolioubov quasiparticles
related in turn to the XY spin-1/2 chain in a transverse field. This approach
allows us to express the spin-1 string operators in terms of fermionic
operators so that the dominant contribution to the string correlators at large
distances can be computed using the technique of Toeplitz determinants. As
expected, we find long-range string order both in the longitudinal and in the
transverse channel in the Haldane phase, while in the Neel phase only the
longitudinal order survives. In this way, the long-range string order can be
explicitly related to the components of the magnetization of the XY model.
Moreover, apart from the critical line, where the decay is algebraic, we find
that in the gapped phases the decay is governed by an exponential tail
multiplied by algebraic factors. As regards the usual two points correlation
functions, we show that the longitudinal one behaves in a 'dual' fashion with
respect to the transverse string correlator, namely both the asymptotic values
and the decay laws exchange when the transition line is crossed. For the
transverse spin-spin correlator, we find a finite characteristic length which
is an unexpected feature at the critical point. We also comment briefly the
entanglement features of the original system versus those of the effective
model. The goodness of the approximation and the analytical predictions are
checked versus density-matrix renormalization group calculations.

approximately half of the value of the ground state levels, a g-factor similar

massless spin-1/2 field in a higher-dimensional space-time, induced by a
composite topological defect. The defect is constituted by a global monopole
living on a three-brane and two-dimensional conical space transverse to the
latter. In addition, we assume the presence of an extra magnetic flux along the
core of the conical space. The heat kernel and the Feynman Green function are
presented in the form of a sum of two terms. The first one corresponds to the
contribution coming from the bulk with global monopole in the absence of
conical structure of the orthogonal two-space, and the second one is induced by
this structure and the magnetic flux. We explicitly evaluate the part in the
vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor induced by the flux
carrying conical structure. As in pure cosmic string geometries, only the
fractional part of the ratio of the magnetic flux to flux quantum leads to
non-trivial effects. The vacuum energy-momentum tensor is an even function of
this parameter. We show that for strong gravitational fields corresponding to
large values of the solid angle deficit, the effects induced by the conical
structure and flux are exponentially suppressed.

In order to unveil the increasing of this statistical magnitude with the atomic
number due to the relativistic effects, recently reported in [A. Borgoo, F. De
Proft, P. Geerlings, K.D. Sen, Chem. Phys. Lett., 444 (2007) 186], a new
analytical density to describe neutral atoms is proposed. This density is
inspired in the Tietz potential model. The parameters of this density are
determined from the normalization condition and from a variational calculation
of the energy, which is a functional of the density. The density is
non-singular at the origin and its specific form is selected so as to fit the
results coming from non-relativistic Hartree-Fock calculations. The main
ingredients of the energy functional are the non-relativistic kinetic energy,
the nuclear-electron attraction energy and the classical term of the electron
repulsion. The relativistic correction to the kinetic energy and the Weizsacker
term are also taken into account. The Dirac and the correlation terms are shown
to be less important than the other terms and they have been discarded in this
study. When the statistical measure of complexity is calculated in position
space with the analytical density derived from this model, the increasing trend
of this magnitude as the atomic number increases is also found.

that Maxwell's equations in the absence of free charges satisfy duality
invariance on an operator level, whereas this is not true for Lorentz forces

Casimir forces, local-field corrected decay rates as well as van-der-Waals
potentials are invariant with respect to a global exchange of electric and
magnetic quantities. This exact symmetry can be used to deduce the physics of
new configurations on the basis of already established ones.

the controversial or mysterious aspects of the vacuum energy of quantum fields.
This paper is a thorough study of the two-dimensional scalar field in a
rectangle by the method of images, or closed classical (or optical) paths,
which is exact in this case. For each point r and each specularly reflecting
path beginning and ending at r, we provide formulas for all components of the
stress tensor T_{\mu\nu}(r), for all values of the curvature coupling constant
\xi and all values of an ultraviolet cutoff parameter. Arbitrary combinations
of Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the four sides can be treated. The total
energy is also investigated, path by path. These results are used in an attempt
to clarify the physical reality of the repulsive (outward) force on the sides
of the box predicted by calculations that neglect both boundary divergences and
the exterior of the box. Previous authors have studied &quot;piston&quot; geometries that
avoid these problems and have found the force to be attractive. We consider a
&quot;pistol&quot; geometry that comes closer to the original problem of a box with a
movable lid. We find again an attractive force, although its origin and
detailed behavior are somewhat different from the piston case. However, the
pistol (and the piston) model can be criticized for extending idealized
boundary conditions into short distances where they are physically implausible.
Therefore, it is of interest to see whether leaving the ultraviolet cutoff
finite yields results that are more plausible. We then find that the force
depends strongly on a geometrical parameter; it can be made repulsive, but only
by forcing that parameter into the regime where the model is least convincing
physically.

pair of modes (electrons coupled through the eta-pairing mechanism). We first
detect the two/multi-partite nature of each quantum phase transition by a
comparative study of the singularities of Von Neumann entropy and quantum
mutual information. We establish the existing relations between the
correlations in the momentum representation and those exhibited in the
complementary picture: the direct lattice representation. The presence of
multipartite entanglement is then investigated in detail through the Q-measure,
namely a generalization of the Meyer-Wallach measure of entanglement. Such a

increasing the size of the reduced density matrix. In momentum space, we

an atomic beam works as a reservoir for the radiation field trapped inside the

&quot;positive charge cloud&quot; size in the Hydrogen ground state is much larger than
the proper proton size. It is even bigger for the target atoms in excited
initial states. The elastic scattering at large angles is generally weaker than
the Rutherford one since the effective potential at short distances is softer

scattering leads to the target atom excitations due to pushing the nucleus (=&gt;

programming language QML. The syntax of this language is defined and explained,
along with a new QML definition of the quantum teleport algorithm. The
categorical operational semantics of QML is also briefly introduced, in the
form of annotated quantum circuits. This definition leads to a denotational
semantics, given in terms of superoperators. Finally, an implementation in
Haskell of the semantics for QML is presented as a compiler. The compiler takes
QML programs as input, which are parsed into a Haskell datatype. The output
from the compiler is either a quantum circuit (operational), an isometry (pure
denotational) or a superoperator (impure denotational). Orthogonality
judgements and problems with coproducts in QML are also discussed.

survival amplitude of an unstable state in the long time region: In 1957
Khalfin proved that this amplitude tends to zero as $t$ goes to the infinity
more slowly than any exponential function of $t$. This effect can be described
in terms of time-dependent decay rate $\gamma(t)$ and then the Khalfin result
means that this $\gamma(t)$ is not a constant for long times but that it tends
to zero as $t$ goes to the infinity. It appears that a similar conclusion can
be drawn for the energy of the unstable state for a large class of models of
unstable particles: This energy should be much smaller for suitably long times
$t$ than the energy of this state for $t$ of the order of the lifetime of the
considered state. Within a given model we show that the energy corrections in
the long ($t \to \infty$) and relatively short (lifetime of the state) time
regions, are different. It is shown that these corrections decrease to ${\cal
E} = {\cal E}_{min} &lt; {\cal E}_{\phi}$ as $t \to \infty$, where ${\cal
E}_{\phi}$ is the energy of the system in the state $|\phi&gt;$ measured at times
$t \sim \tau_{\phi}= \frac{\hbar}{\gamma}$. This is a purely quantum mechanical
effect. It is hypothesized that there is a possibility to detect this effect by
analyzing the spectra of distant astrophysical objects. The above property of
unstable states may influence the measured values of astrophysical and
cosmological parameters.

information carriers. Here we present an experimental demonstration of a robust
distribution scheme in which one photon of an entangled photon pair is
successfully encoded into and decoded from a decoherence-free subspace (DFS) by
a state-independent scheme. We achieved a high-fidelity distribution of the

the scheme is robust against fragility of the reference frame. The scheme,
thanks to its state-independence, is also applicable to multipartite case where
the photon to be distributed is entangled with many other photons. Such a

  relations</title><description>  We define a diagonal entropy (d-entropy) for an arbitrary Hamiltonian system
as $S_d=-\sum_n \rho_{nn}\ln \rho_{nn}$ with the sum taken over the basis of
instantaneous energy states. In equilibrium this entropy coincides with the
conventional von Neumann entropy $S_n=-{\rm Tr}\, \rho\ln\rho$. However, in
contrast to $S_n$, the d-entropy is not conserved in time in closed Hamiltonian
systems. If the system is initially in stationary state then in accord with the
second law of thermodynamics the d-entropy can only increase or stay the same.
We also show that the d-entropy can be expressed through the energy
distribution function and thus it is measurable, at least in principle. Under
very generic assumptions of the locality of the Hamiltonian and
non-integrability the d-entropy becomes a unique function of the average energy
in large systems and automatically satisfies the fundamental thermodynamic
relation. This relation reduces to the first law of thermodynamics for
quasi-static processes. The d-entropy is also automatically conserved for
adiabatic processes. We illustrate our results with explicit examples and show
that $S_d$ behaves consistently with expectations from thermodynamics.

vacuum fluctuations of matter fields and critically assess the usual assertion
that vacuum energy implies a Planckian cosmological constant. A new stochastic
classical approach to the quantum fluctuations of spacetime is developed. The
work extends conceptually Boyer's random electrodynamics to a theory of random
gravity but has a considerably richer structure for inheriting nonlinearity
from general relativity. Attention is drawn to subtleties in choosing boundary
conditions for metric fluctuations in relation to their dynamical consequences.
Those compatible with the observed Lorentz invariance must allow for
spontaneous conformal fluctuations, in addition to stochastic gravitational
waves due to zero point gravitons. This is implemented through an effective
metric defined in terms of the random spacetime metric modulo a fluctuating
conformal factor. It satisfies an effective Einstein equation coupled to an
effective stress-energy tensor incorporating gravitational self energy of
metric fluctuations as well as matter fields. The effective Einstein equation
is expanded up to second order nonlinearity. A UV-cutoff is introduced whose
specific value, however, does not enter into the resulting description of
random gravity. The averaged effective metric satisfies the empty space
Einstein equation with an effective cosmological constant. This vanishes when
only the massless matter fields are included. More generally, a finite
effective cosmological constant compatible with the observational constraints
can be obtained as long as the bare masses of the massive matter fields are
nearly zero, or the conformal invariance of matter is restored at some high
energy scale.

  classical limit: the case of the square billiard</title><description>  Square billiards are quantum systems complying with the dynamical
quantum-classical correspondence. Hence an initially localized wavefunction
launched along a classical periodic orbit evolves along that orbit, the
spreading of the quantum amplitude being controlled by the spread of the
corresponding classical statistical distribution. We investigate wavepacket
dynamics and compute the corresponding de Broglie-Bohm trajectories in the
quantum square billiard. We also determine the trajectories and statistical
distribution dynamics for the equivalent classical billiard. Individual Bohmian
trajectories follow the streamlines of the probability flow and are generically
non-classical. This can also hold even for short times, when the wavepacket is
still localized along a classical trajectory. This generic feature of Bohmian
trajectories is expected to hold in the classical limit. We further argue that
in this context decoherence cannot constitute a viable solution in order to
recover classicality.

univariate functions of some special relevant variable--which we hypothesize to

black-box function f on the graph's vertices, this is the problem of
determining a local minimum of f--a vertex v for which f(v) is no more than f
evaluated at any of v's neighbors. In 1983, Aldous gave the first strong lower
bounds for the problem, showing that any randomized algorithm requires
$\Omega(2^{n/2 - o(1)})$ queries to determine a local minima on the
n-dimensional hypercube. The next major step forward was not until 2004 when
Aaronson, introducing a new method for query complexity bounds, both
strengthened this lower bound to $\Omega(2^{n/2}/n^2)$ and gave an analogous
lower bound on the quantum query complexity. While these bounds are very
strong, they are known only for narrow families of graphs (hypercubes and
grids). We show how to generalize Aaronson's techniques in order to give
randomized (and quantum) lower bounds on the query complexity of local search
for the family of vertex-transitive graphs. In particular, we show that for any
vertex-transitive graph G of N vertices and diameter d, the randomized and

does not involve measurements of quadratures - which is typically very
challenging for atomic modes - it renders the detection of atomic many-particle

a class of reducible representations of CCR. $A_a(x)$ transforms as a Hermitian
four-vector field in Minkowski four-position space (no change of gauge), but in
momentum space it splits into spin-1 massless photons (optics) and two massless
scalars (similar to dark matter). Unitary dynamics is given by point-form
interaction picture, with minimal-coupling Hamiltonian constructed from fields
that are free on the null-cone boundary of the Milne universe. SL(2,C)
transformations and dynamics are represented unitarily in positive-norm Hilbert
space describing $N$ four-dimensional oscillators. Vacuum is a Bose-Einstein
condensate of the $N$-oscillator gas. Both the form of $A_a(x)$ and its
transformation properties are determined by an analogue of the twistor
equation. The same equation guarantees that the subspace of vacuum states is,
as a whole, Poincar\'e invariant. The formalism is tested on quantum fields
produced by pointlike classical sources. Photon statistics is well defined even
for pointlike charges, with UV/IR regularizations occurring automatically as a
consequence of the formalism. The probabilities are not Poissonian but of a
R\'enyi type with $\alpha=1-1/N$. The average number of photons occurring in
Bremsstrahlung splits into two parts: The one due to acceleration, and the one
that remains nonzero even if motion is inertial. Classical Maxwell
electrodynamics is reconstructed from coherent-state averaged solutions of
Heisenberg equations. Static pointlike charges polarize vacuum and produce
effective charge densities and fields whose form is sensitive to both the
choice of representation of CCR and the corresponding vacuum state.

resonantly, is presented as a natural way to spectrally isolate the photons of
interest from the original driving field. We go on to demonstrate that the
relative frequencies of the two spin-tagged photon states are tuned independent

induced by the very same driving laser. This demonstration enables the
realization of challenging QIS proposals such as heralded single photon

splitting in the ground and excited states independently, thus enabling

  vicinity of diabolic and exceptional points</title><description>  We consider the geometric phase and quantum tunneling in vicinity of diabolic
and exceptional points. We show that the geometric phase associated with the
degeneracy points is defined by the flux of complex magnetic monopole. In
weak-coupling limit the leading contribution to the real part of geometric
phase is given by the flux of the Dirac monopole plus quadrupole term, and the
expansion for its imaginary part starts with the dipolelike field. For a
two-level system governed by the generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we derive a
formula to compute the non-adiabatic complex geometric phase by integral over
the complex Bloch sphere. We apply our results to to study a two-level
dissipative system driven by periodic electromagnetic field and show that in
the vicinity of the exceptional point the complex geometric phase behaves as
step-like function. Studying tunneling process near and at exceptional point,
we find two different regimes: coherent and incoherent. The coherent regime is
characterized by the Rabi oscillations and one-sheeted hyperbolic monopole
emerges in this region of the parameters. In turn with the incoherent regime
the two-sheeted hyperbolic monopole is associated. The exceptional point is the
critical point of the system where the topological transition occurs and both
of the regimes yield the quadratic dependence on time. We show that the
dissipation brings into existence of pulses in the complex geometric phase and
the pulses are disappeared when dissipation dies out. Such a strong coupling
effect of the environment is beyond of the conventional adiabatic treatment of
the Berry phase.

a bath of N spin-1/2 particles is studied in the thermodynamic limit. The
interaction between the spins is Heisenberg XY type and the bath is considered
to be a perfect thermal reservoir. In this case, the evolution of the
populations of the reduced density matrix are obtained for different
temperatures. A Born approximation is made but not a Markov approximation
resulting a non-Markovian dynamics. The measure of the way that the system
mixes is obtained by means of the von Neumann entropy. For low temperatures,
results show that there are oscillations of populations and of the von Neumann
entropy, indicating that the central spin becomes a pure state with
characteristic time periods in which it is possible to extract or recuperate
information. In the regime of high temperatures, the evolution shows a final
maximum mixed state with entropy S=ln 2 as it is expected for a two level

the time-periodic harmonic or inverted-harmonic potential. A formally exact
solution of the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation is constructed, which
describes the matter shock waves with chaotic or periodic amplitudes and
phases. When the periodic driving is switched off and the number of condensed
atoms is conserved, we obtained the exact stationary states and non-stationary
states. The former contains the stable non-propagated shock wave, and in the
latter the shock wave alternately collapses and grows for the harmonic trapping

antitrapping. It is revealed that existence of chaos play a role for
suppressing the blast of matter wave. The results suggest a method for
preparing the exponentially accelerated BEC shock waves or the stable

Kinetic energy
is a non-zero positive value in many cases of bound states, when a wave
function is a real-valued one and there are no visible motion and flux. This
can be understood, using expansion of the wave function into Fourier integral,
that is, on the basis of virtual plane waves. The ground state energy of a
hydrogen atom is calculated in a special way, regarding explicitly all the
terms of electrostatic and kinetic energies. The correct values of the ground
state energy and the radius of decay are achieved only when the electrostatic
energies of the electron and the proton (self-energies) are not taken into
account. This proves again that self-action should be excluded in quantum
mechanics. A model of a spherical ball with uniformly distributed charge of
particles is considered. It is shown that for a neutral ball (with compensated
electric charge) the electrostatic energy is a non-zero negative value in this
model. This occurs because the self-energy of the constituting particles should
be subtracted. So it shown that the energy of the electric field does not have
to be of a positive value in any imaginable problem.

quantum ratchet acceleration with full classical chaos [Gong and Brumer, Phys.
Rev. Lett. 97, 240602 (2006)] constitutes a new element of quantum chaos and an
interesting violation of a sum rule of classical ratchet transport. Here we
propose a simple quantum ratchet accelerator model that can also generate
linearly increasing quantum current with full classical chaos. This new model
does not require a bichromatic lattice potential. It is based on a variant of
an on-resonance kicked-rotor system, periodically kicked by two optical lattice
potentials of the same lattice constant, but with unequal amplitudes and a
fixed phase shift between them. The dependence of the ratchet current
acceleration rate on the system parameters is studied in detail. The cold-atom
version of our new quantum ratchet accelerator model should be realizable by
introducing slight modifications to current cold-atom experiments.

This effect is reflected in quantum diffraction patterns with large

naturally include (multipartite) entanglement and braiding. In particular,
q-deformed spin network automata are able to perform efficiently approximate
calculations of topological invarians of knots and 3-manifolds. The same
algebraic background is shared by 2D lattice models supporting topological
phases of matter that have recently gained much interest in condensed matter
physics. These developments are motivated by the possibility to store quantum
information fault-tolerantly in a physical system supporting fractional
statistics since a part of the associated Hilbert space is insensitive to local
perturbations. Most of currently addressed approaches are framed within a
'double' quantum Chern-Simons field theory, whose quantum amplitudes represent
evolution histories of local lattice degrees of freedom.
  We propose here a novel combinatorial approach based on `state sum' models of
the Turaev-Viro type associated with SU(2)_q-colored triangulations of the
ambient 3-manifolds. We argue that boundary 2D lattice models (as well as
observables in the form of colored graphs satisfying braiding relations) could
be consistently addressed. This is supported by the proof that the Hamiltonian
of the Levin-Wen condensed string net model in a surface Sigma coincides with
the corresponding Turaev-Viro amplitude on Sigma x [0,1] presented in the last

frequency co-propagate in the fibre, their different phase velocities cause a
stationary interference pattern to establish. Intensity minima of the
evanescent field at any distance from the fibre surface can be created and an
array of optical microtraps can thus be obtained in the evanescent field. We
discuss three possible combinations of the lowest order modes, yielding traps
at one to two hundred nanometres from the fibre surface which, using a few ten
milliwatts of trapping laser power, have a depth on the order of 1 mK for
caesium atoms and a trapping lifetime exceeding 100 seconds. The resulting
trapping geometry is of particular interest because atoms in such microtrap
arrays will be coupled to any additional field propagating in the fibre via the
evanescent field, thereby realising ensembles of fibre-coupled atoms.

Understanding the power of MIPs in the quantum context raises many open
problems, as there are several interesting models to consider. For example, one
can study the question when the provers share entanglement or not, and the
communication between the verifier and the provers is quantum or classical.
While there are several partial results on the subject, so far no one presented
an efficient scheme for recognizing NEXP (or NP with logarithmic
communication), except for [KM03], in the case there is no entanglement (and of
course no communication between the provers). We introduce another variant of
Quantum MIP, where the provers do not share entanglement, the communication
between the verifier and the provers is quantum, but the provers are unlimited
in the classical communication between them. At first, this model may seem very
weak, as provers who exchange information seem to be equivalent in power to a
simple prover. This in fact is not the case - we show that any language in NEXP
can be recognized in this model efficiently, with just two provers and two
rounds of communication, with a constant completeness-soundness gap.

potentially fast dephasing times of spins in the solid state [1-3], spin
control operating on the picosecond or faster timescale may be necessary. Such
speeds, which are not possible to attain with standard electron spin resonance
(ESR) techniques based on microwave sources, can be attained with broadband
optical pulses. One promising ultrafast technique utilizes single broadband
pulses detuned from resonance in a three-level Lambda system [4]. This
attractive technique is robust against optical pulse imperfections and does not
require a fixed optical reference phase. Here we demonstrate the principle of
coherent manipulation of spins theoretically and experimentally. Using this
technique, donor-bound electron spin rotations with single-pulse areas
exceeding pi/4 and two-pulses areas exceeding pi/2 are demonstrated. We believe
the maximum pulse areas attained do not reflect a fundamental limit of the

This technique has applications from basic solid-state ESR spectroscopy to
arbitrary single-qubit rotations [4, 5] and bang-bang control[6] for quantum

  system</title><description>  Chip-based cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) devices consisting of a
self-assembled InAs quantum dot (QD) coupled to a high quality factor GaAs
microdisk cavity are coherently probed through their optical channel using a
fiber taper waveguide. We highlight one particularly important aspect of this
all-fiber measurement setup, which is the accuracy to which the optical
coupling level and optical losses are known relative to typical free-space
excitation techniques. This allows for precise knowledge of the intracavity
photon number and measurement of absolute transmitted and reflected signals.
Resonant optical spectroscopy of the system under both weak and strong driving
conditions are presented, which when compared with a quantum master equation
model of the system allows for determination of the coherent coupling rate
between QD exciton and optical cavity mode, the different levels of elastic and
inelastic dephasing of the exciton state, and the position and orientation of
the QD within the cavity. Pump-probe measurements are also performed in which a
far off-resonant red-detuned control laser beam is introduced into the cavity.
Rather than producing a measurable ac-Stark shift in the exciton line of the
QD, we find that this control beam induces a saturation of the resonant system
response. The broad photoluminescence spectrum resulting from the presence of
the control beam in the cavity points to sub-bandgap absorption in the
semiconductor, and the resulting free-carrier generation, as the likely source
of system saturation.

The measurements do not have to be tomographically complete, and may consist of
POVMs rather than von Neumann measurements. One obtains a probability that
one's state is entangled and an estimate of any desired entanglement measure,
including their error bars. As an example we consider (tomographically
incomplete) spin correlation measurements on both 2-qubit and 3-qubit states.
As byproducts we obtain estimates of the volume of entangled states vs. states
that violate a given Bell inequality for both pure and mixed states, and an

as a nonlinear, current dependent inductance, inducing an external flux
tunable, nonlinear Duffing self-interaction term in the microwave resonator

inductively through changes in the external flux threading SQUID loop, giving a

enables a closer approach to the displacement detection standard quantum limit,

quantum computing or quantum communication device. This theory forms the
cornerstone of practical quantum information theory. We provide several
contributions to the theory of quantum error correction--mainly to the theory
of &quot;entanglement-assisted&quot; quantum error correction where the sender and
receiver share entanglement in the form of entangled bits (ebits) before
quantum communication begins. Our first contribution is an algorithm for
encoding and decoding an entanglement-assisted quantum block code. We then give
several formulas that determine the optimal number of ebits for an
entanglement-assisted code. The major contribution of this thesis is the
development of the theory of entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional
coding. A convolutional code is one that has memory and acts on an incoming
stream of qubits. We explicitly show how to encode and decode a stream of
information qubits with the help of ancilla qubits and ebits. Our
entanglement-assisted convolutional codes include those with a
Calderbank-Shor-Steane structure and those with a more general structure. We
then formulate convolutional protocols that correct errors in noisy
entanglement. Our final contribution is a unification of the theory of quantum
error correction--these unified convolutional codes exploit all of the known
resources for quantum redundancy.

As opposed to Kullback divergence it determines in a very direct way a metric;
indeed, it is the square of a metric. We consider a family of divergence
measures (JD_alpha for alpha&gt;0), the Jensen divergences of order alpha, which
generalize JD as JD_1=JD. Using a result of Schoenberg, we prove that JD_alpha
is the square of a metric for alpha lies in the interval (0,2], and that the
resulting metric space of probability distributions can be isometrically
embedded in a real Hilbert space. Quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence (QJD) is a
symmetrized and smoothed version of quantum relative entropy and can be
extended to a family of quantum Jensen divergences of order alpha (QJD_alpha).
We strengthen results by Lamberti et al. by proving that for qubits and pure
states, QJD_alpha^1/2 is a metric space which can be isometrically embedded in
a real Hilbert space when alpha lies in the interval (0,2]. In analogy with
Burbea and Rao's generalization of JD, we also define general QJD by
associating a Jensen-type quantity to any weighted family of states.
Appropriate interpretations of quantities introduced are discussed and bounds

optics and in phenomenological models of linear quantum circuits. In
particular, such a theory will enable the systematic realization of
coherent/fully quantum linear stochastic controllers for quantum control,
amongst other potential applications. We show how general linear dynamical
quantum stochastic systems can be constructed by assembling an appropriate
interconnection of one degree of freedom open quantum harmonic oscillators and,
in the quantum optics setting, discuss how such a network of oscillators can be
approximately synthesized or implemented in a systematic way from some linear
and non-linear quantum optical elements. An example is also provided to
illustrate the theory.

  One Instant?</title><description>  In Bohmian mechanics, a version of quantum mechanics that ascribes world
lines to electrons, we can meaningfully ask about an electron's instantaneous
speed relative to a given inertial frame. Interestingly, according to the
relativistic version of Bohmian mechanics using the Dirac equation, a massive
particle's speed is less than or equal to the speed of light, but not
necessarily less. That is, there are situations in which the particle actually
reaches the speed of light---a very non-classical behavior. That leads us to
the question of whether such situations can be arranged experimentally. We
prove a theorem, Theorem 5, implying that for generic initial wave functions
the probability that the particle ever reaches the speed of light, even if at
only one point in time, is zero. We conclude that the answer to the question is
no. Since a trajectory reaches the speed of light whenever the quantum
probability current psi-bar gamma^mu psi is a lightlike 4-vector, our analysis
concerns the current vector field of a generic wave function and may thus be of
interest also independently of Bohmian mechanics. The fact that the current is
never spacelike has been used to argue against the possibility of
faster-than-light tunnelling through a barrier, a somewhat similar question.
Theorem 5, as well as a more general version provided by Theorem 6, are also
interesting in their own right. They concern a certain property of a function
psi: R^4 --&gt; C^4 that is crucial to the question of reaching the speed of
light, namely being transverse to a certain submanifold of C^4 along a given
compact subset of space-time. While it follows from the known transversality
theorem of differential topology that this property is generic among smooth
functions psi: R^4 --&gt; C^4, Theorem 5 asserts that it is also generic among
smooth solutions of the Dirac equation.

Here, generalizing this method, a condition is derived, under which the
corresponding flow of a quantum state becomes geodesic in a submanifold of the
projective Hilbert space, independently of specific initial conditions. This
implies the geometric optimality of the present method as an algorithm of
generating stationary states. The result is illustrated by analyzing some

classical fluid dynamics. In particular it is well known the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger
equation can be viewed as describing a classical compressible and non-viscous
fluid, described by two (quantum) fluid fields ${\rho ,% \mathbf{V}} $, to be
identified with the quantum probability density and velocity field. This
feature has suggested the construction of a phase-space hidden-variable
description based on a suitable inverse kinetic theory (IKT; Tessarotto et al.,
2007). The discovery of this approach has potentially important consequences
since it permits to identify the classical dynamical system which advances in
time the quantum fluid fields. This type of approach, however requires the
identification of additional fluid fields. These can be generally identified
with suitable directional fluid temperatures $T_{QM,i}$ (for $i=1,2,3$), to be
related to the expectation values of momentum fluctuations appearing in the
Heisenberg inequalities. Nevertheless the definition given previously for them
(Tessarotto et al., 2007) is non-unique. In this paper we intend to propose a
criterion, based on the validity of a constant H-theorem, which provides an
unique definition for the quantum temperatures.

with optical axes parallel to the plate boundaries [Izv. Vyssh. Uchebn.\
Zaved., Radiofiz., {\bf 12}, 1637 (1978)]. The interesting new feature of the
solution compared to the case of isotropic plates is the existence of a Casimir
torque which acts to line up the optical axes if they are not parallel or
perpendicular. The forces were found from a calculation of the Helmholtz free
energy of the electromagnetic field. Given the length of the calculations in
this problem and hopes of an experimental measurement of the torque, it is
important to check the results for the Casimir forces by a different method. We
provide this check by calculating the electromagnetic stress tensor between the
plates and showing that the resulting forces are in agreement with those found
by Barash.

  quantum network</title><description>  In this paper, we consider a linear quantum network composed of two distantly
separated cavities that are connected via a one-way optical field. When one of
the cavity is damped and the other is undamped, the overall cavity state
obtains a large amount of entanglement in its quadratures. This entanglement
however immediately decays and vanishes in a finite time. That is, entanglement
sudden-death occurs. We show that the direct measurement feedback method
proposed by Wiseman can avoid this entanglement sudden-death, and further,
enhance the entanglement. It is also shown that the entangled state under
feedback control is robust against signal loss in a realistic detector,
indicating the reliability of the proposed direct feedback method in practical
situations.

system including the reference system (RS), with respect to which the total
system is described. The RS is assumed to be able to act as a measuring
apparatus, with measurement records given by the values of some reference
properties of the RS. In order to describe the total system, we define a frame
of reference (FR) as a set of states that can be used to express all other
states of the total system. The theory is based on four basic postulates, which
have, loosely speaking, the following contents. (i) A reference property of a
RS has a definite value and is sufficiently stable in the FR directly related
to the reference property. (ii) States of the total system are associated with
vectors in the Hilbert space. (iii) Schr\&quot;odinger equation is the dynamical law
in each valid FR. (iv) Under certain condition a property of a system can be
regarded as a reference property; vector descriptions of the total system given
in different FRs of the same RS may have a probabilistic relationship like in
Born's rule.

projections of the matrix onto some selected basis. We suggest a method to test
separability, based on successive optimization programs. First, we find the
Minimum Volume Covering Ellipsoid that encloses a particular set of properly
vectorized bipartite separable states, and then we compute the Euclidean
distance of an arbitrary vectorized bipartite Density Operator to this
ellipsoid. If the vectorized Density Operator falls inside the ellipsoid, it is
regarded as separable, otherwise it will be taken as entangled. Our method is
scalable and can be implemented straightforwardly in any desired dimension.

that can be considered a generalization of the Born rule. The principle is
composed of a mathematical expression and an associated interpretation, and
establishes a correlation between the positions of a particle at two different
times. Under reasonable conditions for the wave function, this correlation
implies that the particles follow quasi-classical trajectories. It is also
shown that the Born rule is equivalent to a particular case of the new
principle. These features allow the principle to provide a unified explanation
of the results of the statistical experiments and of the quasi-classical
macroscopic evolution.
  There is a strong analogy between the new quantum principle and a
probabilistic principle which is necessary to derive empirical predictions from
the mathematical formalism of probability theory. This principle is referred to
by some authors as Cournot's principle, while other authors use the equivalent
notion of typicality. In this paper probability theory and quantum mechanics
are formulated in such a way as to explicitly include the two principles and to
emphasize the very similar conceptual structure of the two theories.

  easier observation of Berry phases</title><description>  We consider a two-level system coupled to a highly non-Markovian environment
when the coupling axis rotates with time. The environment may be quantum (for
example a bosonic bath or a spin bath) or classical (such as classical noise).
We show that an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe suppresses transitions, so
that the system's instantaneous eigenstates (parallel and anti-parallel to the
coupling axis) can adiabatically follow the rotation. These states thereby
acquire Berry phases; geometric phases given by the area enclosed by the
coupling axis. Unlike in earlier proposals for environment-induced Berry
phases, here there is little decoherence, so one does not need a
decoherence-free subspace. Indeed we show that this Berry phase should be much
easier to observe than a conventional one, because it is not masked by either
the dynamic phase or the leading non-adiabatic phase. The effects that we
discuss should be observable in any qubit device where one can drive three
parameters in the Hamiltonian with strong man-made noise.

  local particle number superselection rule</title><description>  Global conservation laws imply superselection rules (SSR) which restrict the
operations that are possible on any given state. Imposing the additional
constraint of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) forbids the
transfer of quantum systems between spatially separated sites. In the case of
particle conservation this imposes a SSR for local particle number. That is,
the coherences between subspaces of fixed particle number at each site are not
accessible and any state is therefore equivalent to its projection onto these
subspaces. The accessible entanglement under the SSR is less than (or equal to)
that available in the absence of the SSR. An ancilla can be used as a reference
system to increase the amount of accessible entanglement. We examine the
relationship between local particle number uncertainty and the accessible
entanglement and consider the optimal reference states for recovering
entanglement from certain systems. In particular we derive the optimal ancilla
state for extracting entanglement for a single shared particle and make steps
towards the optimum for general systems.

parameters are infinitesimally close, it is known that the leading term behaves
as $O(L^\alpha)$ ($L$ system size) where $\alpha$ is equal to the spatial
dimension $d$ for gapped systems, and otherwise depends on the critical
exponents. Here we show that when parameters are changed along a critical
manifold, a sub-leading O(1) term can appear. This term, somewhat similar to
the topological entanglement entropy, depends only on the system's universality
class and encodes non-trivial information about the topology of the system. We
relate it to universal $g$ factors and partition functions of (boundary)
conformal field theory in $d=1$ and $d=2$ dimensions. Numerical checks are

spin of a single NV center in diamond, using the effects of cavity quantum
electrodynamics. The scheme we propose is based in the one dimensional atom or
Purcell regime, removing the need for high Q cavities that are challenging to
fabricate. The ground state of the NV center consists of three spin levels
$^{3}A_{(m=0)}$ and $^{3}A_{(m=\pm1)}$ (the $\pm1$ states are near degenerate
in zero field). These two states can undergo transitions to the excited
($^{3}E$) state, with an energy difference of $\approx7-10$ $\mu$eV between the
two. By choosing the correct Q factor, this small detuning between the two
transitions results in a dramatic change in the intensity of reflected light.
We show the change in reflected intensity can allow us to read out the ground
state spin using a low intensity laser with an error rate of
$\approx5.5\times10^{-3}$, when realistic cavity and experimental parameters
are considered. Since very low levels of light are used to probe the state of
the spin we limit the number of florescence cycles, thereby limiting the non
spin preserving transitions through the intermediate singlet state $^{1}A$.

Specifically, the interplay between Hamiltonian perturbations and dynamically

computation which seeks to transform the initial ground state of a quantum
system into a final ground state encoding the answer to a computational
problem. AQC initial Hamiltonians conventionally have a uniform superposition
as ground state. We diverge from this practice by introducing a simple form of
heuristics: the ability to start the quantum evolution with a state which is a
guess to the solution of the problem. With this goal in mind, we explain the
viability of this approach and the needed modifications to the conventional AQC
(CAQC) algorithm. By performing a numerical study on hard-to-satisfy 6 and 7
bit random instances of the satisfiability problem (3-SAT), we show how this
heuristic approach is possible and we identify that the performance of the
particular algorithm proposed is largely determined by the Hamming distance of
the chosen initial guess state with respect to the solution. Besides the
possibility of introducing educated guesses as initial states, the new strategy
allows for the possibility of restarting a failed adiabatic process from the
measured excited state as opposed to restarting from the full superposition of
states as in CAQC. The outcome of the measurement can be used as a more refined
guess state to restart the adiabatic evolution. This concatenated restart
process is another heuristic that the CAQC strategy cannot capture.

by a quantum computer. This belief is supported by the discovery that a
noiseless (pure) state quantum computer must generate a large amount of
entanglement in order to offer any speed up over a classical computer. However,
deterministic quantum computation with one pure qubit (DQC1), which employs
noisy (mixed) states, is an efficient model that generates at most a marginal
amount of entanglement. Although this model cannot implement any arbitrary
algorithm it can efficiently solve a range of problems of significant
importance to the scientific community. Here we experimentally implement a
first-order case of a key DQC1 algorithm and explicitly characterise the
non-classical correlations generated. Our results show that while there is no
entanglement the algorithm does give rise to other non-classical correlations,
which we quantify using the quantum discord - a stronger measure of
non-classical correlations that includes entanglement as a subset. Our results
suggest that discord could replace entanglement as a necessary resource for a
quantum computational speed-up. Furthermore, DQC1 is far less resource
intensive than universal quantum computing and our implementation in a scalable
architecture highlights the model as a practical short-term goal.

on a circular orbit. At the quantum level, the fact that all classical orbits
are closed gives rise to degeneracies in the spectrum. It is well-known that
the spectrum of a charged particle in a constant magnetic field consists of
infinitely degenerate Landau levels. Just as for the $1/r$ and $r^2$
potentials, one thus expects some hidden accidental symmetry, in this case with
infinite-dimensional representations. Indeed, the position of the center of the
cyclotron circle plays the role of a Runge-Lenz vector. After identifying the
corresponding accidental symmetry algebra, we re-analyze the system in a finite
periodic volume. Interestingly, similar to the quantum mechanical breaking of
CP invariance due to the $\theta$-vacuum angle in non-Abelian gauge theories,
quantum effects due to two self-adjoint extension parameters $\theta_x$ and
$\theta_y$ explicitly break the continuous translation invariance of the
classical theory. This reduces the symmetry to a discrete magnetic translation
group and leads to finite degeneracy. Similar to a particle moving on a cone, a
particle in a constant magnetic field shows a very peculiar realization of
accidental symmetry in quantum mechanics.

non-identical particle entanglement, the use of fermionic entanglement is
constrained by a parity superselection rule. Nevertheless we show that within
the framework of second quantization, where local modes play the role of

perform standard dense coding. Entanglement concentration and dilution are
possible for fermions. We clarify the meaning of our results by discussing the

hyperfine manifolds of a single atom trapped within a high-finesse optical
cavity. In both schemes, the Raman coupling is generated by standing-wave
fields inside the cavity, thus circumventing the optical access limitations
that free-space Raman schemes must face in a cavity system. These cavity-based
Raman schemes can be used to coherently manipulate both the internal and the

studying cavity quantum electrodynamics. We give a detailed theoretical

the axial motion of the atom to the quantum ground state, and we perform

  General Relativity</title><description>  The paper has heuristic character. The conceptual frame, based on the
assumption of quantum uncertainty only, has been formerly introduced in two
papers [S. Tosto, Il Nuovo Cimento B, vol. 111, n.2, 1996 and S. Tosto, Il
Nuovo Cimento D, vol. 18, n.12, 1996]. Instead of attempting to increase the
accuracy of some existing computational model through a new kind of
approximation, these papers acknowledge since the beginning the lack of
deterministic information about the local properties of the constituent
particles, considered random, unknown and unpredictable and thus ignored in
principle. The leading idea is that the physical properties of quantum systems
could be inferred merely considering the delocalization ranges of dynamical
variables, rather than their local values. In effect, despite the agnostic
character of the approach proposed, both papers show that the kind of physical
information reachable reproduces exactly in all cases examined that obtained
solving the pertinent wave equations. The concept of quantum uncertainty is
further extended in the present paper to both space and time coordinates,
considering thus a unique spacetime delocalization range and still discarding
since the beginning the local values of the conjugate dynamical variables. The
paper shows an unexpected wealth of information obtainable simply extending the
concept of space uncertainty to that of spacetime uncertainty: the results are
inherently consistent with that of the operator formalism of wave mechanics and
with the basic postulates of special relativity, both inferred as corollaries.
Moreover, even the gravity appears to be essentially a quantum phenomenon. The
most relevant outcomes of special and general relativity are achieved as
straightforward consequence of the space-time delocalization of particles using
the simple quantum formalism first introduced in the early papers.

implemented using quantum-key-distribution (QKD) hardware in the practical

We derive trade-offs between the amount of storage noise, the amount of noise

oblivious transfer which are greatly improved compared to the results in

storage we can obtain secure oblivious transfer as long as the quantum
bit-error rate of the channel does not exceed 11% and the noise on the channel
is strictly less than the quantum storage noise. This is optimal for the

  Theory</title><description>  We introduce a perturbative approach to solving the time dependent
Schroedinger equation, named adiabatic perturbation theory (APT), whose zeroth
order term is the quantum adiabatic approximation. The small parameter in the
power series expansion of the time-dependent wave function is the inverse of
the time it takes to drive the system's Hamiltonian from the initial to its
final form. We review other standard perturbative and non-perturbative ways of
going beyond the adiabatic approximation, extending and finding exact relations
among them, and also compare the efficiency of those methods against the APT.
Most importantly, we determine APT corrections to the Berry phase by use of the
Aharonov-Anandan geometric phase. We then solve several time dependent problems
allowing us to illustrate that the APT is the only perturbative method that
gives the right corrections to the adiabatic approximation. Finally, we propose
an experiment to measure the APT corrections to the Berry phase and show, for a
particular spin-1/2 problem, that to first order in APT the geometric phase
should be two and a half times the (adiabatic) Berry phase.

but a certain number of copies of them are available instead. Two reference
states are independently and randomly chosen from the state space in a unitary
invariant way. This is called the quantum state identification problem, and the
task is to optimize the mean identification success probability. In this paper,
we consider the case where each reference state is pure and bipartite, and
generally entangled. The question is whether the maximum mean identification
success probability can be attained by means of a local operations and
classical communication (LOCC) measurement scheme. Two types of identification
problems are considered when a single copy of each reference state is

the special case where A is classical, this overlap corresponds to the

this corresponds to the security of A when used as a secret key in the presence

disentanglement time decreases with the increasing of squeeze parameter r, due
to the augmenting of average photon number of every mode in squeezed vacuum

for the case of even parity initial Bell state, while there are entanglement

  Characterization</title><description>  We demonstrate a new technique for characterizing two-photon quantum states
based on joint temporal correlation measurements using time resolved single
photon detection by femtosecond upconversion. We measure for the first time the
joint temporal density of a two-photon entangled state, showing clearly the
time anti-correlation of the coincident-frequency entangled photon pair
generated by ultrafast spontaneous parametric down-conversion under extended
phase-matching conditions. The new technique enables us to manipulate the
frequency entanglement by varying the down-conversion pump bandwidth to produce
a nearly unentangled two-photon state that is expected to yield a heralded
single-photon state with a purity of 0.88. The time-domain correlation
technique complements existing frequency-domain measurement methods for a more

matter physics and in quantum information science. In condensed matter systems,
the subsystems are examined traditionally by using the Green function and
mean-field-like methods based on the Heisenberg representation. In quantum
information science, the subsystems are handled by composite density matrix,
its marginals describing the subsystems, and the Kraus representation to
elucidate the subsystem properties. In this work, a relationship is first
established between the two techniques which appear to be distinct at first
sight. This will be illustrated in detail by presenting the two methods in the
case of the celebrated exactly soluable Jaynes - Cummings model (1963) of a
two-state atom interacting with a one-mode quantized electromagnetic field. The
dynamics of this system was treated in the Heisenberg representation by
Ackerhalt and Rzazewski (1975). We present here the corresponding subdynamics
using Kraus representation. A relationship between the two approaches is
established and the relative merits of the two techniques are discussed in
elucidating the distinctive features of the subdynamics. The striking effects
of interaction and entanglement are made transparent in two illustrative
examples: the transformations that manifest in non-interacting number and spin
representations due to interactions in their respective subspaces.

quantum superpositions, although the obtained results should be generalizable
to similar experiments. We analyze in detail the effects of finite temperature

of non-classicality of the cantilever. Although it is possible to measure the
quantum decoherence time when starting from finite temperature, an unambiguous
demonstration of a quantum superposition requires the mechanical resonator to
be in or near the ground state. This can be achieved by optical cooling of the
fundamental mode, which also provides a method to measure the mean phonon

decoherence and estimate the timescale for gravitational collapse mechanisms as
proposed by Penrose and Diosi. In view of recent experimental advances,
practical considerations for the realization of the described experiment are

non-local descriptions while retaining causality leads to a clash with the
theory of relativity. Furthermore, the causal arrow of time by definition
contradicts time-reversal symmetry. For these reasons, some authors (Feynman

microscopic causality. In the present article, a simplistic but concrete
example of following this line of thought is presented, in the form of a
retro-causal toy-model which is stochastic and which provides an appealing
description of the specific quantum correlations discussed by Bell. One

simulations of quantum random walks (QRW). Specifically, in the case of a QRW
on the line with one particle (walker) and two entangled coins, we explain the
phenomenon, called &quot;localization&quot;, whereby the probability distribution of the
walker's position is seen to exhibit a persistent major &quot;spike&quot; (or &quot;peak&quot;) at
the initial position and two other minor spikes which drift to infinity in
either direction. Another interesting finding in connection with QRW's of this
sort pertains to the limiting behavior of the position probability
distribution. It is seen that the probability of finding the walker at any
given location becomes eventually stationary and non-vanishing. We explain
these observations in terms of the degeneration of some eigenvalue of the time
evolution operator $U(k)$. An explicit general formula is derived for the
limiting probability, from which we deduce the limiting value of the height of
the observed spike at the origin. We show that the limiting probability
decreases {\em quadratically} for large values of the position $x$. We locate
the two minor spikes and demonstrate that their positions are determined by the
phases of non-degenerated eigenvalues of $U(k)$. Finally, for fixed time $t$
sufficiently large, we examine the dependence on $t$ of the probability of
finding a particle at a given location $x$.

Leggett-type inequality that was claimed to be valid for a broad class of
non-local hidden-variable theories. The impossibility of constructing a
non-local and realistic theory, unless it entails highly counterintuitive
features, seems thus to have been experimentally proved. This would bring us
close to a definite refutation of realism. Indeed, realism was proved to be
also incompatible with locality, according to a series of experiments testing
Bell inequalities. The present paper addresses the said experiments of
Groeblacher et al. and presents an explicit, contextual and realistic, model
that reproduces the predictions of quantum mechanics. It thus violates the
Leggett-type inequality that was established with the aim of ruling out a
supposedly broad class of non-local models. We can thus conclude that plausible
contextual, realistic, models are still tenable. This restates the possibility
of a future completion of quantum mechanics by a realistic and contextual
theory which is not in a class containing only highly counterintuitive models.
The class that was ruled out by the experiments of Groeblacher et al. is thus
proved to be a limited one, arbitrarily separating models that physically
belong in the same class.

  propagation</title><description>  We analyze the propagation of a pulse across a vacuum gap separating opposite
flat parallel faces of two transparent dielectrics by means of an explicitly
causal and retarded propagator constructed directly from the free-space wave
equation. Nevertheless, our approach yields apparently superluminal propagation
for the case of frustrated total internal reflection (FTIR), that is, a
transmitted wave packet appears on the far side of the gap at the same time
that the corresponding incident packet crosses the front one. Thus, in this
example superluminality is just an illusion, being consistent with both
casuality and classical electrodynamics. We study the origin of the apparent
superluminality in this case, which is inherent to light pulse propagation in
free space and does not depend on the particulars of light-matter interaction,
and find that it is due to propagation from the lateral wings of the incident
pulse to the central part of the transmitted pulse. Thus, notwithstanding their
similarities, FTIR is not equivalent to 1D tunneling. We propose experiments to
test our explanation of superluminality using opaque screens to block part of
the wavefront, although we demonstrate that the propagation of smooth finite
pulses constrained to be made up completely of evanescent Fourier components is
indistinguishable from truly superluminal propagation, i.e., it may be
completely accounted for using an explicitely superluminal and acausal
propagator as well as the causal subluminal one.

recipe for designing a detector that measures a given observable. Compounding
this, the characterization of existing detectors is typically based on partial
calibrations or elaborate models. Thus, experimental specification (i.e.
tomography) of a detector is of fundamental and practical importance. Here, we
present the realization of quantum detector tomography: we identify the optimal
positive-operator-valued measure describing the detector, with no ancillary
assumptions. This result completes the triad, state, process, and detector
tomography, required to fully specify an experiment. We characterize an

single parameter is varied through a critical point, where the ground state and
the first excited state become degenerate. When this parameter appears as a
coupling constant, these models can be understood as straight-line
interpolations between different Hamiltonians $H_{\rm I}$ and $H_{\rm F}$. For
finite-size realizations however, there will usually be a finite energy gap
between ground and first excited state. By slowly changing the coupling
constant through the point with the minimum energy gap one thereby has an
adiabatic algorithm that prepares the ground state of $H_{\rm F}$ from the
ground state of $H_{\rm I}$. The adiabatic theorem implies that in order to
obtain a good preparation fidelity the runtime $\tau$ should scale with the
inverse energy gap and thereby also with the system size. In addition, for open
quantum systems not only non-adiabatic but also thermal excitations are likely
to occur. It is shown that -- using only local Hamiltonians -- for the 1d
quantum Ising model and the cluster model in a transverse field the
conventional straight line path can be replaced by a series of straight-line
interpolations, along which the fundamental energy gap is always greater than a
constant independent on the system size. The results are of interest for
adiabatic quantum computation since strong similarities between adiabatic
quantum algorithms and quantum phase transitions exist.

  application to the quantum cavity method and to Monte Carlo simulations</title><description>  The cavity method is a well established technique for solving classical spin
models on sparse random graphs (mean-field models with finite connectivity).
Laumann et al. [arXiv:0706.4391] proposed recently an extension of this method
to quantum spin-1/2 models in a transverse field, using a discretized
Suzuki-Trotter imaginary time formalism. Here we show how to take analytically
the continuous imaginary time limit. Our main technical contribution is an
explicit procedure to generate the spin trajectories in a path integral
representation of the imaginary time dynamics. As a side result we also show
how this procedure can be used in simple heat-bath like Monte Carlo simulations
of generic quantum spin models. The replica symmetric continuous time quantum
cavity method is formulated for a wide class of models, and applied as a simple
example on the Bethe lattice ferromagnet in a transverse field. The results of
the methods are confronted with various approximation schemes in this
particular case. On this system we performed quantum Monte Carlo simulations
that confirm the exactness of the cavity method in the thermodynamic limit.

complexity, for the case where one party is quantum and the other is classical.
We show that in an SMP protocol that computes some function with the first
party sending q qubits and the second sending c classical bits, the quantum
message can be replaced by a randomized message of O(qc) classical bits, as
well as by a deterministic message of O(q c log q) classical bits. Our proofs
rely heavily on earlier results due to Scott Aaronson.
  In particular, our results imply that quantum-classical protocols need to
send Omega(sqrt{n/log n}) bits/qubits to compute Equality on n-bit strings, and
hence are not significantly better than classical-classical protocols (and are
much worse than quantum-quantum protocols such as quantum fingerprinting). This
essentially answers a recent question of Wim van Dam. Our results also imply,
more generally, that there are no superpolynomial separations between
quantum-classical and classical-classical SMP protocols for functional
problems. This contrasts with the situation for relational problems, where
exponential gaps between quantum-classical and classical-classical SMP
protocols are known. We show that this surprising situation cannot arise in
purely classical models: there, an exponential separation for a relational

characteristics of the latter group, an abstract group of order d**3 noted P_d,
are given (conjugacy classes and irreducible representation classes or
equivalently Lie algebra of dimension d**3 associated with P_d). Leaving the
abstract sector, a set of Weyl pairs in dimension d is derived from a polar
decomposition of SU(2) closely connected to angular momentum theory. Then, a
realization of the generalized Pauli group P_d and the construction of
generalized Pauli matrices in dimension d are revisited in terms of Weyl pairs.
Finally, the Lie algebra of the unitary group U(d) is obtained as a subalgebra
of the Lie algebra associated with P_d. This leads to a development of the Lie
algebra of U(d) in a basis consisting of d**2 generalized Pauli matrices. In
the case where d is a power of a prime integer, the Lie algebra of SU(d) can be
decomposed into d-1 Cartan subalgebras.

classically chaotic quantum motion. We analyze the connection between
reversibility and the rate at which a quantum state acquires a more and more
complicated structure in its time evolution. This complexity is characterized
by the number ${\cal M}(t)$ of harmonics of the (initially isotropic, i.e.
${\cal M}(0)=0$) Wigner function, which are generated during quantum evolution
for the time $t$. We show that, in contrast to the classical exponential
increase, this number can grow not faster than linearly and then relate this
fact with the degree of reversibility of the quantum motion. To explore the
reversibility we reverse the quantum evolution at some moment $T$ immediately
after applying at this moment an instant perturbation governed by a strength
parameter $\xi$. It follows that there exists a critical perturbation strength,
$\xi_c\approx \sqrt{2}/{\cal M}(T)$, below which the initial state is well
recovered, whereas reversibility disappears when $\xi\gtrsim \xi_c(T)$. In the
classical limit the number of harmonics proliferates exponentially with time
and the motion becomes practically irreversible. The above results are
illustrated in the example of the kicked quartic oscillator model.

the secular approximation. In particular, it is found that the non-linear
processes lead to squeezing of the fluctuations of the cavity field below the
quantum shot noise limit. The squeezing depends on the relative population of
the dressed states of the system and is found only if there is no population
inversion between the dressed states. Furthermore, we find a linewidth
narrowing below the quantum limit in the spectrum of the cavity field that is
achieved only when the secular approximation is not made. An interpretation of
the linewidth narrowing is provided in terms of two phase dependent noise
(squeezing) spectra that make up the incoherent spectrum. We establish that the
linewidth narrowing is due squeezing of the fluctuations in one quadrature
phase components of the cavity field.

  spin chain</title><description>  Taking the decoherence effect due to population relaxation into account, we
investigate the entanglement properties for two qubits in the Heisenberg XY
interaction and subject to an external magnetic field. It is found that the
phenomenon of entanglement sudden death (ESD) as well as sudden birth(ESB)
appear during the evolution process for particular initial states. The
influence of the external magnetic field and the spin environment on ESD and
ESB are addressed in detail. It is shown that the concurrence, a measure of
entanglement, can be controlled by tuning the parameters of the spin chain,
such as the anisotropic parameter, external magnetic field, and the coupling
strength with their environment. In particular, we find that a critical
anisotropy constant exists, above which ESB vanishes while ESD appears. It is
also notable that stable entanglement, which is independent of different
initial states of the qubits, occurs even in the presence of decoherence.

Hamiltonian do not correspond to any observable and one has to infer its value
by an indirect measurement. For this purpose, quantum systems at criticality
can be considered as a resource to improve the ultimate quantum limits to
precision of the estimation procedure. In this paper, we consider the
one-dimensional quantum Ising model as a paradigmatic example of many-body
system exhibiting criticality, and derive the optimal quantum estimator of the
coupling constant varying size and temperature. We find the optimal external
field, which maximizes the quantum Fisher information of the coupling constant,
both for few spins and in the thermodynamic limit, and show that at the
critical point a precision improvement of order $L$ is achieved. We also show
that the measurement of the total magnetization provides optimal estimation for
couplings larger than a threshold value, which itself decreases with
temperature.

attracted a lot of attention as a basic building block for quantum information
processing and quantum state engineering. The field started with the
realization that optically thick free space ensembles can be efficiently
interfaced with quantum optical fields. By now the atomic ensemble - light
interfaces have become a powerful alternative to the cavity-enhanced
interaction of light with single atoms. We discuss various mechanisms used for
the quantum interface, including quantum nondemolition or Faraday interaction,
quantum measurement and feedback, Raman interaction and electromagnetically
induced transparency. The paper provides a common theoretical frame for these
processes, describes basic experimental techniques and media used for quantum
interfaces, and reviews several key experiments on quantum memory for light,
quantum entanglement between atomic ensembles and light, and quantum
teleportation with atomic ensembles. We discuss the two types of quantum
measurements which are most important for the interface: homodyne detection and
photon counting. The paper concludes with an outlook on the future of atomic
ensembles as an enabling technology in quantum information processing.

(QPTs) in the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) of nuclear structure. The model in
its infinite-size limit exhibits shape-phase transitions between spherical,
deformed prolate, and deformed oblate forms of the ground state. Finite-size
precursors of such behavior are verified by robust variations of nuclear
properties (nuclear masses, excitation energies, transition probabilities for
low lying levels) across the chart of nuclides. Simultaneously, the model
serves as a theoretical laboratory for studying diverse general features of
QPTs in interacting many-body systems, which differ in many respects from
lattice models of solid-state physics. We outline the most important fields of
the present interest: (a) The coexistence of first- and second-order phase
transitions supports studies related to the microscopic origin of the QPT
phenomena. (b) The competing quantum phases are characterized by specific
dynamical symmetries and novel symmetry related approaches are developed to
describe also the transitional dynamical domains. (c) In some parameter
regions, the QPT-like behavior can be ascribed also to individual excited
states, which is linked to the thermodynamic and classical descriptions of the
system. (d) The model and its phase structure can be extended in many
directions: by separating proton and neutron excitations, considering
odd-fermion degrees of freedom or different particle-hole configurations, by
including other types of bosons, higher order interactions, and by imposing
external rotation. All these aspects of IBM phase transitions are relevant in
the interpretation of experimental data and important for a fundamental
understanding of the QPT phenomenon.

stationary dark-state polaritons. Dark-state polaritons (DSPs) are formed in
the interaction of light with laser-driven 3-level Lambda-type atoms and are
the basis of phenomena such as electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT),
ultra-slow and stored light. They have long intrinsic lifetimes and in a
stationary set-up with two counterpropagating control fields of equal intensity
have a 3D quadratic dispersion profile with variable effective mass. Since DSPs
are bosons they can undergo a Bose-Einstein condensation at a critical
temperature which can be many orders of magnitude larger than that of atoms. We
show that thermalization of polaritons can occur via elastic collisions
mediated by a resonantly enhanced optical Kerr nonlinearity on a time scale
short compared to the decay time. Finally condensation can be observed by
turning stationary into propagating polaritons and monitoring the emitted
light.

  Breaks?</title><description>  We extend the theory of symmetry breaking dynamics in non-equilibrium second
order phase transitions known as the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) to
transitions where the change of phase occurs not in time, but in space. This
can be due to a time-independent spatial variation of a field that imposes a
phase with one symmetry to the left of where it attains critical value, while
allowing spontaneous symmetry breaking to the right of that critical
borderline. Topological defects need not form in such a situation. We show,
however, that the size, in space, of the ``scar'' over which the order
parameter adjusts as it ``bends'' interpolating between the phases with
different symmetry follows from a KZM - like approach. As we illustrate on the
example of a transverse quantum Ising model, in quantum phase transitions this
spatial scale -- the size of the scar -- is directly reflected in the energy
spectrum of the system: In particular, it determines the size of the energy
gap.

rendered non-trivial by the fact that the stabilizer label code, a code that is

The elimination or reduction of Casimir &quot;stiction&quot; by appropriate engineering

small background Drude contributions to the permittivity act to enhance
attraction over repulsion, as does magnetic dissipation. In dielectric-based

hidden variable theory fulfils certain conditions, the inequality of Bell can
be violated. Moreover, Nelson was able to prove that this may happen without
any instantaneous communication between the two spatially separated measurement

review his comments on Bell's theorem. We argue that a modification of
stochastic mechanics published recently by Fritsche and Haugk can be extended
to a theory which fulfils the requirements of Nelson's analysis. The article

the Pauli equation from this version of stochastic mechanics. Then, we

whether the FS's dimensions of two neighboring quantum phases are the same or

the change in the FS's dimension is a characteristic that separates two phases.
As a non-trivial application to the Kitaev honeycomb model, we find that the FS

experimentally relevant situation of photon losses. Our results thus reveal the
benchmark for precision in optical interferometry. Although this boundary is
generally worse than the Heisenberg limit, we show that the obtained precision
beats the standard quantum limit thus leading to a significant improvement
compared to classical interferometers. We furthermore discuss alternative
states and strategies to the optimized states which are easier to generate at
the cost of only slightly lower precision.

a general scheme of mechanics, called `supmech', is developed integrating
noncommutative symplectic geometry and noncommutative probability theory in an
algebraic framework; it has quantum mechanics (QM) and classical mechanics as
special subdisciplines and facilitates an autonomous development of QM and
satisfactory treatments of quantum-classical correspondence and quantum
measurements (including a straightforward \emph{derivation} of the von Neumann
reduction rule). The scheme associates, with every `experimentally accessible'
system, a symplectic superalgebra and operates essentially as noncommutative
Hamiltonian mechanics incorporating the extra condition that the sets of
observables and pure states be mutually separating. The latter condition serves
to smoothly connect the algebraically defined quantum systems to ilbert
space-based ones; the rigged Hilbert space - based Dirac bra-ket formalism
naturally appears. The formalism has a natural place for commutative
superselection rules. Noncommutative analogues of objects like the momentum map
and the Poincar$\acute{e}$-Cartan form are introduced and some related
symplectic geometry developed.

unitary reflections (unitary transformations that leave invariant a hyperplane
of a vector space). The symmetries of qubit systems are found to be supported
by Euclidean real reflections (i.e., Coxeter groups) or by specific imprimitive
reflection groups, introduced (but not named) in a recent paper [Planat M and
Jorrand Ph 2008, {\it J Phys A: Math Theor} {\bf 41}, 182001]. The
automorphisms of multiple qubit systems are found to relate to some Clifford
operations once the corresponding group of reflections is identified. For a
short list, one may point out the Coxeter systems of type $B_3$ and $G_2$ (for
single qubits), $D_5$ and $A_4$ (for two qubits), $E_7$ and $E_6$ (for three
qubits), the complex reflection groups $G(2^l,2,5)$ and groups No 9 and 31 in
the Shephard-Todd list. The relevant fault tolerant subsets of the Clifford
groups (the Bell groups) are generated by the Hadamard gate, the $\pi/4$ phase
gate and an entangling (braid) gate [Kauffman L H and Lomonaco S J 2004 {\it
New J. of Phys.} {\bf 6}, 134]. Links to the topological view of quantum
computing, the lattice approach and the geometry of smooth cubic surfaces are
discussed.

fields can be described classically or quantum mechanically, even for very low
temperatures and mean number of photons, provided the damping constant is large
enough. We investigate the quantum-classical border, the entanglement and
decoherence of an analytically solvable model, analog to the atom-cavity
system, in which the atom (field) is represented by a (driven and damped)
harmonic oscillator. The maximum value of entanglement is shown to depend on
the initial state and the dissipation-rate to coupling-constant ratio. While in
the original model the atomic entropy never grows appreciably (for large
dissipation rates), in our model it reaches a maximum before decreasing.
Although both models predict small values of entanglement and dissipation, for
fixed times of the order of the inverse of the coupling constant and large
dissipation rates, these quantities decrease faster, as a function of the ratio
of the dissipation rate to the coupling constant, in our model.

unconditionally for any value of the loss. In the relevant regime of low-energy

rather it is a consequence of quantum mechanics. The uncertainty relation is
then a probabilistic statement and can be clearly evaded in processes which
occur with a very small probability in a tiny sector of the phase space. This
clear evasion is typically realized when one utilizes indirect measurements,
and some examples of the clear evasion appear in the system with entanglement
though the entanglement by itself is not essential for the evasion. The
standard Kennard's relation and its interpretation remain intact in our

  As an explicit example, we show that the clear evasion of the uncertainty

Wave-particle duality arises because the wave functions alone have both

Calderbank-Shor-Steane structure as in previous work. We provide two
significant advances for quantum convolutional coding theory. We first show how
to &quot;expand&quot; a given set of quantum convolutional generators. This expansion
step acts as a preprocessor for a polynomial symplectic Gram-Schmidt
orthogonalization procedure that simplifies the commutation relations of the
expanded generators to be the same as those of entangled Bell states (ebits)

equivalent error-correcting properties to those of the original generators. We
then demonstrate how to perform online encoding and decoding for a stream of

codes with desirable error-correcting properties without having to worry about
the commutation relations of these generators.

They are compatible in the sense that they do not take the logical (encoded)

  Brownian-Motion Master Equation</title><description>  The &quot;standard&quot; Brownian motion master equation, used to describe thermal
damping, is not completely positive, and does not admit a Monte Carlo method,
important in numerical simulations. To eliminate both these problems one must
add a term that generates additional position diffusion. He we show that one
can obtain a completely positive simple quantum Brownian motion, efficiently
solvable, without any extra diffusion. This is achieved by using a stochastic
Schroedinger equation (SSE), closely analogous to Langevin's equation, that has
no equivalent Markovian master equation. Considering a specific example, we
show that this SSE is sensitive to nonlinearities in situations in which the
master equation is not, and may therefore be a better model of damping for
nonlinear systems.

quantum computation for her such that the client's inputs, outputs and
computation remain perfectly private, and where she does not require any
quantum computational power or memory. The client only needs to be able to
prepare single qubits randomly chosen from a finite set and send them to the
server, who has the balance of the required quantum computational resources.
Our protocol is interactive: after the initial preparation of quantum states,
the client and server use two-way classical communication which enables the
client to drive the computation, giving single-qubit measurement instructions
to the server, depending on previous measurement outcomes. Our protocol works
for inputs and outputs that are either classical or quantum. We give an
authentication protocol that allows the client to detect an interfering server;
our scheme can also be made fault-tolerant.
  We also generalize our result to the setting of a purely classical client who
communicates classically with two non-communicating entangled servers, in order
to perform a blind quantum computation. By incorporating the authentication
protocol, we show that any problem in BQP has an entangled two-prover
interactive proof with a purely classical verifier.
  Our protocol is the first universal scheme which detects a cheating server,
as well as the first protocol which does not require any quantum computation
whatsoever on the client's side. The novelty of our approach is in using the
unique features of measurement-based quantum computing which allows us to
clearly distinguish between the quantum and classical aspects of a quantum
computation.

  transparency via interacting dressed ground states</title><description>  We offer a general treatment of electromagnetically induced transparency
(EIT) in a five level system consisting of four metastable ground states. Two
additional RF/microwave fields coherently couple the two ground states of the
standard EIT $\Lambda$ atom to a pair of additional hyperfine states in the
ground state manifold, generating two sets of dressed states that interact via
the probe and control lasers, which couple to the electronic excited state.
These new hyperfine dressed states manifest themselves in the linear optical
susceptibility of the probe as new resonances in addition to the Autler-Townes
doublet characteristic of EIT. In particular, we show that the existence of two
new narrow resonances, whose width are limited only by ground state
decoherence, appear inside the normal EIT transparency window. We show that by
controlling the intensity of these RF/microwave fields, one can engineer both
the position and width of these narrow resonances and thereby exercise
additional control over both the dispersion and group velocity of the probe.

but also a key resource in quantum information science. The entanglement
content of random pure quantum states is almost maximal; such states find
applications in various quantum information protocols. The preparation of a
random state or, equivalently, the implementation of a random unitary operator,
requires a number of elementary one- and two-qubit gates that is exponential in
the number n_q of qubits, thus becoming rapidly unfeasible when increasing n_q.
On the other hand, pseudo-random states approximating to the desired accuracy
the entanglement properties of true random states may be generated efficiently,
that is, polynomially in n_q. In particular, quantum chaotic maps are efficient
generators of multipartite entanglement among the qubits, close to that
expected for random states. This review discusses several aspects of the
relationship between entanglement, randomness and chaos. In particular, I will
focus on the following items: (i) the robustness of the entanglement generated
by quantum chaotic maps when taking into account the unavoidable noise sources
affecting a quantum computer; (ii) the detection of the entanglement of
high-dimensional (mixtures of) random states, an issue also related to the
question of the emergence of classicality in coarse grained quantum chaotic
dynamics; (iii) the decoherence induced by the coupling of a system to a
chaotic environment, that is, by the entanglement established between the
system and the environment.

know which operational principles make it so. All axiomatization attempts
suffer at least one postulate of a mathematical nature. Here I will analyze the
possibility of deriving QM as the mathematical representation of a &quot;fair
operational framework&quot;, i.e. a set of rules which allows the experimenter to
make predictions on future &quot;events&quot; on the basis of suitable &quot;tests&quot;, e.g.
without interference from uncontrollable sources. Two postulates need to be
satisfied by any fair operational framework: NSF: &quot;no-signaling from the
future&quot;--for the possibility of making predictions on the basis of past tests;
PFAITH: &quot;existence of a preparationally faithful state&quot;--for the possibility of
preparing any state and calibrating any test. I will show that all theories
satisfying NSF admit a C*-algebra representation of events as linear
transformations of effects. Based on a very general notion of dynamical
independence, it is easy to see that all such probabilistic theories are
&quot;non-signaling without interaction&quot; (&quot;non-signaling&quot; for short)--another
requirement for a fair operational framework. Postulate PFAITH then implies the
&quot;local observability principle&quot;, the tensor-product structure for the linear
spaces of states and effects, the impossibility of bit commitment and
additional features, such an operational definition of transpose, a scalar
product for effects, weak-selfduality of the theory, and more. Dual to
Postulate PFAITH an analogous postulate for effects would give additional
quantum features, such as teleportation. However, all possible consequences of
these postulates still need to be investigated, and it is not clear yet if we
can derive QM from the present postulates only. [CONTINUES on manuscript]

quantum computation. The model we consider is the DQC1 or `power of one qubit'
model. I show that there is minimal bipartite entanglement in a typical
instance of the DQC1 circuit and even put an upper bound on the possible amount
of entanglement. This limited amount of entanglement, however, does not imply
that the system is classically simulatable. A matrix product state (MPS)
algorithm for a typical instance of the DQC1 system requires exponential
classical resources. This exposes a gap between the amount of entanglement and
the amount of purely nonclassical correlations in a quantum system. This gap, I
suggest, can be filled by quantum discord. I calculate it in a typical instance
of the DQC1 circuit and find that the amount of discord is a constant fraction
of the maximum possible discord for a system of that size. This allows an
interpretation of quantum discord as the resource that drives mixed-state
quantum computation. I also study quantum discord as a quantity of independent
interest. Its role in the phenomenon of entanglement distribution is studied
through an easily comprehensible example.
  This thesis also contains discussions on the relation between the complexity
classes P, BQP and DQC1. Additional material is presented on the connections
between the DQC1 model, Jones polynomials and statistical mechanics. The thesis
concludes with a discussion of a few open problems related to the DQC1 model,

amount of information it is possible to send through various types of
communication channels, and to understand the encoding methods that will allow
one to achieve such limits. An early surprise in the study of \textit{quantum}
information theory was the discovery of dense coding, which demonstrated that
it is possible to achieve higher rates for communicating classical information
by transmitting quantum systems, rather than classical ones. To achieve the
highest possible rate, the transmitted quantum system must initially be
maximally entangled with another that is held by the receiver, and the sender
can achieve this rate by encoding her messages with unitary operations. The
situation where these two systems are not maximally entangled has been
intensively studied in recent years, and to date it has appeared as though
unitary encoding might well be optimal in all cases. Indeed, this optimality of
unitary operations for quantum communication protocols has been found to hold
under far more general conditions, extending well beyond the special case of
dense coding. Nonetheless, we here present strong numerical evidence supported
by analytical arguments that indicate there exist circumstances under which one
can encode strictly more classical information using dense coding with
non-unitary, as opposed to unitary, operations.

invariance technique with the point canonical transformation method in a novel
way. It consists in employing our previous knowledge of the PDM problem energy

seam of level crossings of the system is a circle in parameter space of the
anisotropic coupling and the transverse magnetic field, which is identical to
the disorder line of an one-dimensional XY model. The entanglement of the
ground state changes abruptly as the parameters vary across the circle except
specific points crossing to the straight line of the zero magnetic field. At
those points the entanglement does not change but the ground state changes
suddenly. This is an counter example that the entanglement is not alway a good
indicator to quantum phase transitions. The rotation of the circle about an
axis of the parameter space produces the magnetic monopole sphere like a
conducting sphere of electrical charges. The ground state evolving
adiabatically outside the sphere acquires a geometric phase, whereas the ground
state traveling inside the sphere gets no geometric phase. The system also has

trajectory techniques for the propagation of wave packets, Complex WKB and
BOMCA. Complex WKB is derived using a standard saddle point approximation of
the path integral, but taking into account the hbar dependence of both the
amplitude and the phase of the intial wave function, thus giving rise to the
need for complex classical trajectories. BOMCA is derived using a modification
of the saddle point technique, in which the path integral is approximated by
expanding around a near-classical path, chosen so that up to some predetermined
order there is no need to add any correction terms to the leading order
approximation. Both Complex WKB and BOMCA give the same leading order
approximation; in Complex WKB higher accuracy is achieved by adding correction
terms, while in BOMCA no additional terms are ever added -higher accuracy is
achieved by changing the path along which the original approximation is
computed. The path integral derivation of the methods explains the need to
incorporate contributions from more than one trajectory, as observed in
previous numerical work. On the other hand, it emerges that the methods provide
efficient schemes for computing the higher order terms in the asymptotic
evaluation of path integrals. The understanding we develop of BOMCA suggests
that there should exist near-classical trajectories that give exact quantum
dynamical results when used in the computation of the path integral keeping
just the leading order term. We also apply our path integral techniques to give
a compact derivation of the semiclassical approximation to the coherent state
propagator.

between dressed states of a two-level atom located inside a microscopic cavity
engineered in a photonic band-gap material. We distinguish between threshold
and thresholdless behaves by analyzing the Mandel's Q parameter for the cavity
field. We find that the threshold behave depends on whether the spontaneous
emission is or is not present on the lasing transition. In the presence of the
spontaneous emission, the mean photon number of the cavity field exhibits
threshold behavior indicating that the system may operate as an ordinary laser.
When the spontaneous emission is eliminated on the lasing transition, no
threshold is observed for all values of the pumping rate indicating the system
becomes a thresholdless laser. Moreover, we find that under a thresholdless
operation, the mean photon number can increase nonlinearly with the pumping
rate, and this process is accompanied by a sub-Poisson statistics of the field.
This suggests that the nonclassical statistics can be used to distinguish a
nonlinear operation of the dressed-atom laser.

ability to maintain the quantum computer in the ground state of the evolution
Hamiltonian. The computation process has to be sufficiently slow as restricted
by the minimal energy gap. However, at finite temperatures, it might need to be
fast enough to avoid thermal excitations. The question is, how fast does it
need to be? The structure of evolution Hamiltonians for AQC is generally too
complicated for answering this question. Here we model an adiabatic quantum
computer as a (parametrically driven) harmonic oscillator. The advantages of
this model are (1) it offers high flexibility for quantitative analysis on the
thermal effect, (2) the results qualitatively agree with previous numerical

backaction induced by the capacitive coupling between the DQD and the MR. The
DQD is excited by a microwave field and afterwards a tunneling event results in
the decay of the excited state of the DQD. An important advantage of this
system is that both the energy level splitting and the decay rate of the DQD
can be well tuned by varying the gate voltage. We find that the steady average
occupancy, below unity, of the MR can be achieved by changing both the decay
rate of the excited state and the detuning between the transition frequency of
the DQD and the microwave frequency, in analogy to the laser sideband cooling
of an atom or trapped ion in atomic physics. Our results show that the cooling

n-partite entanglement and not e.g. bipartite entanglement. We then show that
this n-partite entanglement can be increased by stochastic local operations and
classical communication to the purest maximal entangled states. However, pure
n-partite entanglement cannot be distilled, consequently all entangled states
in the simplex are n-partite bound entangled. We study also Bell inequalities

They are interpreted geometrically following Candelas and Deutsch (1979) as

a violation of Bohr's complementarity principle between interference visibility
and which-path information in a two-path interferometer. We have reproduced
this experiment, using true single-photon pulses propagating in a two-path
wavefront- splitting interferometer realized with a Fresnel's biprism, and
followed by a grating with adjustable transmitting slits. The measured values
of interference visibility V and which-path information, characterized by the
distinguishability parameter D, are found to obey the complementarity relation
V^2+D^2=&lt;1. This result demonstrates that the experiment can be perfectly
explained by the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.

well understood from its theoretical as well as experimental side, the long
time tail of the very same systems has neither been measured experimentally nor
is there a theoretical agreement on how to handle it. We suggest a possible way
out of this unsatisfactory state of art. Theoretically we suggest that the
correct spectral function entering the Fock-Krylov method to calculate the
survival amplitude is proportional to the density of states of a resonance. The
latter is essentially the energy derivative of a phase shift. As a bonus, we
can connect the survival probability to scattering data via the phase shift.
The method then not only establishes the spectral function, but is per se a
semi-empirical method to extract the large time behaviour from scattering data.

Hardy's test [Hardy, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{68}, 2981 (1992)] and the CHSH

Las Vegas type definitions. In particular, we show that for some marked state
the two types of hitting time are of the same order in both the classical and
the quantum case.
  Further, we prove that for any reversible ergodic Markov chain $P$, the
quantum hitting time of the quantum analogue of $P$ has the same order as the
square root of the classical hitting time of $P$. We also investigate the
(im)possibility of achieving a gap greater than quadratic using an alternative

  Finally, we present new quantum algorithms for the detection and finding

potentially smaller, quantum hitting times. The detection algorithm is based on
phase estimation and is particularly simple. The finding algorithm combines a
similar phase estimation based procedure with ideas of Tulsi from his recent

frequencies are different, the free PU oscillator has a pure point spectrum
that is dense everywhere. When the frequencies are equal, the spectrum is
continuous. It is not bounded from below, running from minus to plus infinity,
but this is not disastrous as the Hamiltonian is still Hermitian and the
evolution operator is still unitary. Generically, the inclusion of interaction
terms breaks unitarity, but in some special cases unitarity is preserved. We
discuss also the nonstandard realization of the PU oscillator suggested by
Bender and Mannheim, where the spectrum of the free Hamiltonian is positive

With this model, fractionization of the vacuum charge has been illustrated in
the literature by showing that the external potential can change the vacuum
charge from zero to a fractional number. Charge conservation then appears
violated in this process. This is because the charge that has been examined in
this context is only a part of the total charge of the vacuum. The total charge
is conserved. It is not fractionalized unless the Dirac equation has a zero

superposition of composite prospects, including many incorporated intentions,
which allows us to explain a variety of interesting fallacies and anomalies

classical systems the temperature behaves as an intensive magnitude, a

see that under some conditions the description of the blocks as thermal states
with the same global temperature as the whole chain fails. We analyze this
issue by employing the quantum fidelity as a figure of merit, singling out in
detail the departure from the classical behavior. The influence in this sense
of zero-temperature quantum phase transitions can be clearly observed within
this approach. Then we show that the blocks can be considered indeed as thermal
states with a high fidelity, provided an effective local temperature is
properly identified. Such a result originates from typical properties of
reduced sub-systems of energy-constrained Hilbert spaces. Finally, the relation
between local and global temperature is analyzed as a function of the size of

two-qubit coupling strengths. Indeed, the maximum fidelity $F_{\rm max}$
between the stationary entangled state, $\rho_{\infty}$, and the
maximally-entangled state, $\rho_m$, can be about $2/3\approx\max\{{\rm
tr}(\rho_{\infty}\rho_m)\}=F_{\rm max}$, corresponding to a maximum stationary
concurrence, $C_{\rm max}$, of about $1/3\approx C(\rho_{\infty})=C_{\rm max}$.
This is significant because the quantum entanglement of the two-qubit system
can be protected, even for a long time. We apply our proposal to several types
of two-qubit superconducting circuits, and show how the entanglement of these
two-qubit circuits can be optimized by varying experimentally-controllable
parameters.

dispersive interactions with several optical frequencies. A judicious choice of
optical parameters enables optimization of an interferometric detection scheme
that suppresses inhomogeneous light shifts and keeps the interferometer
operating in a balanced mode that minimizes technical noise. We show that when
the atoms interact with two-frequency light tuned to cycling transitions the
degree of spin squeezing $\xi^2$ scales as $\xi^2\sim 1/d$ where $d$ is the
resonant optical depth of the ensemble. In real alkali atoms there are loss
channels and the scaling may be closer to $\xi^2\sim 1/\sqrt d.$ Nevertheless
the use of two-frequencies provides a significant improvement in the degree of
squeezing attainable as we show by quantitative analysis of non-resonant

Mach-Zehnder interferometer that uses spatial interference, and an interaction
with multi-frequency amplitude modulated light that does not require a spatial

projective line over the smallest ring of ternions. Both the fundamental

(3+1) of space-time and the arrow of time are outlined. Some other conceptual
implications of this speculative model (like a hierarchical structure of

classical particles get reflected only at upward steps. The conditions for this
effect are that the wave length is much greater than the width of the potential
step and the kinetic energy of the particle is much smaller than the depth of
the potential step. This phenomenon is suggested by non-normalizable solutions
to the time-independent Schroedinger equation, and we present evidence,
numerical and mathematical, that it is also indeed predicted by the
time-dependent Schroedinger equation. Furthermore, this paradoxical reflection
effect suggests, and we confirm mathematically, that a quantum particle can be
trapped for a long time (though not forever) in a region surrounded by downward
potential steps, that is, on a plateau.

that the improved dynamics has the correct classical limit. The effective
Hamiltonian for the quantum cosmological model with a massless scalar field is
thus obtained, which incorporates also the next to leading order quantum
corrections. The possibility that the higher order correction terms may lead to
significant departure from the leading order effective scenario is revealed. If
the semiclassicality of the model is maintained in the large scale limit, there
are great possibilities for $k=0$ Friedmann expanding universe to undergo a

quantum channels. Specifically, we consider memoryless communication scenario
with channel uncertainty which is an analog of compound channel in classical
information theory. We determine the quantum capacity of finite compound
channels and arbitrary compound channels with informed decoder. Our approach in
the finite case is based on the observation that perfect channel knowledge at
the decoder does not increase the capacity of finite quantum compound channels.
As a consequence we obtain coding theorem for finite quantum averaged channels,
the simplest class of channels with long-term memory. The extension of these
results to quantum compound channels with uninformed encoder and decoder, and
infinitely many constituents remains an open problem.

a microcavity containing an inhomogeneously broadened quantum dots ensemble,
the cavity mode appears as a positive peak with a linewidth that reflects the
mode quality factor Q. We show in this article that this conclusion is in
general not true, and that the measured mode linewidth depends strongly on the
excitation power for microcavities having large Purcell factors. We analyze
theoretically this effect in the case of the micropillar cavity and we show
that the same microcavity can give rise to a large variety of photoluminescence
spectral signatures depending on the excitation power and collection set-up. We
finally give guidelines to measure the real cavity quality factor by
photoluminescence.

the sense that the equations of motion take a form identical to that of unitary
motion, but with different boundary conditions. When the constrained subspace

We give examples for two kinds of polarizers. The first kind presents an

total reflection at the interface with a birefringent medium. Using the Stokes
vector representation, we determine explicitly the trajectories of the wave
light polarization during the polarization process. We find that such
trajectories are not always geodesics of the Poincar\'e sphere as it is usually
thought. Using the analogy between light polarization and special relativity,
we find that the action of successive polarizers on the light wave polarization
is equivalent to the action of a single resulting polarizer followed by a
rotation achieved for example by a device with optical activity. We find a
composition law for polarizers similar to the composition law for noncollinear
velocities in special relativity. We define an angle equivalent to the
relativistic Wigner angle which can be used to quantify the quality of two

Moreover, we apply the methods from entanglement distillation protocols based

Furthermore, we study the decoy state methods for other single photon sources,
such as triggering parametric down-conversion (PDC) source.
  We propose a model and post-processing scheme for the entanglement-based QKD

entanglement-based QKD, we emphasize that our generic model may also be useful
for other non-QKD experiments involving a PDC source. By simulating a real PDC

secure distance than the single-photon-based QKD schemes.
  We present a time-shift attack that exploits the efficiency mismatch of two

  Information Science</title><description>  This thesis explores the use of entangled states in quantum computation and
quantum information science. Entanglement, a quantum phenomenon with no
classical counterpart, has been identified as an important and quantifiable
resource in many areas of theoretical quantum information science, including
quantum error correction, quantum cryptography, and quantum algorithms. We
first investigate the equivalence classes of a particular class of entangled
states (known as graph states due to their association with mathematical
graphs) under local operations. We prove that for graph states corresponding to
graphs with neither cycles of length 3 nor 4, the equivalence classes can be
characterized in a very simple way. We also present software for analyzing and
manipulating graph states. We then study quantum error-correcting codes whose
codewords are highly entangled states. An important area of investigation
concerning QECCs is to determine which resources are necessary in order to
carry out any computation on the code to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, while
simultaneously maintaining a high degree of resistance to noise. We prove that
transversal gates, which are designed to prevent the propagation of errors
through a system, are insufficient to achieve universal computation on almost
all QECCs. Finally, we study the problem of creating efficient quantum circuits
for creating entangling measurements. Entangling measurements can be used to
harness the apparent extra computing power of quantum systems by allowing us to
extract information about the global, collective properties of a quantum state
using local measurements. We construct explicit quantum circuits that create
entangling measurements, and show that these circuits scale polynomially in the
input parameters.

coupled qubit system, such that the system at an initial time evolves to a
state in which a given measurement corresponds to the desired operation. This
can be thought of as a quantum neural network. We first apply the method to a
system of two coupled superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs),
and demonstrate learning of both the classical gates XOR and XNOR. Training of
the phase produces a gate congruent to the CNOT modulo a phase shift. Striking
out for somewhat more interesting territory, we attempt learning of an
entanglement witness for a two qubit system. Simulation shows a reasonably
successful mapping of the entanglement at the initial time onto the correlation
function at the final time for both pure and mixed states. For pure states this
mapping requires knowledge of the phase relation between the two parts;
however, given that knowledge, this method can be used to measure the

  superoperators and comparison of the existing models</title><description>  Time development of electromagnetic fields in closed cavities under
continuous detection of photons continues to be a subject of confusing
controversy. Recently Dodonov et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 75, 013806, 2007] argued
that their model of quantum superoperators (E model) invalidates some of the
predictions of the previously introduced photon counting model of Srinivas and
Davies [J. Mod. Optic. 28, 981, 1981] (SD model). Both the SD and the E models
are based on two postulated quantum jump superoperators: (1) the one-count
operator corresponding to the absorption of a single photon and (2) the
no-count operator. In this work we develop a stochastic difference equation
that describes the dissipative coupling of the cavity field and the detector.
The difference equation is based on non-perturbative treatment of the
cavity-detector coupling. In spite of being non-integrable due to the coupling
of the detector with an external reservoir it can be used to derive the exact
forms of the quantum jump superoperators. When applied to a particular photon
counting measurement our theory gives predictions identical with those of the
SD model which should be considered a non-perturbative and ab-initio result. It
is pointed out that available experimental results coincide with the results
given by the ab-initio SD model. We summarize some of the key characteristics
of cavity fields and photon counting processes to demonstrate that the results
given by the SD model are consistent with the principles of quantum mechanics
while those given by the E model are not.

After laser preparation of the Rydberg atoms, dipole-dipole coupling excites
the 49s atoms in one cylinder to the 49p state while the 41d atoms in the
second cylinder are transferred down to the 42p state. The energy exchanged
between the atoms in this process is 33 GHz. An external rf-field brings this
energy transfer into resonance. The strength of the interaction has been
investigated as a function of amplitude (0-1 V/cm) and frequency (1-30 MHz) of
the rf-field and as a function of a static field offset. Multi-photon
transitions up to fifth order as well as selection rules prohibiting the
process at certain fields have been observed. The width of the resonances has
been reduced compared to earlier results by switching off external magnetic
fields of the magneto-optical trap, making sub-MHz spectroscopy possible. All

ac-Stark shift due to the rf-field into account.

Power laws of the strongest squeezing and the optimal coupling with particle

oscillator-cavity model. This overcomes the known difficulties of achieving
high quantum input-output fidelity with storage times long compared to the
input signal duration. We use a generic model of the memory response, which is
applicable to any linear storage medium ranging from a superconducting device
to an atomic medium. The temporal switching or gating of the device may either
be through a control field changing the coupling, or through a variable
detuning approach, as in more recent quantum memory experiments. An exact
calculation of the temporal memory response to an external input is carried
out. This shows that there is a mode-matching criterion which determines the
optimum input and output mode shape. This optimum pulse shape can be modified
by changing the gate characteristics. In addition, there is a critical coupling
between the atoms and the cavity that allows high fidelity in the presence of
long storage times. The quantum fidelity is calculated both for the coherent
state protocol, and for a completely arbitrary input state with a bounded total
photon number. We show how a dynamical quantum memory can surpass the relevant
classical memory bound, while retaining a relatively long storage time.

the Hamiltonian involved must have local structure, which leads to a result
about eigenvalue gaps from information theory. I also improve results about

uses a new method for bringing the state back to the ansatz after each
imaginary time step. I then use it to investigate the phase transition in the

conflict between the empirically verified predictions of quantum theory and the
notion of local causality that is motivated by relativity theory. Yet many
physicists continue to accept, usually on the reports of textbook writers and
other commentators, that Bell's own view was wrong, and that, in fact, the
theorem only brings out a conflict with determinism or the hidden-variables
program or realism or some other such principle that (unlike local causality),
allegedly, nobody should have believed anyway. (Moreover, typically such
beliefs arise without the person in question even being aware that the view
they are accepting differs so radically from Bell's own.) Here we try to shed
some light on the situation by focusing on the concept of local causality that
is the heart of Bell's theorem, and, in particular, by contrasting Bell's own
understanding with the analysis of Jon Jarrett which has been the most
influential source, in recent decades, for the kinds of claims mentioned
previously. We point out a crucial difference between Jarrett's and Bell's own
understanding of Bell's formulation of local causality, which turns out to be
the basis for the erroneous claim, made by Jarrett and many others, that Bell
misunderstood the implications of his own theorem.

The
technique uses an SU(n) coherent state basis, and can equally be used for
either static or dynamical simulations. We review previously known definitions
and operator identities, and show how these can be used to define an
off-diagonal, positive phase-space representation analogous to the positive
P-function. As an illustration of the phase-space method, we use the example of
the Ising model, which has exact solutions for the finite temperature canonical
ensemble in two dimensions. We show how a canonical ensemble for an Ising model
of arbitrary structure can be efficiently simulated using SU(2) or atomic
coherent states. The technique utilizes a transformation from a canonical
(imaginary-time) weighted simulation to an equivalent unweighted real-time
simulation. The results are compared to the exactly soluble two-dimensional
case. We note that Ising models in one, two or three dimensions are potentially
achievable experimentally as a lattice-gas of ultra-cold atoms in optical
lattices. The technique is not restricted to canonical ensembles or to
Ising-like couplings. It is also able to be used for real-time evolution, and
for systems whose time-evolution follows a master-equation describing
decoherence and coupling to external reservoirs. The case of SU(n) phase-space
is used to describe n-level systems. In general, the requirement that
time-evolution is stochastic corresponds to a restriction to Hamiltonians and
master-equations that are quadratic in the group generators or generalized spin
operators.

space is given, and the distribution of phase space displacements is a
Gaussian. In the limit where the latter becomes flat, we prove analytically
that the maximal classical achievable fidelity (which is 1/2 without squeezing,
for $s=1$) is given by $\sqrt{s}/(1+s)$, vanishing when the degree of squeezing
diverges. For mixed states, as well as for general distributions of

a finite-dimensional semidefinite program, which yields accurate, certifiable
bounds thanks to a rigorous analysis of the truncation error. This approach may
be easily adapted to more general ensembles of input states.

individual qubits. We show how to derive the parameters of the system (fixed

parameters vary linearly with the pulse width, our scheme allows flexibility in
the time scales under which qubits evolve. Unlike quantum spin networks, our
scheme allows the transmission of several quantum states at a time, requiring
only a two qubit separation between quantum states. By pulsing the biases of
several qubits at the same time, we show that only eight bias control lines are
required to achieve state transfer along a channel of arbitrary length.
Furthermore, when the information to be transferred is purely classical in
nature, only three bias control lines are required, greatly simplifying the

the violation holds true even for simpler states, such as multipartite GHZ

practical multipartite Bell tests by analyzing the increase of the robustness
to noise with the number of modes. In view of the high efficiency achievable
with homodyne detection, our results thus open a possible way to feasible
loophole-free Bell tests that are robust to experimental imperfections. We
provide an explicit example of a three-mode state (a superposition of coherent

By applying the explanations of heat transferred and work performed at the
quantum level in Kieu's work [PRL, 93, 140403 (2004)], the basic thermodynamic
quantities, i.e., heat transferred, net work done in a cycle and efficiency of
EQHE are investigated in terms of DM interaction and concurrence. The validity
of the second law of thermodynamics is confirmed in the entangled system. It is
found that there is a same efficiency for both antiferromagnetic and
ferromagnetic cases, and the efficiency can be controlled in two manners: 1.
only by spin-spin interaction J and DM interaction D; 2. only by the
temperature T and concurrence C. In order to obtain a positive net work, we
need not entangle all qubits in two two-spin systems and we only require the
entanglement between qubits in a two-spin system not be zero. As the ratio of
entanglement between qubits in two two-spin systems increases, the efficiency
will approach infinitely the classical Carnot one. An interesting phenomenon is
an abrupt transition of the efficiency when the entanglements between qubits in
two two-spin systems are equal.

oscillations of the electromagnetic field, which depends upon the film optical
properties and, in case of deposition onto a substrate, upon the substrate
reflectivity. It has been suggested that this force may be relevant in
determining the stability of deposited pseudomorphic films with respect to
buckling or island formation. We present a detailed analysis of its behaviour
as a function of the optical parameters and of the film thickness and we
illustrate the conditions under which it may play some role. For free standing
films it turns out that the film stabilization is basically due to the surface
stress, which largely overwhelms the vacuum force. For epilayers on metal
substrate the vacuum force may be important, and we give stability diagrams and
critical thicknesses for several cases, illustrating how the flat surface
growth may depend upon the film parameters. The importance of including
retardation effects into the theory for a realistic determination of the
stability conditions is also discussed.

Comparison with the results obtained by adopting a continuum dielectric model

changes in the force intensity with respect to the isotropic plasma model which
range from 40% to few percent depending upon the film electron density and the
film separation. The calculated force shows quantum size oscillations, which
can be significant for film separation distances of several nanometers. The

decoherence with increasing temperature. We also discuss possible effects of

shows that this is uniformly true, in that for every $\epsilon&gt;0$ there exists
a $\delta&gt;0$, independent of the size $N$ of the matrices, for which almost
commuting implies being close to a commuting pair. However, this theorem does
not specify how $\delta$ depends on $\epsilon$. We give uniform bounds relating
$\delta$ and $\epsilon$. We provide tighter bounds in the case of block
tridiagonal and tridiagonal matrices and a fully constructive method in that

approximately measures two approximately commuting operators simultaneously.
Finally, we comment briefly on the case of approximately measuring three or

quantum computers would be no more powerful than classical computers: both

consisting of all problems solvable by a conventional computer using a
polynomial amount of memory. This solves an open problem proposed by one of us
in 2005, and gives an essentially complete understanding of computational
complexity in the presence of CTCs. Following the work of Deutsch, we treat a
CTC as simply a region of spacetime where a &quot;causal consistency&quot; condition is
imposed, meaning that Nature has to produce a (probabilistic or quantum)
fixed-point of some evolution operator. Our conclusion is then a consequence of
the following theorem: given any quantum circuit (not necessarily unitary), a
fixed-point of the circuit can be (implicitly) computed in polynomial space.
This theorem might have independent applications in quantum information.

especially for the ferromagnetic case. The entanglement quality of input states
cannot enhance the mutual information of the quantum channel. When the DM
interaction is large, the mutual information will be the maximum value 2 for a
non-entangled input state, but it is 1 for a maximally entangled input one. It

exceedingly long times due to the constructive role of their non-Markovian
protein-solvent environment. Using a numerically exact approach, we demonstrate
that a slow quantum bath helps to sustain quantum entanglement of two pairs of
Forster coupled excitons, in contrast to a Markovian environment. We consider
the crossover from a fast to a slow bath and from weak to strong dissipation
and show that a slow bath can generate robust entanglement. This persists to
surprisingly high temperatures, even higher than the excitonic gap and is
absent for a Markovian bath.

trap and the wire, reduces the radial magnetic-field gradients and lowers the
trap depth. Measurements of the trap position reveal a complete exclusion of
the magnetic field from the superconducting wire for temperatures lower than
6K. As the temperature is further increased, the magnetic field partially
penetrates the superconducting wire; hence the microtrap position is shifted
towards the position expected for a normal-conducting wire.

`high-order' correlation. This paper elaborates this issue by giving necessary
and sufficient conditions for a pure multipartite state to be locally
undetermined, and moreover, characterizing precisely all the pure states
sharing the same set of reduced states with it. Interestingly, local
determinability of pure states is closely related to a generalized notion of
Schmidt decomposition. Furthermore, we find that locally undetermined states
have some applications to the well-known consensus problem in distributed
computation. To be specific, given some physically separated agents, when
communication between them, either classical or quantum, is unreliable and they
are not allowed to use local ancillary quantum systems, then there exists a
totally correct and completely fault-tolerant protocol for them to reach a
consensus if and only if they share a priori a locally undetermined quantum

trajectories for quantum particles in a curved background space-time containing
a spacelike singularity. As an example of such a metric we use the
Schwarzschild metric, which contains two spacelike singularities, one in the
past and one in the future. Since the particle world lines are everywhere
timelike or lightlike, particles can be annihilated but not created at a future
spacelike singularity, and created but not annihilated at a past spacelike
singularity. It is argued that in the presence of future (past) spacelike
singularities, there is a unique natural Bohm-like evolution law directed to
the future (past). This law differs from the one in non-singular space-times
mainly in two ways: it involves Fock space since the particle number is not
conserved, and the wave function is replaced by a density matrix. In
particular, we determine the evolution equation for the density matrix, a
pure-to-mixed evolution equation of a quasi-Lindblad form. We have to leave
open whether a curvature cut-off needs to be introduced for this equation to be
well defined.

the CWS framework to the nonbinary case (of both prime and nonprime dimension)

that while the additivity properties of nonbinary CWS codes are similar to the

substantially from the binary case, even for prime dimensions. In particular,
we identify specific structure patterns of stabilizer groups, based on which
efficient constructions might be possible for codes that encode more dimensions

cannot be applied in the binary case. Understanding of these structural

describe them. In all sciences, besides quantum physics, all correlations are
described by either of two mechanisms. Either a first event influences a second
one by sending some information encoded in bosons or molecules or other
physical carriers, depending on the particular science. Or the correlated
events have some common causes in their common past. Interestingly, quantum
physics predicts an entirely different kind of cause for some correlations,
named entanglement. This new kind of cause reveals itself, e.g., in
correlations that violate Bell inequalities (hence cannot be described by
common causes) between space-like separated events (hence cannot be described
by classical communication). Einstein branded it as spooky action at a
distance. A real spooky action at a distance would require a faster than light
influence defined in some hypothetical universally privileged reference frame.
Here we put stringent experimental bounds on the speed of all such hypothetical
influences. We performed a Bell test during more than 24 hours between two
villages separated by 18 km and approximately east-west oriented, with the
source located precisely in the middle. We continuously observed 2-photon
interferences well above the Bell inequality threshold. Taking advantage of the
Earth's rotation, the configuration of our experiment allowed us to determine,
for any hypothetically privileged frame, a lower bound for the speed of this
spooky influence. For instance, if such a privileged reference frame exists and
is such that the Earth's speed in this frame is less than 10^-3 that of the
speed of light, then the speed of this spooky influence would have to exceed
that of light by at least 4 orders of magnitude.

but an interesting resource for information processing, for instance in
communication-complexity theory or cryptography. An important question in this
context is whether the resource can be distilled: Given a large amount of weak
non-local correlations, is there a method to obtain strong non-locality using
local operations and shared randomness? We partly answer this question by no:
CHSH-type non-locality, the only possible non-locality of binary systems, which
is not super-strong, but achievable by measurements on certain quantum states,
has at best very limited distillability by any non-interactive classical
method. This strongly extends and generalizes what was previously known, namely
that there are two limits that cannot be overstepped: The Bell and Tsirelson
bounds. Moreover, our results imply that there must be an infinite number of
such bounds.
  A noticeable feature of our proof of this purely classical statement is that
it is quantum mechanical in the sense that (both novel and known) facts from
quantum theory are used in a crucial way to obtain the claimed results. One of
these results, of independent interest, is that certain mixed entangled states
cannot be distilled without communication. Weaker statements, namely limited
distillability, have been known for Werner states.

  calculated with two methods&quot;</title><description>  There are two alternative methods used in literature to calculate the
incoherent part of the spectrum of light scattered by an atomic system. In the
first, one calculates the spectrum of the total light scattered by the system
and obtains the incoherent part by subtracting the coherent part. In the second
method, one introduces the fluctuation operators and obtains the incoherent
part of the spectrum by taking the Fourier transform of the two time
correlation function of the fluctuation operators. These two methods have been
recognized for years as two completely equivalent for evaluating the incoherent
part of the spectrum. In a recent paper Qing Xu et al. [Phys. Rev. A 78, 013407
(2008)] have shown that there are discrepancies between the incoherent parts of
the stationary spectrum of a three-level Lambda-type system calculated with
these two methods. The predicted discrepancies can be severe that over a wide
rage of the Rabi frequencies and atomic decay rates, the spectrum calculated
with the variance method can have negative values. This is obviously unphysical
result since the fluorescence spectrum is a positively defined quantity. It
represents the frequency distribution of light incoherently scattered by the
atomic system. Therefore, the calculated spectrum should be positive for all
frequencies independent of values of the Rabi frequencies and the damping
rates. In this comment, we show that there are no discrepancies between these
two methods. The equivalence of these two alternative methods leads to the same
incoherent spectra that are positive for all frequencies independent of values
of the parameters involved. The analytical analysis is supported by simple
numerical calculations.

memory for photons at telecommunication wavelengths. The implementation of
quantum memory proposals in rare earth ion doped solids require spectral
tailoring of the inhomogeneous absorption profile by efficient population
transfer between ground state levels (spin polarization) using optical pumping.
In this article we investigate the limiting factors of efficient optical
pumping between ground state Zeeman levels in an erbium doped Y2SiO5 crystal.
We introduce two methods to overcome these limiting factors: stimulated
emission using a second laser and spin mixing using radio frequency excitation.
Both methods significantly improve the degree of spin polarization. Population
transfer between two Zeeman levels with less than 10 % of the total population
in the initial ground state is achieved, corresponding to a spin polarization
greater than 90 %. In addition, we demonstrate spectral tailoring by isolating
a narrow absorption peak within a large transparency window.

One potential explanation for this, the one considered here, is that the wave
function collapses down to just one version. The experimental situation is
briefly reviewed, with no evidence found for collapse. The theoretical position
is also reviewed and found wanting. Collapse-by-observation schemes are
logically untenable. A mathematical theory of collapse must be nonlinear, a
significant departure from current quantum theory. In addition, the primary
candidate theory, the GRW-Pearle model, requires instantaneous, non-local
transmission of information. It also requires transmission of information
across versions of reality, which is forbidden in current quantum mechanics.
And there is no apparent physical quantity, such as particle number, that can
provide the mechanism for collapse in all cases. Further, these aspects, which
are in disagreement with current theory, seem to be necessary for any
mathematical theory of collapse. The conclusion is that the outlook for
mathematical collapse schemes is not encouraging.

through the lattice. The effect is responsible for a wealth of non-equilibrium
phenomena, and has been exploited to transmit quantum information through spin
chains. It is a commonly expressed belief that for local Hamiltonians, any such
propagation happens at a finite &quot;speed of sound&quot;. Indeed, the Lieb-Robinson
theorem states that in spin models, all effects caused by a perturbation are
limited to a causal cone defined by a constant speed, up to exponentially small
corrections. In this work we show that for translationally invariant bosonic
models with nearest-neighbor interactions, this belief is incorrect: We prove
that one can encounter excitations which accelerate under the natural dynamics
of the lattice and allow for reliable transmission of information faster than
any finite speed of sound. The effect is only limited by the model's range of
validity (eventually by relativity). It also implies that in non-equilibrium
dynamics of strongly correlated bosonic models far-away regions may become
quickly entangled, suggesting that their simulation may be much harder than
that of spin chains even in the low energy sector.

two-atom entanglement appears with periodicity without considering phase
decoherence, however, the phase decoherence causes the decay of entanglement
between two atoms, with the increasing of the phase decoherence coefficient,
the entanglement will quickly become a constant value, which is affected by the
two-atom initial state, Meanwhile the two-atom quantum state will forever stay
in the maximal entangled state when the initial state is proper even in the
presence of phase decoherence. On the other hand, the Bell violation and the
entanglement does not satisfy the monotonous relation, a large Bell violation
implies the presence of a large amount of entanglement under certain

the Coxeter sub-geometry is found to be intricately related to the

system is prepared in various ways and a range of measurements are performed.
For each measurement M and preparation rho the experimenter can determine,
given enough time, the probability of a given outcome a: p(a|M,rho). How large
does the Hilbert space of the quantum system have to be in order to allow us to
find density matrices and measurement operators that will reproduce the given
probability distribution? In this note, we prove a simple lower bound for the
dimension of the Hilbert space. The main insight is to relate this problem to
the construction of quantum random access codes, for which interesting bounds
on Hilbert space dimension already exist. We discuss several applications of
our result to hidden variable, or ontological models, to Bell inequalities and
to properties of the smooth min-entropy.

boundary conditions may attract or repel a piston in the neck of a flask-like
container. Using the world-line formalism this behavior is related to the
competing contribution to the interaction energy of two types of Brownian
bridges. It qualitatively is also expected from attractive long-range two-body
forces between constituents of the boundary. A geometric subtraction scheme is
presented that avoids divergent contributions to the interaction energy and
classifies the Brownian bridges that contribute to the force. These are all of
finite length and the Casimir force can be analyzed and in principle accurately
computed without resorting to regularization or analytic continuation. The
world-line analysis is robust with respect to variations in the shape of the
piston and the flask and the analogy with long-range forces suggests that
neutral atoms and particles are also drawn into open-ended pipes (or
nano-tubes) by Casimir forces of electromagnetic origin.

implementing a quantum information processor (QIP) is an important task for
both comparing different devices and assessing a device's prospects with
regards to achieving fault-tolerant quantum control. We implement in a
liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance QIP the randomized benchmarking
protocol presented by Knill et al (PRA 77: 012307 (2008)). We report an error
per randomized $\frac{\pi}{2}$ pulse of $1.3 \pm 0.1 \times 10^{-4}$ with a
single qubit QIP and show an experimentally relevant error model where the
randomized benchmarking gives a signature fidelity decay which is not possible
to interpret as a single error per gate. We explore and experimentally
investigate multi-qubit extensions of this protocol and report an average error
rate for one and two qubit gates of $4.7 \pm 0.3 \times 10^{-3}$ for a three
qubit QIP. We estimate that these error rates are still not decoherence limited
and thus can be improved with modifications to the control hardware and
software.

Individual constituents interact mainly with their few nearest neighbors. This
locality of interactions is inherited by a decay of correlation functions, but
also reflected by scaling laws of a quite profound quantity: The entanglement
entropy of ground states. This entropy of the reduced state of a subregion
often merely grows like the boundary area of the subregion, and not like its
volume, in sharp contrast with an expected extensive behavior. Such &quot;area laws&quot;
for the entanglement entropy and related quantities have received considerable
attention in recent years. They emerge in several seemingly unrelated fields,
in the context of black hole physics, quantum information science, and quantum
many-body physics where they have important implications on the numerical
simulation of lattice models. In this Colloquium we review the current status
of area laws in these fields. Center stage is taken by rigorous results on
lattice models in one and higher spatial dimensions. The differences and
similarities between bosonic and fermionic models are stressed, area laws are
related to the velocity of information propagation, and disordered systems,
non-equilibrium situations, classical correlation concepts, and topological
entanglement entropies are discussed. A significant proportion of the article
is devoted to the quantitative connection between the entanglement content of
states and the possibility of their efficient numerical simulation. We discuss
matrix-product states, higher-dimensional analogues, and states from
entanglement renormalization and conclude by highlighting the implications of
area laws on quantifying the effective degrees of freedom that need to be
considered in simulations.

which characterize the state uniquely. Furthermore we show how these states can

  the Human Brain</title><description>  The feasibility of wave function collapse in the human brain has been the
subject of vigorous scientific debates since the advent of quantum theory.
Scientists like Von Neumann, London, Bauer and Wigner (initially) believed that
wave function collapse occurs in the brain or is caused by the mind of the
observer. It is a legitimate question to ask how human brain can receive subtle
external visual quantum information intact when it must pass through very noisy
and complex pathways from the eye to the brain? There are several approaches to
investigate information processing in the brain, each of which presents a
different set of conclusions. Penrose and Hameroff have hypothesized that there
is quantum information processing inside the human brain whose material
substrate involves microtubules and consciousness is the result of a collective
wavefunction collapse occurring in these structures. Conversely, Tegmark stated
that owing to thermal decoherence there cannot be any quantum processing in
neurons of the brain and processing in the brain must be classical for
cognitive processes. However, Rosa and Faber presented an argument for a middle
way which shows that none of the previous authors are completely right and
despite the presence of decoherence, it is still possible to consider the brain
to be a quantum system. Additionally, Thaheld, has concluded that quantum
states of photons do collapse in the human eye and there is no possibility for
collapse of visual quantum states in the brain and thus there is no possibility
for the quantum state reduction in the brain. In this paper we conclude that if
we accept the main essence of the above approaches taken together, each of them
can provide a different part of a teleportation mechanism.

discrimination, in which a set of quantum gates on a $d-$dimensional system are
perfectly discriminated with assistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla system.
The main contribution of the present paper is two-fold: (1) The number of
quantum gates that can be discriminated in this scheme is evaluated. We prove
that any $rd+1$ quantum gates cannot be perfectly discriminated with assistance
from the ancilla, and there exist $rd$ quantum gates which can be perfectly
discriminated with assistance from the ancilla. (2) The dimensionality of the
minimal ancilla system is estimated. We prove that there exists a constant
positive number $c$ such that for any $k\leq cr$ quantum gates, if they are
$d$-assisted discriminable, then they are also $r$-assisted discriminable, and
there are $c^{\prime}r\textrm{}(c^{\prime}&gt;c)$ different quantum gates which
can be discriminated with a $d-$dimensional ancilla, but they cannot be
discriminated if the ancilla is reduced to an $r-$dimensional system. Thus, the
order $O(r)$ of the number of quantum gates that can be discriminated with
assistance from an $r-$dimensional ancilla is optimal. The results reported in
this paper represent a preliminary step toward understanding the role ancilla
system plays in discrimination of quantum gates as well as the power and limit
of superdense coding.

derived. Contractions of product density operators of systems of identical
fermions and bosons are proved to be asymptotically equivalent to,
respectively, antisymmetric and symmetric products of density operators of a

equivalence relation is defined in terms of the thermodynamic limit of
expectation values of observables in the states represented by given density

assumption that, as seen from a complexity theoretic perspective, the universe
is not an exponential place. A fact that disallows such a derivation is the
existence of {\em polynomial superluminal} gates, hypothetical primitive
operations that enable superluminal signaling but not the efficient solution of
intractable problems. It therefore follows, if this assumption is a basic
principle of physics, either that it must be supplemented with additional
assumptions to prohibit such gates, or, improbably, that no-signaling is not a
universal condition. Yet, a gate of this kind is possibly implicit, though not
recognized as such, in a decade-old quantum optical experiment involving
position-momentum entangled photons. Here we describe a feasible modified
version experiment that appears to explicitly demonstrate the action of this
gate. Some obvious counter-claims are shown to be invalid. We believe that the
unexpected possibility of polynomial superluminal operations arises because
some practically measured quantum optical quantities are not describable as
standard quantum mechanical observables.

position with the pendulum's bob above the pivot rather than below it. This
surprising and counterintuitive phenomenon is a widespread feature of driven
systems and carries over into the quantum world. Even when the static
properties of a quantum system are known, its response to an explicitly
time-dependent variation of its parameters may be highly nontrivial, and
qualitatively new states can appear that were absent in the original system. In
quantum mechanics the archetype for this kind of behaviour is an atom in a
radiation field, which exhibits a number of fundamental phenomena such as the
modification of its g-factor in a radio-frequency field and the dipole force
acting on an atom moving in a spatially varying light field. These effects can
be successfully described in the so-called dressed atom picture. Here we show
that the concept of dressing can also be applied to macroscopic matter waves,
and that the quantum states of &quot;dressed matter waves&quot; can be coherently
controlled. In our experiments we use Bose-Einstein condensates in driven
optical lattices and demonstrate that the many-body state of this system can be
adiabatically and reversibly changed between a superfluid and a Mott insulating
state by varying the amplitude of the driving. Our setup represents a versatile
testing ground for driven quantum systems, and our results indicate the
direction towards new quantum control schemes for matter waves.

In the one-electron case, with different Zeeman splittings in the two dots, the

oscillatory current through the QPC. In the two-electron case, the readout of
the spin state of the electron in one of the dots called the qubit dot is
essentially similar after considering hyperfine interactions between the

  their decoherence</title><description>  The state of a microscopic system encodes its complete quantum description,
from which the probabilities of all measurement outcomes are inferred. Being a
statistical concept, the state cannot be obtained from a single system
realization. It can be reconstructed from an ensemble of copies, by performing
measurements on different realizations. Reconstructing the state of a set of
trapped particles shielded from their environment is an important step for the
investigation of the quantum to classical boundary. While trapped atom state
reconstructions have been achieved, it is challenging to perform similar
experiments with trapped photons which require cavities storing light for very
long times. Here, we report the complete reconstruction and pictorial
representation of a variety of radiation states trapped in a cavity in which
several photons survive long enough to be repeatedly measured. Information is
extracted from the field by atoms crossing the cavity one by one. We exhibit a
gallery of pictures featuring coherent states, Fock states with a definite
photon number and Schrodinger cat states which are superpositions of coherent
states with different phases. These states are equivalently represented by
their density matrices in the photon-number basis or by their Wigner functions,
which are distributions of the field complex amplitude. Quasi-classical
coherent states have a Gaussian-shaped Wigner function while Fock and
Schrodinger cat Wigner functions show oscillations and negativities revealing
quantum interferences. Cavity damping induces decoherence which quickly washes
out the Wigner functions oscillations. We observe this process and realize
movies of decoherence by reconstructing snapshots of Schrodinger cat states at
successive times.

deduced resorting to the comparison between the Maxwell--Boltzmann velocity
distribution function and the density profile in momentum space. Though a
successful method it is an approximation, since it also implies the use of
classical statistical mechanics at temperatures close to the condensation

This experimental value shall be compared against the result here calculated,
using the Bose--Einstein distribution function, which is a

be represented as a point of the unit sphere S in the Hilbert space of
square-integrable functions. If the density function depends smoothly on a set
of parameters, the image of the map forms a Riemannian submanifold M in S. The
metric on M induced by the ambient spherical geometry of S is the Fisher
information matrix. Statistical properties of the system modelled by a
parametric density function p can then be expressed in terms of information
geometry. An elementary introduction to information geometry is presented,
followed by a precise geometric characterisation of the family of Gaussian
density functions. When the parametric density function describes the
equilibrium state of a physical system, certain physical characteristics can be
identified with geometric features of the associated information manifold M.
Applying this idea, the properties of vapour-liquid phase transitions are
elucidated in geometrical terms. For an ideal gas, phase transitions are absent
and the geometry of M is flat. In this case, the solutions to the geodesic
equations yield the adiabatic equations of state. For a van der Waals gas, the
associated geometry of M is highly nontrivial. The scalar curvature of M
diverges along the spinodal boundary which envelopes the unphysical region in
the phase diagram. The curvature is thus closely related to the stability of
the system.

to quantum computing systems. We show that ground-state and time-dependent
density functional theory can be applied to quantum computing systems by
proving the Hohenberg-Kohn and Runge-Gross theorems for a fermionic
representation of an N qubit system. As a first demonstration of this approach,
time-dependent density functional theory is used to determine the minimum
energy gap Delta(N) arising when the quantum adiabatic evolution algorithm is
used to solve instances of the NP-Complete problem MAXCUT. It is known that the
computational efficiency of this algorithm is largely determined by the large-N
scaling behavior of Delta(N), and so determining this behavior is of
fundamental significance. As density functional theory has been used to study
quantum systems with N ~ 1000 interacting degrees of freedom, the approach
introduced in this paper raises the realistic prospect of evaluating the gap
Delta(N) for systems with N ~ 1000 qubits. Although the calculation of Delta(N)
serves to illustrate how density functional theory methods can be applied to
problems in quantum computing, the approach has a much broader range and shows
promise as a means for determining the properties of very large quantum
computing systems.

  states</title><description>  Interferometry with Heisenberg limited phase resolution may play an important
role in the next generation of atomic clocks, gravitational wave detectors, and
in quantum information science. For experimental implementations the robustness
of the phase resolution is crucial since any experimental realization will be
subject to imperfections. In this article we study the robustness of phase
reconstruction with two number states as input subject to fluctuations in the
state preparation. We find that the phase resolution is insensitive to
fluctuations in the total number of particles and robust against noise in the
number difference at the input. The phase resolution depends on the uncertainty
in the number difference in a universal way that has a clear physical
interpretation: Fundamental noise due to the Heisenberg limit and noise due to
state preparation imperfection contribute essentially independently to the
total uncertainty in the phase. For number difference uncertainties less than
one the first noise source is dominant and the phase resolution is essentially
Heisenberg limited. For number difference uncertainties greater than one the
noise due to state preparation imperfection is dominant and the phase
resolution deteriorates linearly with the number difference uncertainty.

Roncaglia, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 220401 (2008)]. Here we generalize and extend
those results along several directions: We analyze the fate of entanglement for
an environment with a general spectral density providing a complete
characterization of the corresponding phase diagrams for ohmic and sub--ohmic
environments (we also analyze the super-ohmic case showing that for such
environment the expected behavior is rather different). We also generalize
previous studies by considering two different models for the interaction
between the system and the environment (first we analyze the case when the
coupling is through position and then we examine the case where the coupling is
symmetric in position and momentum). Finally, we analyze (both numerically and

the final entanglement is independent of the initial state and may be non-zero
at very low temperatures. We provide a natural interpretation of our results in

mapped into entire functions of a complex variable z*, whereas the creation and
annihilation operators $\hat{a}^\dagger$ and $\hat{a}$ play the role of
multiplication and differentiation with respect to z*, respectively. In this
paper we propose an alternative representation of quantum states, conjugate to
the Bargmann representation, where the roles of $\hat{a}^\dagger$ and $\hat{a}$
are reversed, much like the roles of the position and momentum operators in
their respective representations. We derive expressions for the inner product
that maintain the usual notion of distance between states in the Hilbert space.
Applications to simple systems and to the calculation of semiclassical
propagators are presented.

nonlinear Frenkel-Kontorova chain. We find that the entanglement of solitons
manifests particle-like behavior as they are characterized by localization of
entanglement. The von-Neumann entropy of solitons mixes critical with
noncritical behaviors. Inside the core of the soliton the logarithmic increase
of the entropy is faster than the universal increase of a critical field,
whereas outside the core the entropy decreases and saturates the constant value
of the corresponding massive noncritical field. In addition, two solitons
manifest long-range entanglement that decreases with the separation of the
solitons more slowly than the universal decrease of the critical field.
Interestingly, in the noncritical regime of the Frenkel-Kontorova model,
entanglement can even increase with the separation of the solitons. We show
that most of the entanglement of the so-called internal modes of the solitons
is saturated by local degrees of freedom inside the core, and therefore we
suggest using the internal modes as carriers of quantum information.

These can be regarded as density fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. We
assume a linear dispersion relation with a fixed speed of sound and calculate
the density correlation function. We note that this function has the same form
as the correlation function for the time derivative of a relativistic massless
scalar field, but with the speed of light replaced by the speed of sound. As a
result, the study of density fluctuations in a fluid can be a useful analog
model for better understanding fluctuations in relativistic quantum field
theory. We next calculate the differential cross section for light scattering
by the zero point density fluctuations, and find a result proportional to the
fifth power of the light frequency. This can be understood as the product of
fourth power dependence of the usual Rayleigh cross section with the linear
frequency dependence of the spectrum of zero point density fluctuations. We
give some estimates of the relative magnitude of this effect compared to the
scattering by thermal density fluctuations, and find that it can be of order
0.5% for water at room temperature and optical frequencies. This relative
magnitude is proportional to frequency and inversely proportional to
temperature. Although the scattering by zero point density fluctuation is
small, it may be observable.

large class of inextendible antichains in the associated powerset lattice

Heisenberg Uncertainty is found to be closely related to the extent to which
the device beats the free-mass Standard Quantum Limit for force measurement. We

generalizes to many qubits the discovery by Gea-Banacloche for the one qubit

the entanglement between the qubits revives. Finally, it is argued that the

a transverse magnetic field (h). The attention is concentrated on an interval
of magnetic field between the factorizing field (h_f) and the critical one
(h_c). The model presents a spin-flop phase for 0&lt;h&lt;h_f with an energy scale
which is defined by the long range antiferromagnetic order while it undergoes
an entanglement phase transition at h=h_f. The entanglement estimators clearly
show that the entanglement is lost exactly at h=h_f which justifies different
quantum correlations on both sides of the factorizing field. As a consequence
of zero entanglement (at h=h_f) the ground state is known exactly as a product
of single particle states which is the starting point for initiating a spin
wave theory. The linear spin wave theory is implemented to obtain the specific
heat and thermal entanglement of the model in the interested region. A double
peak structure is found in the specific heat around h=h_f which manifests the
existence of two energy scales in the system as a result of two competing
orders before the critical point. These results are confirmed by the low

presence of both W-type entanglement and threetangle. In this case, constant
I_5 admits for a wide range of both threetangle and concurrences. Furthermore,
the present analysis indicates that an SL^3 orbit of states with equal tangles
but continuously varying I_5 must exist. This means that I_5 provides no
information on the entanglement in the system in addition to that contained in
the tangles (concurrences and threetangle) themselves. Together with the
numerical evidence that I_5 is an entanglement monotone this implies that SU(2)
invariance or the monotone property are too weak requirements for the
characterization and quantification of entanglement for systems of three

extended to general multipartite systems (including higher local dimension)

system and an environment is investigated. We derive a simple expression for
purity decrease at the first instants of evolution (when purity is close to
unity). We find that purity at very small times is maximal when an initial
state of an open system coincides with one of the eigenstates of the
interaction operator, no matter how weak the interaction is. On the other hand
it is widely known that in general eigenstates of the interaction are not
pointer states. Therefore the procedure of selecting pointer states by purity
maximization (known as &quot;purity sieve&quot;) should not rely on short-time purity
behavior. We propose a modification of the purity sieve criterion which
approximately takes into account purity evolution at longer times. As an
example of its applicability we recover known results for pointer states of a
particle undergoing quantum Brownian motion; we point out that the criterion is
not applicable for some other models, however. It is argued that the proposed
modified purity sieve may be used for selecting pointer states of a particle
undergoing decoherence through collisions.

However, while discussing the security, sometime we need to know exact
dimension, since current exponential de Finetti theorem, crucial to the
information-theoretical security proof, is deeply related with the dimension
and can only be applied to finite dimensional case. Here we address this
problem in detail. We show that if POVM elements corresponding to Alice and
Bob's measured results can be well described in a finite dimensional subspace
with sufficiently small error, then dimensions of Alice and Bob's states can be
almost regarded as finite. Since the security is well defined by the smooth
entropy, which is continuous with the density matrix, the small error of state
actually means small change of security. Then the security of
unknown-dimensional system can be solved. Finally we prove that for heterodyne

two-dimensional lattice of locally interacting ions. We propose here a layered
planar rf trap design that can be used to create arbitrary two-dimensional

As a first experimental demonstration, we confine strontium-88 ions in a
mm-scale lattice trap and verify numerical models of the trap by measuring the
motional frequencies. We also confine 440 nm diameter charged microspheres and
observe ion-ion repulsion between ions in neighboring lattice sites. Our
design, when scaled to smaller ion-ion distances, is appropriate for quantum
simulation schemes, e.g. that of Porras and Cirac (PRL 92 207901 (2004)). We
note, however, that in practical realizations of the trap, an increase in the
secular frequency with decreasing ion spacing may make a coupling rate that is
large relative to the decoherence rate in such a trap difficult to achieve.

equilibrium critical exponents. However, the latter are in general
non-trivially path-dependent, and detailed knowledge about the time-dependent

der Waals and hydrogen bonds. At ultralow temperatures a novel binding type
emerges paving the way for novel molecules and ultracold chemistry [1,2]. The
underlying mechanism for this new type of chemical bond is low-energy electron
scattering of Rydberg electrons from polarisable ground state atoms [3]. This
quantum scattering process can generate an attractive potential that is able to
bind the ground state atom to the Rydberg atom at a well localized position
within the Rydberg electron wave function. The resulting giant molecules can
have an internuclear separation of several thousand Bohr radii, which places
them among the largest known molecules to date. Their binding energies are much
smaller than the Kepler frequencies of the Rydberg electrons i.e. the atomic
Rydberg electron state is essentially unchanged by the bound ground state atom.
Ultracold and dense samples of atoms enable the creation of these molecules via
Rydberg excitation. In this paper we present spectroscopic evidence for the
vibrational ground and first excited state of a Rubidium dimer Rb(5S)-Rb(nS).
We apply a Born-Oppenheimer model to explain the measured binding energies for
principal quantum numbers n between 34 and 40 and extract the s-wave scattering
length for electron-Rb(5S) scattering in the relevant low energy regime Ekin &lt;
100 meV. We also determine the lifetimes and the polarisabilities of these
molecules. P-wave bound states [2], Trimer states [4] as well as bound states
for large angular momentum of the Rydberg electron - socalled trilobite
molecules [1] - are within reach in the near future and will further refine our
conceptual understanding of the chemical bond.

fact that security of a discrete-variable quantum key distribution protocol
against collective attacks implies security of the protocol against the most

surface-enhanced Raman scattering is presented. Interaction effects between a
general molecular system and a spatially anisotropic metal particle supporting
plasmon excitations in the presence of an external radiation field are
systematically included through many-body perturbation theory. Reduction of the
exact effects of molecular-electronic correlation to the level of Hartree-Fock
mean-field theory is made for practical initial implementation, while
description of collective oscillations of conduction electrons in the metal is
reduced to that of a classical plasma density; extension of the former to a
Kohn-Sham density-functional or second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation
theory is discussed; further specialization of the latter to the random-phase
approximation allows for several salient features of the formalism to be
highlighted without need for numerical computation. Scattering and
linear-response properties of the coupled system subjected to an external
perturbing electric field in the electric-dipole interaction approximation are
investigated. Both damping and finite-lifetime effects of molecular-electronic
excitations as well as the characteristic fourth-power enhancement of the
molecular Raman scattering intensity are elucidated from first principles. It
is demonstrated that the presented theory reduces to previous models of
surface-enhanced Raman scattering and leads naturally to a semiclassical
picture of the response of a quantum-mechanical molecular system interacting
with a spatially anisotropic classical metal particle with electronic
polarization approximated by a discretized collection of electric dipoles.

the entanglement dynamics, and usually leads to the loss of entanglement within
a finite time. Since entanglement is a key feature in the application of such
systems to quantum information processing, it is highly desirable to find a way
to prolonging its lifetime. We present a simple model of an interacting
two-qubit system in the presence of a thermal Markovian environment. The qubits
are modeled as interacting spin-$\half$ particles in a magnetic field and the
environment is limited to inducing single spin-flip events. A simple scheme
allows us to calculate the relaxation rates for all processes. We show that the
relaxation dynamics of the most entangled state exhibit critical slowing down
as a function of the magnetic field, where the relaxation rate changes from
exponentially small values to finite values in the zero-temperature limit. We
study the effect of temperature and magnetic field on all the other relaxation
rates and find that they exhibit unusual properties, such as non-monotonic
dependence on temperature and a discontinuity as a function of magnetic field.
In addition, a simple scheme to include non-Markovian effects is presented and
applied to the two-qubit model. We find that the relaxation rates exhibit a
sharp, cusp-like resonant structure as a function of the environment
memory-time, and that for long memory-times all the different relaxation rates
merge into a single one.

context. Magnetic Weyl calculus is adapted to incorporate both parameters, at
least one of which needs to be small. Of particular interest is the expansion
of the Weyl product which can be used to expand the product of operators in a
small parameter, a technique which is prominent to obtain perturbation
expansions. Three asymptotic expansions for the magnetic Weyl product of two
H\&quot;ormander class symbols are proven: (i) \eps \ll 1 and \lambda \ll 1, (ii)
\eps \ll 1 and \lambda = 1 as well as (iii) \eps = 1 and \lambda \ll 1.
Expansions (i) and (iii) are impossible to obtain with ordinary Weyl calculus.
Furthermore, I relate results derived by ordinary Weyl calculus with those

further entanglement sudden death/birth events culminating in the formation of

together with statistics of the entanglement genesis time in the weak

of `chemistry-only' approaches to the origins of life. It is suggested that the
magnetic 'face' of the minerals from the inorganic world, recognized to have
played a pivotal role in initiating Life, may throw light on some of these
issues. A magnetic environment in the form of rocks in the Hadean Ocean could
have enabled the accretion and therefore an ordered confinement of
super-paramagnetic colloids within a structured phase. A moderate H-field can
help magnetic nano-particles to not only overcome thermal fluctuations but also
harness them. Such controlled dynamics brings in the possibility of accessing
quantum effects, which together with frustrations in magnetic ordering and
hysteresis (a natural mechanism for a primitive memory) could throw light on
the birth of biological information which, as Abel argues, requires a
combination of order and complexity. This scenario gains strength from
observations of scale-free framboidal forms of the greigite mineral, with a
magnetic basis of assembly. And greigite's metabolic potential plays a key role

The fidelity is near one when parameters are in the same phase or same phase

not for the metal-insulator phase transition. For both phase transitions
$\nu/\alpha\approx2$. The von Neumann entropy is near one for the metallic

entire unitary group, much like a spherical design approximates the entire unit
sphere. In this paper, we use irreducible representations of the unitary group
to find a general lower bound on the size of a unitary t-design in U(d), for
any d and t. We also introduce the notion of a unitary code - a subset of U(d)
in which the trace inner product of any pair of matrices is restricted to only
a small number of distinct values - and give an upper bound for the size of a
code of degree s in U(d) for any d and s. These bounds can be strengthened when
the particular inner product values that occur in the code or design are known.
Finally, we describe some constructions of designs: we give an upper bound on
the size of the smallest weighted unitary t-design in U(d), and we catalogue
some t-designs that arise from finite groups.

As the magnetic field is varied, the ground states mix through a non-Abelian

The two gain lines are obtained by two-wave mixing between a probe field and

monitoring the change in the orbital frequency of neutron stars in a binary
system as they lose energy via gravitational radiation. However, GWs have not
yet been observed directly. The initial LIGO apparatus has not yet observed
GWs. The Advanced LIGO (AdLIGO) will use a combination of improved techniques
in order to increase the sensitivity. Along with power recycling and a higher
power laser source, the AdLIGO will employ signal recycling (SR). While SR
would increase sensitivity, it would also reduce the bandwidth significantly.
Previously, we and others have investigated, theoretically and experimentally,
the feasibility of using a White Light Cavity (WLC) to circumvent this
constraint. However, in the previous work, it was not clear how one would
incorporate the white light cavity effect. Here, we first develop a general

replace the signal recycling mirror. This design is simple, robust, completely
non-invasive, and can be added to the AdLIGO system without changing any other
optical elements. We show a choice of parameters for which the signal
sensitivity as well as the bandwidth are enhanced significantly over what is
planned for the AdLIGO, covering the entire spectrum of interest for

single as well as on many modes - can be reproduced by manipulating the
frequencies. Then, we proceed to describe schemes apt to generate unprecedented
degrees of bipartite and multipartite continuous variable entanglement under
realistic noisy working conditions, and even restricting only to a global
control of the trapping frequencies. Furthermore, we consider the transmission
of the quantum information encoded in the radial modes along the array of ions,
and show it to be possible to a remarkable degree of accuracy, for both
finite-dimensional and continuous variable quantum states. Finally, as an
application, we show that the states which can be generated in this setting
allow for the violation of multipartite non-locality tests, by feasible
displaced parity measurements. Such a demonstration would be a first test of
quantum non-locality for &quot;massive&quot; degrees of freedom (i.e., for degrees of
freedom describing the motion of massive particles).

  Circuits</title><description>  We investigate the theoretical limits of the effect of the quantum
interaction distance on the speed of exact quantum addition circuits. For this
study, we exploit graph embedding for quantum circuit analysis. We study a
logical mapping of qubits and gates of any $\Omega(\log n)$-depth quantum adder
circuit for two $n$-qubit registers onto a practical architecture, which limits
interaction distance to the nearest neighbors only and supports only one- and
two-qubit logical gates. Unfortunately, on the chosen $k$-dimensional practical
architecture, we prove that the depth lower bound of any exact quantum addition
circuits is no longer $\Omega(\log {n})$, but $\Omega(\sqrt[k]{n})$. This
result, the first application of graph embedding to quantum circuits and
devices, provides a new tool for compiler development, emphasizes the impact of
quantum computer architecture on performance, and acts as a cautionary note
when evaluating the time performance of quantum algorithms.

  particle</title><description>  We study the effects of the electromagnetic subvacuum fluctuations on the
dynamics of a nonrelativistic charged particle in a wavepacket. The influence
from the quantum field is expected to give an additional effect to the velocity
uncertainty of the particle. In the case of a static wavepacket, the observed
velocity dispersion is smaller in the electromagnetic squeezed vacuum
background than in the normal vacuum background. This leads to the subvacuum
effect. The extent of reduction in velocity dispersion associated with this
subvacuum effect is further studied by introducing a switching function. It is
shown that the slow switching process may make this subvacuum effect
insignificant. We also point out that when the center of the wavepacket
undergoes non-inertial motion, reduction in the velocity dispersion becomes
less effective with its evolution, no matter how we manipulate the
nonstationary quantum noise via the choice of the squeeze parameters. The role
of the underlying fluctuation-dissipation relation is discussed.

so called \emph{topological color codes} defined on a two-dimensional lattice
or \emph{2-colex}, are calculated. The topological entropy is used to measure
the entanglement of different bipartitions of the 2-colex. The dependency of
the ground state degeneracy on the genus of the surface shows that the color
code can support a topological order, and the contribution of the color in its
structure makes it interesting to compare with the Kitaev's toric code. While a
qubit is maximally entangled with rest of the system, two qubits are no longer
entangled showing that the color code is genuinely multipartite entangled. For
a convex region, it is found that entanglement entropy depends only on the
degrees of freedom living on the boundary of two subsystems. The boundary
scaling of entropy is supplemented with a topological subleading term which for
a color code defined on a compact surface is twice than the toric code. From
the entanglement entropy we construct a set of bipartitions in which the
diverging term arising from the boundary term is washed out, and the remaining
non-vanishing term will have a topological nature. Besides the color code on
the compact surface, we also analyze the entanglement properties of a version
of color code with border, i.e \emph{triangular color code}.

atomic center-of-mass plays the role of &quot;quantum apparatus&quot; for the atomic
spin. Following a recent, decoherence-based, model fitting with this
interpretation, we investigate whether or not such model can be constructed.
Our conclusions are somewhat surprising: only if the screen capturing the atoms
in the experiment brings the information about the atomic-nucleus
center-of-mass, one may construct the model desired. The nucleus $CM$ system is
monitored by the nucleus &quot;relative system ($R$)&quot;. There appear the effective
(the electrons-mediated) interaction between $CM$ and $R$ that is possibly
responsible for decoherence. For larger atoms, the interaction scales as $Z^2$
($Z$ is the &quot;atomic number&quot;), being totally independent on the atomic mass. The
interaction selects the $CM$-wave-packet states as the approximate pointer
basis. Interestingly enough, the model stems nonoccurrence of decoherence due
to the internal environment for the larger systems (such as the macromolecules
and the macroscopic systems). Certainly, disproving this model (e.g. in an

the reason that one would expect that a quantum mechanical scheme could
accomplish the search in O(square root of N) steps? It would be insightful to
have a simple two line argument for this without having to describe the details
of the search algorithm&quot;. The answer provided in this work is: &quot;because any
quantum algorithm takes the time taken by a classical algorithm that knows in
advance 50% of the information that specifies the solution of the problem&quot;.
This empirical fact, unnoticed so far, holds for both quadratic and exponential
speed ups and is theoretically justified in three steps: (i) once the physical
representation is extended to the production of the problem on the part of the
oracle and to the final measurement of the computer register, quantum
computation is reduction on the solution of the problem under a relation
representing problem-solution interdependence, (ii) the speed up is explained
by a simple consideration of time symmetry, it is the gain of information about
the solution due to backdating, to before running the algorithm, a
time-symmetric part of the reduction on the solution; this advanced knowledge
of the solution reduces the size of the solution space to be explored by the
algorithm, (iii) if I is the information acquired by measuring the content of
the computer register at the end of the algorithm, the quantum algorithm takes
the time taken by a classical algorithm that knows in advance 50% of I, which
brings us to the initial statement.

the 56 charge N=8 black holes and the tripartite entanglement of seven qubits
where the measure is provided by Cartan's E_7 supset [SL(2)]^7 invariant. The
qubits are naturally described by the seven vertices ABCDEFG of the Fano plane,
which provides the multiplication table of the seven imaginary octonions,
reflecting the fact that E_7 has a natural structure of an O-graded algebra.
This in turn provides a novel imaginary octonionic interpretation of the 56=7 x
8 charges of N=8: the 24=3 x 8 NS-NS charges correspond to the three imaginary
quaternions and the 32=4 x 8 R-R to the four complementary imaginary octonions.
N=8 black holes (or black strings) in five dimensions are also related to the
bipartite entanglement of three qutrits (3-state systems), where the analogous
measure is Cartan's E_6 supset [SL(3)]^3 invariant.

strongly affects the qubit dynamics, and leads to decoherence. In quantum
information processing with solid state qubits, decoherence significantly
limits the performances of such devices. Therefore, it is necessary to fully
understand the mechanisms that lead to decoherence. In this review we discuss
how decoherence affects two of the most successful realizations of solid state
qubits, namely, spin-qubits and superconducting qubits. In the former, the
qubit is encoded in the spin 1/2 of the electron, and it is implemented by
confining the electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot. Superconducting
devices show quantum behavior at low temperatures, and the qubit is encoded in
the two lowest energy levels of a superconducting circuit. The electron spin in
a quantum dot has two main decoherence channels, a (Markovian) phonon-assisted
relaxation channel, due to the presence of a spin-orbit interaction, and a
(non-Markovian) spin bath constituted by the spins of the nuclei in the quantum
dot that interact with the electron spin via the hyperfine interaction. In a
superconducting qubit, decoherence takes place as a result of fluctuations in
the control parameters, such as bias currents, applied flux, and bias voltages,
and via losses in the dissipative circuit elements.

scattering in a single-channel case. The method is based on the division of the
full function space into two segments, internal (localized) and external
(infinitely extended). The spectroscopic information on the resonances is
obtained from the non-Hermitian effective Hamilton operator $H_{\rm eff}$
appearing in the internal part due to the coupling to the external part. As
well known, additional so-called cut-off poles of the $S$-matrix appear,
generally, due to the truncation of the potential. We study the question of
spurious $S$ matrix poles in the framework of the Feshbach formalism. The
numerical analysis is performed for exactly solvable potentials with a finite
number of resonance states. These potentials represent a generalization of
Bargmann-type potentials to accept resonance states. Our calculations
demonstrate that the poles of the $S$ matrix obtained by using the Feshbach
projection-operator formalism coincide with both the complex energies of the
physical resonances and the cut-off poles of the $S$-matrix.

mechanics, the Born's Psi^{\star}\Psi probability density can be obtained from
the imaginary part of the velocity field of particles on the real axis.
Extending this probability axiom to the complex plane, we first attempt to find
a probability density by solving an appropriate conservation equation. The
characteristic curves of this conservation equation are found to be the same as
the complex paths of particles in the new representation. The boundary
condition in this case is that the extended probability density should agree
with the quantum probability rule along the real line. For the simple,
time-independent, one-dimensional problems worked out here, we find that a
conserved probability density can be derived from the velocity field of
particles, except in regions where the trajectories were previously suspected
to be nonviable. An alternative method to find this probability density in
terms of a trajectory integral, which is easier to implement on a computer and
useful for single particle solutions, is also presented. Most importantly, we
show, by using the complex extension of Schrodinger equation, that the desired
conservation equation can be derived from this definition of probability
density.

two-spin molecule that is coupled to a hot and noisy environment, in which no
static entanglement can survive. The system represents a non-equilibrium
quantum system which, driven through the oscillatory motion, is prevented from
reaching its (separable) thermal equilibrium state. Environmental noise,
together with the driven motion, plays a constructive role by periodically
resetting the system, even though it will destroy entanglement as usual. As a
building block, the present simple mechanism supports the perspective that
entanglement can exist also in systems which are exposed to a hot environment
and to high levels of de-coherence, which we expect e.g. for biological
systems. Our results furthermore suggest that entanglement plays a role in the
heat exchange between molecular machines and environment. Experimental
simulation of our model with trapped ions is within reach of the current

quantum information science: the development of a theory of entanglement and
the exploration of the use of controlled quantum systems to the simulation of
quantum many-body phenomena.
  In the first part we introduce a new approach to the study of entanglement by
considering its manipulation under operations not capable of generating
entanglement and show there is a total order for multipartite quantum states in
this framework. We also present new results on hypothesis testing of correlated
sources and give further evidence on the existence of NPPT bound entanglement.
  In the second part, we study the potential as well as the limitations of a
quantum computer for calculating properties of many-body systems. First we
analyse the usefulness of quantum computation to calculate additive
approximations to partition functions and spectral densities of local
Hamiltonians. We then show that the determination of ground state energies of
local Hamiltonians with an inverse polynomial spectral gap is QCMA-hard.
  In the third and last part, we approach the problem of quantum simulating
many-body systems from a more pragmatic point of view. We analyze the
realization of paradigmatic condensed matter Hamiltonians in arrays of coupled
microcavities, such as the Bose-Hubbard and the anisotropic Heisenberg models,
and discuss the feasibility of an experimental realization with
state-of-the-art current technology.

singularities are ubiquitous features of general relativity, Einstein's theory
of gravity. The utility of classical general relativity in describing
gravitational phenomena is maintained by the cosmic censorship principle. This
conjecture, whose validity is still one of the most important open questions in
general relativity, asserts that the undesirable spacetime singularities are
always hidden inside of black holes. In this Letter we reanalyze extreme
situations which have been considered as counterexamples to the cosmic
censorship hypothesis. In particular, we consider the absorption of fermion
particles by a spinning black hole. Ignoring quantum effects may lead one to
conclude that an incident fermion wave may over spin the black hole, thereby
exposing its inner singularity to distant observers. However, we show that when
quantum effects are properly taken into account, the integrity of the
black-hole event horizon is irrefutable. This observation suggests that the
cosmic censorship principle is intrinsically a quantum phenomena.

positrons by molecular hydrogen. Our results are sensitive to small changes in
the accuracy of the wave function representing the target hydrogen molecule. We

the results of variational calculations are not reliable, even when the target

modifies the available phase space for the recoiling atom and thereby modifies
its decay rate and the probability of the emitted photon's direction. We show

are pairs of such channels that, when used together, can transmit far more

Because quantum transmissions are necessarily private, this would imply a large

channels which display either (1) A large joint quantum capacity but very small

Defined by
analogy to classical random walk, a quantum walk is a time-homogeneous quantum
process on a graph. Both random and quantum walks can be defined either in
continuous or discrete time. But whereas a continuous-time random walk can be
obtained as the limit of a sequence of discrete-time random walks, the two
types of quantum walk appear fundamentally different, owing to the need for
extra degrees of freedom in the discrete-time case.
  In this article, I describe a precise correspondence between continuous- and
discrete-time quantum walks on arbitrary graphs. Using this correspondence, I
show that continuous-time quantum walk can be obtained as an appropriate limit
of discrete-time quantum walks. The correspondence also leads to a new
technique for simulating Hamiltonian dynamics, giving efficient simulations
even in cases where the Hamiltonian is not sparse. The complexity of the
simulation is linear in the total evolution time, an improvement over
simulations based on high-order approximations of the Lie product formula. As
applications, I describe a continuous-time quantum walk algorithm for element
distinctness and show how to optimally simulate continuous-time query
algorithms of a certain form in the conventional quantum query model. Finally,
I discuss limitations of the method for simulating Hamiltonians with negative
matrix elements, and present two problems that motivate attempting to
circumvent these limitations.

cannot increase the efficiency when the qubit error-probability is below a
certain value and the code size fixed. More surprisingly, existing
multiple-error correction codes with a code length equal or less than 256

any value of the qubit error-probability. We also investigate how efficient
various proposed nondegenerate single-error correcting codes are compared to

entanglement-assisted cheating in multi-prover interactive proof systems. It is
well-known that the standard oracularization technique completely fails in some
proof systems under the existence of prior entanglement. This paper studies two
constructions of two-prover one-round interactive proof systems based on
oracularization. First, it is proved that the two-prover one-round interactive
proof system for PSPACE by Cai, Condon, and Lipton still achieves exponentially
small soundness error in the existence of prior entanglement between dishonest
provers (and more strongly, even if dishonest provers are allowed to use
arbitrary no-signaling strategies). It follows that, unless the polynomial-time
hierarchy collapses to the second level, two-prover systems are still
advantageous to single-prover systems even when only malicious provers can use
quantum information. Second, it is proved that the two-prover one-round
interactive proof system obtained by oracularizing a three-query
probabilistically checkable proof system becomes sound in a weak sense even
against dishonest entangled provers with the help of a dummy question. As a
consequence, every language in NEXP has a two-prover one-round interactive
proof system of perfect completeness, albeit with exponentially small gap
between completeness and soundness, in which each prover responds with only two
bits. In other words, it is NP-hard to approximate within an inverse-polynomial
the value of a classical two-prover one-round game, even when provers are
entangled and each sends a two-bit answer to a verifier.

light field in a suitably prepared solid state atomic medium. The state of the
light is mapped onto collective atomic excitations on an optical transition and
stored for a pre-programmed time up of to 1 mu s before being released in a
well defined spatio-temporal mode as a result of a collective interference. The
coherence of the process is verified by performing an interference experiment
with two stored weak pulses with a variable phase relation. Visibilities of
more than 95% are obtained, which demonstrates the high coherence of the
mapping process at the single photon level. In addition, we show experimentally
that our interface allows one to store and retrieve light fields in multiple
temporal modes. Our results represent the first observation of collective
enhancement at the single photon level in a solid and open the way to multimode
solid state quantum memories as a promising alternative to atomic gases.

level atoms. The atoms enter and exit the cavity at different times. Instead of
using constant coupling, we use time dependent couplings which represent the
spatial dependence of the mode. Although the system evolution is adiabatic for
most of the time, a previously unstudied energy crossing plays a key role in
the system dynamics when the atoms have a time delay. We show that conditional
atom-cavity entanglement can be generated, while for large photon numbers the
entangled system has a behaviour which can be mapped onto the single atom
Jaynes-Cummings model. Exploring the main features of this system we propose
simple and fairly robust methods for entangling atoms independently of the

with atomic qubits.

For each gate in the universal set, sweep parameter values are provided which

  supersymmetric systems in 1+1 dimensions</title><description>  We consider the general supersymmetric one-dimensional quantum system with
boundary, critical in the bulk but not at the boundary. The renormalization
group flow on the space of boundary conditions is generated by the boundary
beta functions \beta^{a}(\lambda) for the boundary coupling constants
\lambda^{a}. We prove a gradient formula \partial\ln z/\partial\lambda^{a}
=-g_{ab}^{S}\beta^{b} where z(\lambda) is the boundary partition function at
given temperature T=1/\beta, and g_{ab}^{S}(\lambda) is a certain
positive-definite metric on the space of supersymmetric boundary conditions.
The proof depends on canonical ultraviolet behavior at the boundary. Any system
whose short distance behavior is governed by a fixed point satisfies this
requirement. The gradient formula implies that the boundary energy,
-\partial\ln z/\partial\beta = -T\beta^{a}\partial_{a}\ln z, is nonnegative.
Equivalently, the quantity \ln z(\lambda) decreases under the renormalization
group flow.

simple iterative rules. The coherent exciton dynamics is modeled by
continuous-time quantum walks and we calculate the transition probabilities
between two nodes of the networks. We find that the transport depends on the
initial nodes of the excitation. For networks less than the second generation
the coherent transport shows perfect revivals when the initial excitation
starts at the central node. For networks of higher generation, the transport
only shows partial revivals. Moreover, we find that the excitation is most
likely to be found at the initial nodes while the coherent transport to other
nodes has a very low probability. In the long time limit, the transition
probabilities show characteristic patterns with identical values of limiting
probabilities. Finally, the dynamics of quantum transport are compared with the

be axiomatised in terms of composition of operations and tensor product only,
without any explicit reference to the underlying vector spaces. This

of our new theory in elucidating the underlying physics of the double-slit

scatters from one of the slits at a given time. After the scattering through
one of the slits, the particle shares some of its energy with its surrounding
field and a particle-field system is again formed which its motion is governed
by a deterministic dynamics during its flight towards the detecting screen. The
interference pattern is then explained by showing how the final location of
each particle-field system at the time of reaching the detecting screen is
distributed according to an angular distribution (equal to the what quantum
theory predicts for the fringe effects in a two-slit experiment). The
probabilistic nature of such a distribution can be explained by considering the
variations of the kinetic energy of the particle-field system at different
local situations.

properties of the density of states: I) collapsed resonances that split at an
exceptional point in II) two resolved resonances ; III) out-of-band resonances;
IV) virtual states; and V) pure point spectrum. We associate them with
distinctive dynamical regimes: overdamped, damped oscillations, environment
controlled quantum diffusion, anomalous diffusion and localized dynamics
respectively. The frequency of the swap gate depends differently on the
unperturbed Rabi frequency. In region I) there is no oscillation at all, while
in the regions III) and IV) the oscillation frequency is particularly stable
because it is determined by environment's band width. The anomalous diffusion

  Fields And Beyond</title><description>  In a series of essays, beginning with this article, we are going to develop a
new formulation of micro-phenomena based on the principles of reality and
causality. The new theory provides with us a new depiction of micro-phenomena
assuming an unified concept of information, matter and energy. So, we suppose
that in a definite micro-physical context (including other interacting
particles), each particle is enfolded by a probability field whose existence is
contingent upon the existence of the particle, but it can locally affect the
physical status of the particle in a context-dependent manner. The dynamics of
the whole particle-field system obeys deterministic equations in a manner that
when the particle is subjected to a conservative force, the field also
experiences a conservative complex force which its form is determined by the
dynamics of particle. So, the field is endowed with a given amount of energy,
but its value is contingent upon the physical conditions the particle is
subjected to. Based on the energy balance of the particle and its associated
field, we argue why the field has a probabilistic objective nature. In such a
way, the basic elements of this new formulation, its application for some
stationary states and its nonlinear generalization for conservative systems are
discussed here.

probabilistic observables. For two-level probabilistic observables only a
probability for finding the values one or minus one can be given for any
micro-state, while such observables can be realized as classical observables
with sharp values on a substate level. For a continuous family of micro-states
parameterized by a sphere all the quantum mechanical laws for a two-state
system follow under the assumption that the purity of the ensemble is conserved
by the time evolution. The non-commutative correlation functions of quantum
mechanics correspond to the use of conditional correlation functions in
classical statistics. We further discuss the classical statistical realization

We conclude that quantum mechanics can be derived from a classical statistical

introducing mathematicians, physicists, and engineers to the ideas relating
classical and quantum mechanics with Lie algebras and Lie groups. The book
emphasizes the closeness of classical and quantum mechanics, and the material
is selected in a way to make this closeness as apparent as possible.
  Much of the material covered here is not part of standard textbook treatments
of classical or quantum mechanics (or is only superficially treated there). For
physics students who want to get a broader view of the subject, this book may
therefore serve as a useful complement to standard treatments of quantum
mechanics.
  Almost without exception, this book is about precise concepts and exact
results in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics.
The structural properties of mechanics are discussed independent of
computational techniques for obtaining quantitatively correct numbers from the
assumptions made. The standard approximation machinery for calculating from
first principles explicit thermodynamic properties of materials, or explicit
cross sections for high energy experiments can be found in many textbooks and
is not repeated here.

world-line approach. A geometrical subtraction scheme gives the finite
interaction energy that determines the Casimir force. The spectral function of
convex domains is obtained from a probability measure on convex surfaces that
is induced by the Wiener measure on Brownian bridges the convex surfaces are
the hulls of. The vacuum force on the piston by a scalar field satisfying
Dirichlet boundary conditions is attractive in these geometries, but the
strength and short-distance behavior of the force depends crucially on the
shape of the piston casing. For a cylindrical casing with a hemispherical head,
the force for $a/R\sim 0$ does not depend on the dimension of the casing and
numerically approaches $\sim - 0.00326(4)\hbar c/a^2$. Semiclassically this
asymptotic force is due to short, closed and non-periodic trajectories that
reflect once off the piston near its periphery. The semiclassical estimate
$-\hbar c/(96\pi a^2)(1+2\sqrt{R^2-r^2}/a)$ for the force when $a/r\ll r/R\leq

orthogonal states of finite or infinite cardinality p exhibit an interesting
physical effect. The analysis of the amplitudes of the state at half the step
time with the elements of this set (the anticipation amplitudes) shows, that
for randomly chosen states measurements of the state at half-step time reveal
information about the states at full step time, anticipating future states and
reflecting past states with significant probability. For fixed N and p to
infinity, the probability to measure a state which is N steps apart in future
or past exceeds a constant lower bound. We characterize the spectrum, establish
an analog to Plack's relation, define a random sampling scheme, analyze the
resulting distribution of the anticipation probabilities and point out
applications.

comparison between quantum and classical walks can be attained based on the
average displacement of the walker as a function of time. Indeed, a fast growth
of the average displacement can be advantageously exploited to build up
efficient search algorithms. By means of analytical and numerical
investigations, we show that the finiteness and the inhomogeneity of the

interplay between the quantum-walk dynamics and the underlying topology by
studying the temporal evolution of the transfer probability distribution and
the lower bound of long time averages.

frequency-degenerate or non-degenerate. Based on this analysis, we derive
conditions on the pump frequencies and on the fiber dispersion parameters which
guarantee the generation of ultra-broadband photon pairs. Such photon pairs are
characterized by: i) a very large degree of entanglement, and ii) a very high

Through a numerical exercise, we find that the use of photonic crystal fiber

can be adjusted to particular needs through an appropriate choice of the PCF

  relaxation rates</title><description>  Superconducting electrical circuits can be used to study the physics of
cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) in new regimes, therefore realizing
circuit QED. For quantum information processing and quantum optics, an
interesting regime of circuit QED is the dispersive regime, where the detuning
between the qubit transition frequency and the resonator frequency is much
larger than the interaction strength. In this paper, we investigate how
non-linear corrections to the dispersive regime affect the measurement process.
We find that in the presence of pure qubit dephasing, photon population of the
resonator used for the measurement of the qubit act as an effective heat bath,
inducing incoherent relaxation and excitation of the qubit. Measurement thus
induces both dephasing and mixing of the qubit, something that can reduce the
quantum non-demolition aspect of the readout. Using quantum trajectory theory,
we show that this heat bath can induce quantum jumps in the qubit state and
reduce the achievable signal-to-noise ratio of a homodyne measurement of the
voltage.

states that there must exist non-orthogonal states, that is states that,
although different, have a non-zero overlap. This finite overlap means that
there is no way of determining with certainty in which of two such states a

  based on stabilizer codes</title><description>  We study properties of stabilizer codes that permit a local description on a
regular D-dimensional lattice. Specifically, we assume that the stabilizer
group of a code (the gauge group for subsystem codes) can be generated by local
Pauli operators such that the support of any generator is bounded by a
hypercube of constant size. Our first result concerns the optimal scaling of
the distance $d$ with the linear size of the lattice $L$. We prove an upper
bound $d=O(L^{D-1})$ which is tight for D=1,2. This bound applies to both
subspace and subsystem stabilizer codes. Secondly, we analyze the suitability
of stabilizer codes for building a self-correcting quantum memory. Any
stabilizer code with geometrically local generators can be naturally
transformed to a local Hamiltonian penalizing states that violate the
stabilizer condition. A degenerate ground-state of this Hamiltonian corresponds
to the logical subspace of the code. We prove that for D=1,2 the height of the
energy barrier separating different logical states is upper bounded by a
constant independent of the lattice size L. The same result holds if there are
unused logical qubits that are treated as &quot;gauge qubits&quot;. It demonstrates that
a self-correcting quantum memory cannot be built using stabilizer codes in
dimensions D=1,2. This result is in sharp contrast with the existence of a
classical self-correcting memory in the form of a two-dimensional ferromagnet.
Our results leave open the possibility for a self-correcting quantum memory
based on 2D subsystem codes or on 3D subspace or subsystem codes.

The superposed light fields at each output port of the beam splitter are sent
to two distant observers, where the fields are interfered and manipulated at
each observer by using a quarter wave plate and an analyzer. The interference
signal contains information of the projection angle of the analyzer, which is

oscillator, for example as part of string theory, is insufficient to describe
all the states of the relativistic oscillator. We find that there are three
different vacua leading to three disconnected Fock sectors, all constructed
with the same creation-annihilation operators. These have different spacetime
geometric properties as well as different algebraic symmetry properties or
different quantum numbers. Two of these Fock spaces include negative norm
ghosts (as in string theory) while the third one is completely free of ghosts.
We discuss a gauge symmetry in a worldline theory approach that supplies
appropriate constraints to remove all the ghosts from all Fock sectors of the
single oscillator. The resulting ghost free quantum spectrum in d+1 dimensions
is then classified in unitary representations of the Lorentz group SO(d,1).
Moreover all states of the single oscillator put together make up a single
infinite dimensional unitary representation of a hidden global symmetry
SU(d,1), whose Casimir eigenvalues are computed. Possible applications of these
new results in string theory and other areas of physics and mathematics are
briefly mentioned.

  measurements with an application to quantum data hiding</title><description>  Every sufficiently rich set of measurements on a fixed quantum system defines
a statistical norm on the states of that system via the optimal bias that can
be achieved in distinguishing the states using measurements from that set
(assuming equal priors). The Holevo-Helstrom theorem says that for the set of
all measurements this norm is the trace norm. For finite dimension any norm is
lower and upper bounded by constant (though dimension dependent) multiples of
the trace norm, so we set ourselves the task of computing or bounding the best
possible &quot;constants of domination&quot; for the norms corresponding to various
restricted sets of measurements, thereby determining the worst case and best
case performance of these sets relative to the set of all measurements.
  We look at the case where the allowed set consists of a single measurement,
namely the uniformly random continuous POVM and its approximations by 2-designs
and 4-designs respectively. Here we find asymptotically tight bounds for the
constants of domination.
  Furthermore, we analyse the multipartite setting with any LOCC measurement
allowed. In the case of two parties, we show that the lower domination constant
is the same as that of a tensor product of local uniformly random POVMs (up to
a constant). This answers in the affirmative an open question about the
(near-)optimality of bipartite data hiding: The bias that can be achieved by
LOCC in discriminating two orthogonal states of a d x d bipartite system is
Omega(1/d), which is known to be tight. Finally, we use our analysis to derive
certainty relations (in the sense of Sanchez-Ruiz) for any such measurements
and to lower bound the locally accessible information for bipartite systems.

novel resource, to quantum information science. The theory of entanglement
establishes basic laws, such as the non-increase of entanglement under local
operations, that govern its manipulation and aims to draw from them formal
analogies to the second law of thermodynamics. However, while in the second law
the entropy uniquely determines whether a state is adiabatically accessible
from another, the manipulation of entanglement under local operations exhibits
a fundamental irreversibility which prevents the existence of such an order.
  Here we show that a reversible theory of entanglement and a rigorous
relationship with thermodynamics may be established when one considers all
non-entangling transformations. The role of the entropy in the second law is
taken by the asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement in the basic law of
entanglement. We show the usefulness of this new approach to general resource

states of light based on an out-of-plane Sagnac interferometer. Both
Hermite-Gauss (HG) and Laguerre-Gauss (LG) modes can be guided into one of two
output ports according to the two-dimensional parity of the mode in question.
Our interferometer sorts HG_nm input modes depending upon whether they have
even or odd order n+m; it equivalently sorts LG modes depending upon whether
they have an even or odd value of their orbital angular momentum. It functions
efficiently at the single-photon level, and therefore can be used to sort
single-photon states. Due to the inherent phase stability of this type of
interferometer as compared to those of the Mach-Zehnder type, it provides a
promising tool for the manipulation and filtering of higher order transverse
spatial modes for the purposes of quantum information processing. For example,
several similar Sagnacs cascaded together may allow, for the first time, a
stable measurement of the orbital angular momentum of a true single-photon

can use the Sagnac in conjunction with a multi-mode fiber as a spatial mode
filter, which can be used to produce spatial-mode entangled Bell states and
heralded single photons in arbitrary first-order (n+m=1) spatial states,
covering the entire Poincare sphere of first-order transverse modes.

-- nonbinary stabilizer codes. It clarifies the connections of stabilizer codes
to classical codes over quadratic extension fields, provides many new
constructions of quantum codes, and develops further the theory of optimal
quantum codes and punctured quantum codes. Secondly, it contributes to the
theory of operator quantum error correcting codes also called as subsystem

stabilizer codes. This dissertation develops a framework for study and analysis
of subsystem codes using character theoretic methods. In particular, this work
establishes a close link between subsystem codes and classical codes showing
that the subsystem codes can be constructed from arbitrary classical codes.
Thirdly, it seeks to exploit the knowledge of noise to design efficient quantum

depolarizing channel. It gives systematic constructions of asymmetric quantum
stabilizer codes that exploit the asymmetry of errors in certain quantum
channels.

which are optimized for given noise channels. Our theory accounts for
uncertainties in the noise channel, against which our QEC procedures are
robust. We demonstrate via numerical examples that our optimized QEC procedures
always achieve a higher channel fidelity than the standard error correction
method, which is agnostic about the specifics of the channel. This demonstrates
the importance of channel characterization before QEC procedures are applied.
Our main novel finding is that in the setting of a known noise channel the
recovery ancillas are redundant for optimized quantum error correction. We show
this using a general rank minimization heuristic and supporting numerical
calculations. Therefore, one can further improve the fidelity by utilizing all
the available ancillas in the encoding block.

entanglement exhibits singular behavior. The singular behavior within finite
steps of RG obeys a scaling hypothesis and reveals the correlation length
exponent. However, under the infinite steps of RG transformation, the singular
behavior is rendered different and is universal only when there is an
underlying conformal-field-theory description of the critical point.

The spin factor (-1)^2s belongs to the exchange wave function when this

trapped atomic ions as probes is highly dependent on the measurement situation
at hand and thus calls for specialized traps. Previous approaches for ion traps
with enhanced optical access included traps consisting of a single ring
electrode or two opposing endcap electrodes. Other possibilities are planar
trap geometries, which have been investigated for Penning traps and rf-trap
arrays. By not having the electrodes lie in a common plane the optical access
in the latter cases can be substantially increased. Here, we discuss the
fabrication and experimental characterization of a novel radio-frequency (rf)
ion trap geometry. It has a relatively simple structure and provides largely
unrestricted optical and physical access to the ion, of up to 96% of the total
4pi solid angle in one of the three traps tested. We also discuss potential
applications in quantum optics and field sensing. As a force sensor, we

  Gate</title><description>  According to idealized models, a strong Kerr non-linearity may be used to
build optical quantum gates for optical quantum information processing by
inducing conditional phase shifts on quantum states. Recently, Shapiro (PRA 73,
062305 (2006)) argued that for a Kerr medium with non-instantaneous but fast
response, essentially no phase shift is induced on two-single-photon input
states, and thus a quantum gate build from such a medium cannot work. Here we
show that a fast response Kerr medium induces some but very little phase shifts
on a two-single-photon input state, and it is insufficient for high fidelity
quantum computation. We point out that this is caused by the medium imparting
spectral entanglement to the input photons. We further show that a way to
circumvent this problem and achieve a high fidelity gate, is to engineer the
dispersion properties of the medium to give a dominant spectral effect over the
non-instantaneous response, in addition to satisfying a phase matching
condition.

probes the question of what can be achieved with respect to the basis
$\{\ket{\0},\ket{\1}}^{\otimes n}$ of $n$ logical qubits, given only a few
copies of the unknown states $\ket{\0}$ and $\ket{\1}$. A phase-invariant
operator is one that is unchanged under the relative phase-shift $\ket{\1}

show that phase-invariant unitary operators can be implemented exactly with no
copies and that phase-invariant states can be prepared exactly with at most $n$
copies each of $\ket{\0}$ and $\ket{\1}$; we give an explicit algorithm for
state preparation that is efficient for some classes of states (e.g. symmetric
states). We conjecture that certain non-phase-invariant operations are
impossible to perform accurately without many copies. Motivated by optical
implementations of quantum computers, we define ``quantum computation in a
hidden basis'' to mean executing a quantum algorithm with respect to the
phase-shifted hidden basis $\{\ket{\0}, e^{i\theta}\ket{\1}\}$, for some
potentially unknown $\theta$; we give an efficient approximation algorithm for
this task, for which we introduce an analogue of a coherent state of light,
which serves as a bounded quantum phase reference frame encoding $\theta$. Our
motivation was quantum-public-key cryptography, however the techniques are
general. We apply our results to quantum-public-key authentication protocols,
by showing that a natural class of digital signature schemes for classical
messages is insecure. We also give a protocol for identification that uses many

slowing of light pulses is shown to be realistic, in the presence of the

there is no distortion in the case where the length of the pulse is much longer

upper bound on its success probability (the known (2,1,0.85) and (3,1,0.79)
QRACs match this upper bound). We discuss some particular constructions for
several small values of n.
  We also study the classical counterpart of this model where n bits are
encoded into 1 bit instead of 1 qubit and SR is used. We give an optimal
construction for such codes and find their success probability exactly--it is
less than in the quantum case.

scheme. We introduce adaptive teleportation, i.e., such that the choice of
entangled state used in the next teleportation depends on the results of the
measurements performed during the previous teleportations. We show that
adaptive teleportation enables an increase in the probability of faithful
multiple teleportation in the KLM scheme. In particular if a qubit is to be
teleported more than once then it is better to use nonmaximally entangled

on the nilpotent commuting variables. In this formalism qubits exhibit
properties of composite objects being subject of the Pauli exclusion principle,
but otherwise behaving boson-like. They are not fundamental particles. In such
an approach the classical limit yields the nilpotent mechanics.
  Using the space of $\eta$-wavefunctions, generalized Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation
etc. we study properties of pure qubit systems and also properties of some
composed, hybrid models: fermion-qubit, boson-qubit. The fermion-qubit system
can be truly supersymmetric, with both SUSY partners having identical spectra.
It is new and very interesting that SUSY transformations relate here only
nilpotent object. The $\eta$-eigenfunctions for the qubit-qubit system give the
set of Bloch vectors as a natural basis.
  Then the $\eta$-formalism is applied to the description of the pure state
entanglement. Nilpotent commuting variables were firstly used in this context
in [A. Mandilara, et. al., Phys. Rev. A \textbf{74}, 022331 (2006)], we
generalize and extend approach presented there. Our main tool for study the
entanglement or separability of states are Wronskians of $\eta$-functions. The
known invariants and entanglement monotones for systems of $n=2,3,4$ qubits are
expressed in terms of the Wronskians. This approach gives criteria for
separability of states and insight into the flavor of entanglement of the
system and simplifies description.

  atoms</title><description>  A detailed treatment of the entanglement dynamics of two distant but
non-identical systems is presented. We study the entanglement evolution of two
remote atoms interacting independently with a cavity field, as in the double
Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model. The four-qubit pairwise concurrences are studied,
allowing for asymmetric atom-cavity couplings and off-resonant ineractions.
Counter to intuition, imperfect matching can prove advantageous to entanglement
creation and evolution. For two types of initial entanglement, corresponding to
spin correlated and anti-correlated Bell states \Phi and \Psi, a full, periodic
and directed transfer of entanglement into a specific qubit pair is possible,
for resonant interactions, depending on the choice of relative couplings.
Furthermore, entanglement transfer and sudden death (ESD) can be prevented
using off-resonant interactions, although for some initial states, detunings
will trigger an otherwise frozen entanglement, to allow a full entanglement
transfer. We confirm a conservation rule governing the pairwise entanglement
between the non-interacting systems, that for the initial state \Psi the sum of
the square of these concurrences (SSC) is conserved. For \Phi, the total SSC is
reduced periodically, even to zero in some cases, to reveal a complete and
abrupt loss of all non-local pairwise entanglement.

First, we consider two similar oscillators with equal total energy. In
classical domain, we can easily solve this model and obtain the trajectories in
the space of variables. This picture in the quantum level is equivalent with a
hyperbolic partial differential equation which gives us a freedom for choosing
the initial wave function and its initial slope. By taking advantage of this
freedom, we propose a method to choose an appropriate initial condition which
is independent from the form of the oscillators. We then construct the wave
packets for some cases and show that these wave packets closely follow the
whole classical trajectories and peak on them. Moreover, we use de-Broglie Bohm
interpretation of quantum mechanics to quantify this correspondence and show
that the resulting Bohmian trajectories are also in a complete agreement with
their classical counterparts.

field and a Proca sector containing 4D gauge fields with masses $m_n=n/R$ where
$n$ is a positive integer. An important point is that, in the presence of
perfectly conducting parallel plates, the three degrees of freedom do not yield
three discrete (non-penetrating) modes but two discrete modes and one continuum
(penetrating) mode. The massless sector reproduces Casimir's original result
and the Proca sector yields the corrections. The contribution from the Proca
continuum mode is obtained within the framework of Lifshitz theory for plane
parallel dielectrics whereas the discrete modes are calculated via 5D formulas

preparation process and a measurement process leading to a registration of a
particular outcome. These two ingredients of the experiment are represented by
states and effects, respectively. Further, the whole picture of quantum
measurement will be developed and concepts of observables, instruments and
measurement models representing the three different descriptions on experiments
will be introduced. In the second stage, we enrich the model of the experiment
by introducing the concept of quantum channel describing the system changes
between preparations and measurements. At the very end we review the elementary
properties of quantum entanglement. The text contains many examples and
exercise covering also many topics from quantum information theory and quantum
measurement theory. The goal is to give a mathematically clear and

quantum systems is proposed. This scheme includes three steps: (1) amplitude
amplification of the initial state by a suitable unitary transformation, (2)
projective measurement on the amplified state, and (3) final optimization by a
unitary controlled transformation. The first step increases the amplitudes of
some desired eigenstates and the corresponding probability of observing these
eigenstates, the second step projects, with high probability, the amplified
state into a desired eigenstate, and the last step steers this eigenstate into
the target state. Within this scheme, two control algorithms are presented for
two classes of quantum systems. As an example, the incoherent control scheme is
applied to the control of a hydrogen atom by an external field. The results
support the suggestion that projective measurements can serve as an effective
control and local controllability information can be used to design control

recently, both theoretically and experimentally. In particular, they have
prompted suggestions that quantum mechanics involves acausal effects. Using a
recently developed approach which takes apparatus into account, we present a
detailed analysis of various double-slit experiments to show that this is never

probabilistic environments are new representations and computation mechanisms.
In this paper, a novel quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method is proposed
by combining quantum theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by the
state superposition principle and quantum parallelism, a framework of value
updating algorithm is introduced. The state (action) in traditional RL is
identified as the eigen state (eigen action) in QRL. The state (action) set can
be represented with a quantum superposition state and the eigen state (eigen
action) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state
according to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The probability of
the eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is
parallelly updated according to rewards. Some related characteristics of QRL
such as convergence, optimality and balancing between exploration and
exploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good
tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude
and can speed up learning through the quantum parallelism. To evaluate the
performance and practicability of QRL, several simulated experiments are given
and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of QRL algorithm
for some complex problems. The present work is also an effective exploration on
the application of quantum computation to artificial intelligence.

dissipative quantum mechanics of a damped harmonic oscillator in phase space.
Its key ingredient is a non-Hermitian deformation of the Moyal star product
with the damping constant as deformation parameter. We compare the
Dito-Turrubiates scheme with phase-space quantum mechanics (or deformation
quantization) based on other star products, and extend it to incorporate Wigner
functions. The deformed (or damped) star product is related to a complex
Hamiltonian, and so necessitates a modified equation of motion involving
complex conjugation. We find that with this change the Wigner function
satisfies the classical equation of motion. This seems appropriate since
non-dissipative systems with quadratic Hamiltonians share this property.

Heralded photons are those photons that, produced during a parametric
downconversion process, are &quot;labelled&quot; by the detection and counting of
coincidences of their correlated or entangled twins and therefore can be
discriminated from the background noise, independently of the type of
correlation/entanglement used in the setup. Without losing any generality, we
illustrate our proposal with a gedankenexperiment, in which the presence of a
gravitational wave causes a relative rotation of the reference frames
associated to the double-slit and the test polarizer, respectively, of a
Walborn's quantum eraser \cite{wal02}. In this thought experiment, the GW is
revealed by the detection of heralded photons in the dark fringes of the
recovered interference pattern by the quantum eraser. Other types of
entanglement, such as momentum-space or energy-time, could be used to obtain
heralded photons to be used in the future with high-frequency GW
interferometric detectors when enough bright sources of correlated photons will

taken alone, stationary states (energy eigenstates) are in no way singled out
with respect to nonstationary ones, and moreover the stationary states would be
difficult if possible to realize in practice. Owing to the nonstationary states
any quantum system can absorb or emit energy in arbitrary continuous amounts.
The peculiarity of the stationary states appears only if electromagnetic
radiation that must always accompany nonstationary processes in real systems is
taken into account. On the other hand, when the quantum system absorbs or emits
energy in the form of a wave the determining role is played by resonance
interaction of the system with the wave. Here again the stationary states
manifest themselves. These facts and influence of the resonator upon the
incident wave enable one to explain all effects ascribed to manifestation of
the corpuscular properties of light (the photoelectric effect, the Compton

quite convincing evidence that adherence to the Dyson-index pattern does also
hold for ESFs, at least as regards the upper half-range 1/2 &lt;= C &lt;= 1 of the
maximal concurrence over spectral orbits, C. To be specific, it strongly
appears that in this upper half-range, the real two-qubit ESF is simply
proportional to (2-2 C)^(3/2), and its complex counterpart--in conformity to
the Dyson-index pattern--proportional to the square of the real ESF, that is,
(2-2 C)^3. The previously documented piecewise continuous (&quot;semilinear&quot;)

used to derive upper bounds to fault tolerance thresholds - usually by
identifying a privileged resource, such as an entangling gate or a non-Clifford
operation, and then deriving the noise levels required to make it
`unprivileged'. In this work we consider extensions of this approach where
noise is added to Clifford gates too, and then `commuted' around until it
concentrates on attacking the non-Clifford resource. While commuting noise
around is not always straightforward, we find that easy instances can be
identified in popular fault tolerance proposals, thereby enabling sharper upper
bounds to be derived in these cases. For instance we find that if we take
Knill's high threshold proposal together with the ability to prepare any
possible state in the $XY$ plane of the Bloch sphere, then no more than 3.69%
error-per-gate noise is sufficient to make it classical, and 13.71% of Knill's

being added to the decoding parts of the circuits. Introducing such noise in a

identify a number of regimes associated with weak qubit-detector coupling. An
incoherent detector whose switching time is measurable with high accuracy can
provide high-fidelity information, but the measurement basis is determined only
upon switching of the detector. An incoherent detector whose switching time can
be known only with low accuracy provides a measurement in the qubit's energy
eigenbasis with reduced measurement fidelity. A coherent detector measures the
qubit in its energy eigenbasis and, under certain conditions, can provide
high-fidelity information.

a number of different one- and two-photon input states, including Fock, dual

Gurvits showed that this problem is NP-hard if rho is located within an inverse
exponential (with respect to dimension) distance from the border of the set of
separable quantum states. In this paper, we extend this NP-hardness to an
inverse polynomial distance from the separable set. The result follows from a

  resources</title><description>  It is often argued that entanglement is at the root of the speedup for
quantum compared to classical computation, and that one needs a sufficient
amount of entanglement for this speedup to be manifest. In measurement-based
quantum computing (MBQC), the need for a highly entangled initial state is
particularly obvious. Defying this intuition, we show that quantum states can
be too entangled to be useful for the purpose of computation. We prove that
this phenomenon occurs for a dramatic majority of all states: the fraction of
useful n-qubit pure states is less than exp(-n^2). Computational universality
is hence a rare property in quantum states. This work highlights a new aspect
of the question concerning the role entanglement plays for quantum
computational speed-ups. The statements remain true if one allows for certain
forms of post-selection and also cover the notion of CQ-universality. We
identify scale-invariant states resulting from a MERA construction as likely
candidates for physically relevant states subject to this effect.

instances have only one witness is powerful enough to solve the entire NP class
(under randomized reductions).
  We are interested in extending this result to the quantum setting. We prove
extensions to the classes Merlin-Arthur (MA) and
Quantum-Classical-Merlin-Arthur (QCMA). Our results have implications on the
complexity of approximating the ground state energy of a quantum local
Hamiltonian with a unique ground state and an inverse polynomial spectral gap.
We show that the estimation, to within polynomial accuracy, of the ground state
energy of poly-gapped 1-D local Hamiltonians is QCMA-hard, under randomized
reductions. This is in strong contrast to the case of constant gapped 1-D
Hamiltonians, which is in NP. Moreover, it shows that unless QCMA can be
reduced to NP by randomized reductions, there is no classical description of
the ground state of every poly-gapped local Hamiltonian which allows the
calculation of expectation values efficiently.
  Finally, we discuss a few obstacles towards establishing an analogous result
to the class Quantum-Merlin-Arthur (QMA). In particular, we show that random
projections fail to provide a polynomial gap between two witnesses.

teleportation on stabilizer codes, the most well-known quantum codes, Pauli
gates and Clifford operators can be applied fault-tolerantly. Indeed, this
technique can be generalized for an extended set of gates, the so called
${\mathcal{C}}_k$ hierarchy gates, introduced by Gottesman and Chuang (Nature,
402, 390-392). ${\mathcal{C}}_k$ gates are a generalization of Clifford
operators, but our knowledge of these sets is not as rich as our knowledge of
Clifford gates. Zeng et al. in (Phys. Rev. A 77, 042313) raise the question of
the relation between ${\mathcal{C}}_k$ hierarchy and the set of semi-Clifford

${\mathcal{C}}_k$ gate is a generalized semi-Clifford operator. In this paper,
we prove this conjecture for $k=3$. Using the techniques that we develop, we

system-reservoir interaction, with the system and reservoir assumed to be
initially separable. We compare and contrast the decoherence of the two-qubit
system in the case where the qubits are mutually close-by (`collective regime')
or distant (`localized regime') with respect to the spatial variation of the
environment. Sudden death of entanglement (as quantified by concurrence) is
shown to occur in the localized case rather than in the collective case, where
entanglement tends to `ring down'. A consequence of the QND character of the
interaction is that the time-evolved fidelity of a Bell state never falls below
$1/\sqrt{2}$, a fact that is useful for quantum communication applications like
a quantum repeater. Using a novel quantification of mixed state entanglement,
we show that there are noise regimes where even though entanglement vanishes,
the state is still available for applications like NMR quantum computation,

overextension. Since the effect of overextension, analogue to the well-known
guppy effect for concept combinations, is abundant in all experiments testing
weights of items with respect to pairs of concepts and their conjunctions, our
theorem constitutes a no-go theorem for classical measure structure for common
data of membership weights of items with respect to concepts and their
combinations. We put forward a simple geometric criterion that reveals the non
classicality of the membership weight structure and use experimentally measured
membership weights estimated by subjects in experiments to illustrate our
geometrical criterion. The violation of the classical weight structure is
similar to the violation of the well-known Bell inequalities studied in quantum
mechanics, and hence suggests that the quantum formalism and hence the modeling
by quantum membership weights can accomplish what classical membership weights
cannot do.

  Economics, Decision theory and Concept Theory</title><description>  Inspired by a quantum mechanical formalism to model concepts and their
disjunctions and conjunctions, we put forward in this paper a specific
hypothesis. Namely that within human thought two superposed layers can be
distinguished: (i) a layer given form by an underlying classical deterministic
process, incorporating essentially logical thought and its indeterministic
version modeled by classical probability theory; (ii) a layer given form under
influence of the totality of the surrounding conceptual landscape, where the
different concepts figure as individual entities rather than (logical)
combinations of others, with measurable quantities such as 'typicality',
'membership', 'representativeness', 'similarity', 'applicability', 'preference'
or 'utility' carrying the influences. We call the process in this second layer
'quantum conceptual thought', which is indeterministic in essence, and contains
holistic aspects, but is equally well, although very differently, organized
than logical thought. A substantial part of the 'quantum conceptual thought
process' can be modeled by quantum mechanical probabilistic and mathematical
structures. We consider examples of three specific domains of research where
the effects of the presence of quantum conceptual thought and its deviations
from classical logical thought have been noticed and studied, i.e. economics,
decision theory, and concept theories and which provide experimental evidence
for our hypothesis.

Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP), predicted by theories of Quantum
Gravity, influence all quantum Hamiltonians. Thus, they predict quantum gravity
corrections to various quantum phenomena. We compute such corrections to the
Lamb Shift, the Landau levels and the tunnelling current in a Scanning
Tunnelling Microscope (STM). We show that these corrections can be interpreted
in two ways: (a) either that they are exceedingly small, beyond the reach of
current experiments, or (b) that they predict upper bounds on the quantum
gravity parameter in the GUP, compatible with experiments at the electroweak
scale. Thus, more accurate measurements in the future should either be able to
test these predictions, or further tighten the above bounds and predict an
intermediate length scale, between the electroweak and the Planck scale.

We show that, for any given distance $L$, the polynomial scaling of rate with

measurements on spatially separated systems cannot always be described by a
locally causal theory. In such a theory, the outcomes of local measurements are
determined in advance solely by some unknown (or hidden) variables and the
choice of local measurements. Correlations that are allowed within the
framework of a locally causal theory are termed classical. Typically, the fact
that quantum mechanics does not always result in classical correlations is
revealed by the violation of Bell inequalities, which are constraints that have
to be satisfied by any classical correlations. It has been known for a long
time that entanglement is necessary to demonstrate nonclassical correlations,
and hence a Bell inequality violation. However, since some entangled quantum
states are known to admit explicit locally causal models, the exact role of
entanglement in Bell inequality violation has remained obscure. This thesis
provides both a comprehensive review on these issues as well as a report on new
discoveries made to clarify the relationship between entanglement and Bell
inequality violation.

The optimal decompositions in the full range of parameter space are constructed

questions: Upcoming generations of quantum computers might already be too large
to be simulated classically. Is it possible to experimentally test that these
systems perform as they should, if we cannot efficiently compute predictions
for their behavior? Vazirani has asked: If predicting Quantum Mechanical
systems requires exponential resources, is QM a falsifiable theory? In
cryptographic settings, an untrusted future company wants to sell a quantum
computer or perform a delegated quantum computation. Can the customer be
convinced of correctness without the ability to compare results to predictions?
  To answer these questions, we define Quantum Prover Interactive Proofs
(QPIP). Whereas in standard Interactive Proofs the prover is computationally
unbounded, here our prover is in BQP, representing a quantum computer. The
verifier models our current computational capabilities: it is a BPP machine,
with access to few qubits. Our main theorem can be roughly stated as: &quot;Any
language in BQP has a QPIP, and moreover, a fault tolerant one&quot;. We provide two
proofs. The simpler one uses a new (possibly of independent interest) quantum
authentication scheme (QAS) based on random Clifford elements. This QPIP
however, is not fault tolerant. Our second protocol uses polynomial codes QAS
due to BCGHS, combined with quantum fault tolerance and multiparty quantum
computation techniques. A slight modification of our constructions makes the
protocol &quot;blind&quot;: the quantum computation and input are unknown to the prover.
  After we have derived the results, we have learned that Broadbent at al. have
independently derived &quot;universal blind quantum computation&quot; using completely
different methods. Their construction implicitly implies similar implications.

Such an optimal protocol is given by a prolate spheroidal wave function which
often appears in wavelet or time-limited Fourier analysis. Also, the minimum

detector using only a threshold detector together with a variable attenuator.
This idea is similar in spirit to that of the decoy state technique, and is
specially suited for those scenarios where only a few parameters of the photon
number statistics of the incoming signals have to be estimated. As an
illustration of the potential applicability of the method in quantum
communication protocols, we use it to prove security of an entanglement based
quantum key distribution scheme with an untrusted source without the need of a
squash model and by solely using this extra idea. In this sense, this detector
decoy method can be seen as a different conceptual approach to adapt a single
photon security proof to its physical, full optical implementation. We show
that in this scenario the legitimate users can now even discard the double
click events from the raw key data without compromising the security of the
scheme, and we present simulations on the performance of the BB84 and the
6-state quantum key distribution protocols.

characterization using a photon-number resolving, time-multiplexed detector

phase space via photon parity measurements and displacement operations,
replacing the conventional homodyne tomography. Our emphasis lies on
reconstructing the Wigner function of non-Gaussian Fock states with highly
negative values in a scheme that is based on a realistic experimental setup. In
order to establish the concept of loss-tolerance for state characterization we
show how losses can be decoupled from the impact of other experimental
imperfections, i.e. the non-unity transmittance of the displacement
beamsplitter and non-ideal mode overlap. We relate the experimentally
accessible parameters to effective ones that are needed for an optimised state
reconstruction. The feasibility of our approach is tested by Monte Carlo
simulations, which provide bounds resulting from statistical errors that are
due to limited data sets. Our results clearly show that high losses can be
accepted for a defined parameter range, and moreover, that (in contrast to
homodyne detection) mode mismatch results in a distinct signature, which can be
evaluated by analysing the photon number oscillations of the displaced Fock
states.

the corresponding theory is proposed. When electrons have identical

was performed using genetic algorithms. Our results show that the concurrence
of the optimized lattice structures is considerably higher than that of non

maximized when the system begins to dimerize, i.e. it undergoes a structural
phase transition (Peierls distortion). This result is consistent with the idea
that entanglement is maximal or shows a singularity near quantum phase
transitions and that quantum entanglement cannot be freely shared between many
objects (monogamy property). Moreover, the optimization of concurrence in
two-dimensional bipartite and non bipartite lattices is achieved when the
structures break into smaller subsystems, which are arranged in geometrically
distinguishable configurations. This behavior is again related to the monogamy

amenable to quantum computing. A formulation is employed in which the binary
classifier is constructed as a thresholded linear superposition of a set of
weak classifiers. The weights in the superposition are optimized in a learning
process that strives to minimize the training error as well as the number of
weak classifiers used. No efficient solution to this problem is known. To bring
it into a format that allows the application of adiabatic quantum computing
(AQC), we first show that the bit-precision with which the weights need to be
represented only grows logarithmically with the ratio of the number of training
examples to the number of weak classifiers. This allows to effectively
formulate the training process as a binary optimization problem. Solving it
with heuristic solvers such as tabu search, we find that the resulting
classifier outperforms a widely used state-of-the-art method, AdaBoost, on a
variety of benchmark problems. Moreover, we discovered the interesting fact
that bit-constrained learning machines often exhibit lower generalization error
rates. Changing the loss function that measures the training error from 0-1
loss to least squares maps the training to quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization. This corresponds to the format required by D-Wave's
implementation of AQC. Simulations with heuristic solvers again yield results
better than those obtained with boosting approaches. Since the resulting
quadratic binary program is NP-hard, additional gains can be expected from
applying the actual quantum processor.

schemes (FPRAS) for estimating partition functions that combine simulated
annealing with the Monte-Carlo Markov Chain method and use non-adaptive cooling
schedules. The improvement in time complexity is twofold: a quadratic reduction
with respect to the spectral gap of the underlying Markov chains and a
quadratic reduction with respect to the parameter characterizing the desired
accuracy of the estimate output by the FPRAS. Both reductions are intimately
related and cannot be achieved separately.
  First, we use Grover's fixed point search, quantum walks and phase estimation
to efficiently prepare approximate coherent encodings of stationary
distributions of the Markov chains. The speed-up we obtain in this way is due
to the quadratic relation between the spectral and phase gaps of classical and

how to estimate expected values of quantum observables. Using this method

  path integral for relativistic quantum physics</title><description>  With this paper, a consistent and comprehensive treatise on the foundations
of the extended Hamilton-Lagrange formalism will be presented. In this
formalism, the system's dynamics is parametrized along a time-like system
evolution parameter $s$, and the physical time $t$ is treated as a dependent
variable $t(s)$ on equal footing with all other configuration space variables
$q^{i}(s)$. In the action principle, the conventional classical action $L dt$
is then replaced by the generalized action $L_{e}ds$, with $L$ and $L_{e}$
denoting the conventional and the extended Lagrangian, respectively. In the
existing literature, the discussion is restricted to only those extended
Lagrangians $L_{e}$ that are homogeneous forms of first order in the
velocities.
  It is shown that a class of extended Lagrangians $L_{e}$ exists that are
correlated to corresponding conventional Lagrangians $L$ without being
homogeneous functions in the velocities. Then the Legendre transformation of
$L_{e}$ to an extended Hamiltonian $H_{e}$ exists. With this class of extended
Hamiltonians, an extended canonical formalism is presented that is completely
analogous to the conventional Hamiltonian formalism. The physical time $t$ and
the negative value of the conventional Hamiltonian then constitute and an
additional pair of conjugate canonical variables. The extended formalism also
includes a theory of extended canonical transformations, where the time
variable $t(s)$ is also subject to transformation.
  In the extended formalism, the system's dynamics is described as a motion on
a hypersurface within an extended phase space of even dimension. It is shown
that the hypersurface condition does not embody a constraint as the condition
is automatically satisfied on the system path that is given by the solution of
the extended set of canonical equations.

from quantum-degenerate atomic gases on a Feshbach resonance and subsequent
coherent optical multi-photon transfer into the rovibronic ground state. In
ultracold samples of Cs_2 molecules, we observe two-photon dark resonances that
connect the intermediate rovibrational level |v=73,J=2&gt; with the rovibrational

For precise dark resonance spectroscopy we exploit the fact that it is possible

theory of de Broglie and Bohm is really a many-worlds theory with a superfluous
configuration appended to one of the worlds. Assuming that pilot-wave theory
does contain an ontological pilot wave (a complex-valued field in configuration
space), we show that such claims arise from not interpreting pilot-wave theory
on its own terms. Specifically, the theory has its own ('subquantum') theory of
measurement, and in general describes a 'nonequilibrium' state that violates
the Born rule. Furthermore, in realistic models of the classical limit, one
does not obtain localised pieces of an ontological pilot wave following
alternative macroscopic trajectories: from a de Broglie-Bohm viewpoint,
alternative trajectories are merely mathematical and not ontological. Thus,
from the perspective of pilot-wave theory itself, many worlds are an illusion.
It is further argued that, even leaving pilot-wave theory aside, the theory of
many worlds is rooted in the intrinsically unlikely assumption that quantum
measurements should be modelled on classical measurements, and is therefore
unlikely to be true.

An Inquiry into Quantum and Classical Correlations</title><description>  ** The primary topic of this dissertation is the study of the relationships
between parts and wholes as described by particular physical theories, namely
generalized probability theories in a quasi-classical physics framework and
non-relativistic quantum theory.
  ** A large part of this dissertation is devoted to understanding different
aspects of four different kinds of correlations: local, partially-local,
no-signaling and quantum mechanical correlations. Novel characteristics of
these correlations have been used to study how they are related and how they
can be discerned via Bell-type inequalities that give non-trivial bounds on the
strength of the correlations.
  ** The study of quantum correlations has also prompted us to study a) the
multi-partite qubit state space with respect to its entanglement and
separability characteristics, and b) the differing strength of the correlations
in separable and entangled qubit states. Results include a novel classification
of multipartite (partial) separability and entanglement, strong constraints on
the monogamy of entanglement and of non-local correlations, and many new
entanglement detection criteria that are directly experimentally accessible.
  ** Because of the generality of the investigation these results also have
strong foundational as well as philosophical repercussions for the different
sorts of physical theories as a whole; notably for the viability of hidden
variable theories for quantum mechanics, for the possibility of doing
experimental metaphysics, for the question of holism in physical theories, and
for the classical vs. quantum dichotomy.

where a given computational job is converted to the task of finding the global
minimum of some classical potential energy function and the search for the
global potential minimum is performed by employing external kinetic quantum
fluctuations and subsequent slow reduction (annealing) of them. In this method,
the entire potential energy landscape (PEL) may be accessed simultaneously
through a delocalized wave-function, in contrast to a classical search, where
the searcher has to visit different points in the landscape (i.e., individual
classical configurations) sequentially. Thus in such searches, the role of the
potential energy might be significantly different in the two cases. Here we
discuss this in the context of searching of a single isolated hole (potential
minimum) in a golf-course type gradient free PEL. We show, that the quantum
particle would be able to locate the hole faster if the hole is deeper, while
the classical particle of course would have no scope to exploit the depth of
the hole. We also discuss the effect of the underlying quantum phase transition
on the adiabatic dynamics.

This provides a simple proof of the Gottesman-Knill theorem without resorting
to stabilizer techniques. The normal form highlights why Clifford circuits have
such limited computational power in spite of their high entangling power. At
the same time, the normal form shows how the classical simulation of Clifford
circuits fits into the standard way of embedding classical computation into the
quantum circuit model. This leads to simple extensions of Clifford circuits
which are classically simulatable. These circuits can be efficiently simulated
by classical sampling ('weak simulation') even though the problem of exactly
computing the outcomes of measurements for these circuits ('strong simulation')
is proved to be #P-complete--thus showing that there is a separation between
weak and strong classical simulation of quantum computation.

from its beginnings until now. The consequences of the apparent differences
between quantum statistics and classical statistics range from the
philosophical interpretations to practical issues as quantum computing. In this
note we demonstrate how quantum mechanics can emerge from classical statistical
systems. We discuss conditions and circumstances for this to happen. Quantum
systems describe isolated subsystems of classical statistical systems with
infinitely many states. While infinitely many classical observables &quot;measure&quot;
properties of the subsystem and its environment, the state of the subsystem can
be characterized by the expectation values of only a few probabilistic
observables. They define a density matrix, and all the usual laws of quantum
mechanics follow. No concepts beyond classical statistics are needed for
quantum physics - the differences are only apparent and result from the
particularities of those classical statistical systems which admit a quantum
mechanical description. In particular, we show how the non-commuting properties
of quantum operators are associated to the use of conditional probabilities
within the classical system, and how a unitary time evolution reflects the
isolation of the subsystem.

Whereas in the arbitrary, not necessarily unital case they form a proper subset

Bose gas in a random potential are studied. We calculate geometrical and
energetic characteristics of the localized state of a gas confined in a large
box or in a harmonic trap. Different regimes of the localized state are found
depending on the ratio of two characteristic length scales of the disorder, the
Larkin length and the disorder correlation length. Repulsing bosons confined in
a large box with average density $n$ well below a critical value $n_c$ are
trapped in deep potential wells of extension much smaller than distance between
them. Tunneling between these wells is exponentially small. The ground state of
such a gas is a random singlet with no long-range phase correlation For $n&gt;n_c$
repulsion between particles overcomes the disorder and the gas transits from
the localized to a coherent superfluid state. The critical density $n_c$ is
calculated in terms of the disorder parameters and the interaction strength.
For atoms in traps four different regimes are found, only one of it is
superfluid. The theory is extended to lower (1 and 2) dimensions. Its
quantitative predictions can be checked in experiments with ultracold atomic
gases and other Bose-systems.

  field</title><description>  We investigate the entanglement between two separated segments in the vacuum
state of a free 1D Klein-Gordon field, where explicit computations are
performed in the continuum limit of the linear harmonic chain. We show that the
entanglement, which we measure by the logarithmic negativity, is finite with no
further need for renormalization. We find that the quantum correlations decay
much faster than the classical correlations as in the critical limit long range
entanglement decays exponentially for separations larger than the size of the
segments. As the segments become closer to each other the entanglement diverges
as a power law. The noncritical regime manifests richer behavior, as the
entanglement depends both on the size of the segments and on their separation.
In correspondence with the von Neumann entropy long-range entanglement also
distinguishes critical from noncritical systems.

  Optical Cavity Using Degenerate Optical Modes</title><description>  Optomechanical devices in which a flexible SiN membrane is placed inside an
optical cavity allow for very high finesse and mechanical quality factor in a
single device. They also provide fundamentally new functionality: the cavity
detuning can be a quadratic function of membrane position. This enables a
measurement of &quot;position squared&quot; ($x^2$) and in principle a QND phonon number
readout of the membrane. However, the readout achieved using a single
transverse cavity mode is not sensitive enough to observe quantum jumps between
phonon Fock states.
  Here we demonstrate an $x^2$-sensitivity that is orders of magnitude stronger
using two transverse cavity modes that are nearly degenerate. We derive a
first-order perturbation theory to describe the interactions between
nearly-degenerate cavity modes and achieve good agreement with our measurements
using realistic parameters. We also demonstrate theoretically that the
$x^2$-coupling should be easily tunable over a wide range.

unitary transformations, to what extent is it possible to discriminate amongst
them?&quot; We investigate this for the Deutsch-Jozsa problem. The task of
discriminating amongst the admissible oracle unitary transformations results in
an exhaustive collection of algorithms which can solve the problem with

process in rubidium vapor at 795 nm to demonstrate generation of

This paper will discuss the quantum properties of amplifiers based on

experiment. The coupling of the coherent electrons to the quantized
electromagnetic field illustrates all of these versions of decoherence. This
decoherence has two equivalent interpretations, in terms of photon emission or
in terms of Aharonov-Bohm phase fluctuations. We consider the case when the
coherent electrons are coupled to photons in a squeezed vacuum state. The
time-averaged result is increased decoherence. However, if only electrons which
are emitted during selected periods are counted, the decoherence can be
suppressed below the level for the photon vacuum. This is the phenomenon of
recoherence. This effect is closely related to the quantum violations of the
weak energy condition, and is restricted by similar inequalities. We give some
estimates of the magnitude of the recoherence effect and discuss prospects for
observing it in an electron interferometry experiment.

  Perturbation theory and the impact of derivative terms</title><description>  We study the dynamics of bright and dark matter-wave solitons in the presence
of a spatially varying nonlinearity. When the spatial variation does not
involve zero crossings, a transformation is used to bring the problem to a
standard nonlinear Schrodinger form, but with two additional terms: an
effective potential one and a non-potential term. We illustrate how to apply
perturbation theory of dark and bright solitons to the transformed equations.
We develop the general case, but primarily focus on the non-standard special
case whereby the potential term vanishes, for an inverse square spatial
dependence of the nonlinearity. In both cases of repulsive and attractive
interactions, appropriate versions of the soliton perturbation theory are shown
to accurately describe the soliton dynamics.

existence of a new type of mode associated with the &quot;swapping&quot; of the two

macroscopic quantum self-trapping (MQST) solutions, the swapping modes
correspond to the tunneling dynamics that preserves the symmetry of the double

phases where the two species localize in the different potential welils or
coexist in the same well, the corresponding symmetry restoring swapping modes
result in dynamics where the the two species either avoid or chase each other.
In view of the possibility to control the interaction between the species, the

However, there is a higher order sum rule that quantum mechanics does obey,

time dependent variational principle applied to coherent states associated to
SU(2) group. Employing a two-mode local approximation and hard sphere type
interaction, we show in the Schwinger's pseudo-spin language the occurrence of
a fixed point bifurcation that originates a separatrix of motion on a sphere.
This separatrix corresponds to the borderline between two dynamical regimes of
Josephson oscillations and mesoscopic self-trapping. We also consider the
effects of interaction between particles in different wells, known as cross
collisions. Such terms are usually neglected for traps sufficiently far apart,
but recently it has been shown that they contribute to the effective tunneling
constant with a factor growing linearly with the particle number. This effect
changes considerably the effective tunneling of the system for sufficiently
large number of trapped atoms, in perfect accord with experimental data.
Finally, we identify analytically the transition parameter associated to the
bifurcation in the generalized phase space of the model with cross-collision
terms, and show how the dynamical regime depends on the initial conditions of
the system and the collisional parameters values.

initial density operators $\lambda$ and $r$, respectively, we consider most
general interactions, which lead to transferring certain matrix elements of
unknown $\lambda$ into those of the final state ${\widetilde r}$ of B. We find
that this process leads to eliminating the memory on the transferred (or
certain other) matrix elements from the final state of A. If one diagonal
matrix element is transferred: ${\widetilde r}_{aa}=\lambda_{aa}$, the memory
on each non-diagonal element $\lambda_{a\not=b}$ is completely eliminated from
the final density operator of A. The transfer of a non-diagonal element:
${\widetilde r}_{ab}=\lambda_{ab}$ eliminates the memory on the diagonal
elements $\lambda_{aa}$ and $\lambda_{bb}$, while the memory about their sum
$\lambda_{aa}+\lambda_{bb}$ is kept. Moreover, the memory about $\lambda_{ab}$
itself is completely eliminated from the final state of A. Generalization of
these set-ups to non-ideal transfer brings in a trade-off between the quality
of the transfer and the amount of preserved memory. This trade-off is expressed
via system-independent uncertainty relations.

However, a configuration is created in which one cannot tell anymore which

non-factorizable, symmetrical (for bosons) or antisymmetrical (for fermions).
In part of the cases the situation is even more surprising: the particles never

atom. The leading edge of the pulse exerts a dispersive force on the atom, and
this modifies the atomic momentum while the atom is enveloped in the light. The
standard view of the optical dipole force indicates that red-detuned light
should attract the atom towards high intensity. This should increase the
average momentum per photon to $\textbf{p}_{0} n$, where $\textbf{p}_{0}$ is
the photon momentum in free space and $n$ is the average refractive index due
to the presence of the atom in the light. We show, however, that this is the
wrong conclusion and that the atom is in fact repelled from the light by the
dispersive forces, giving the photons a momentum $\textbf{p}_{0} /n$. This
leads us to identify Abraham's optical momentum with the kinetic momentum
transfer. The form due to Minkowski is similarly associated with the canonical
momentum. We consider the possibility of demonstrating this in the laboratory,

quickly establishes a high quality entanglement between the spins at the
opposite ends of the chain. This entanglement is mediated by the Kondo Cloud,
attains a constant high value independent of the length for large chains, and
shows thermal robustness. In contrast, when the Kondo cloud is absent, e.g. in
the gapped dimer regime, only finite size end to end effects can create some
entanglement on a much longer time-scale for rather short chains. By decoupling
one end of the chain during the dynamics one can distinguish between this
end-end effect which vanishes, and the global Kondo cloud mediated
entanglement, which persists. This quench approach paves the way to detect the
elusive Kondo cloud through the entanglement between two individual spins. Our

spin-1/2 particles that can be used for encoding a single logical qubit in the
two-fold singlet subspace, insensitive to uniform magnetic field fluctuations
in any direction. Dynamical manipulation of the supperlattice yields distinct
inter and intra plaquette interactions and permits to realize one qubit and two
qubit gates with high fidelity, leading to the generation of universal cluster
states for measurement based quantum computation. Our proposal based on inter

by means of alternative models of atom-reservoir interaction. Agreement with
experimental Rabi oscillation data can be obtained if one defines jump
operators in the dressed-state basis, and takes into account thermal
fluctuations between dressed states belonging to the same manifold. Such
low-frequency transitions could be ignored in a closed cavity, but the cavity
employed in the experiment was open, which justifies our assumption. The cavity
quality factor corresponding to the data is $Q=3.31\cdot 10^{10}$, whereas $Q$
reported in the experiment was $Q=7\cdot 10^7$. The rate of decoherence arising
from opening of the cavity can be of the same order as an analogous correction
coming from finite time resolution $\Delta t$ (formally equivalent to
collisional decoherence). Peres-Horodecki separability criterion shows that the
rate at which the atom-field state approaches a separable state is controlled
by fluctuations between dressed states from the same manifold, and not by the
rate of transitions towards the ground state. In consequence, improving the $Q$
factor we do not improve the coherence properties of the cavity.

Bell's theorem is based on the assumptions of realism, locality, and the
freedom to choose between measurement settings. In experimental tests,
&quot;loopholes&quot; arise which allow observed violations to still be explained by
local realistic theories. Violating Bell's inequality while simultaneously

have a long history. The ultimate goal is to find exponential separations for
computational problems. However, such separations do not come a dime a dozen:
while there were some early successes in the form of hidden subgroup problems
for abelian groups--which generalize Shor's factoring algorithm perhaps most
faithfully--only for a handful of non-abelian groups efficient quantum
algorithms were found. Recently, problems have gotten increased attention that
seek to identify hidden sub-structures of other combinatorial and algebraic
objects besides groups. In this paper we provide new examples for exponential
separations by considering hidden shift problems that are defined for several
classes of highly non-linear Boolean functions. These so-called bent functions
arise in cryptography, where their property of having perfectly flat Fourier
spectra on the Boolean hypercube gives them resilience against certain types of
attack. We present new quantum algorithms that solve the hidden shift problems
for several well-known classes of bent functions in polynomial time and with a
constant number of queries, while the classical query complexity is shown to be
exponential. Our approach uses a technique that exploits the duality between
bent functions and their Fourier transforms.

Gaussian states in the single-copy and many-copy regimes. Specifically, we
focus on displaced thermal and squeezed thermal states. We find that while for
displaced thermal states an increase in temperature reduces the estimation
fidelity, for squeezed thermal states a larger temperature can enhance the
estimation fidelity. The many-copy optimal bounds are compared with the minimum
variance achieved by three important single-shot measurement strategies. We
show that the single-copy canonical phase measurement does not always attain
the optimal bounds in the many-copy scenario. Adaptive homodyning schemes do
attain the bounds for displaced thermal states, but for squeezed states they
yield fidelities that are insensitive to temperature variations and are,
therefore, sub-optimal. Finally, we find that heterodyne measurements perform
very poorly for pure states but can attain the optimal bounds for sufficiently
mixed states. We apply our results to investigate the influence of losses in an
optical metrology experiment. In the presence of losses squeezed states cease
to provide Heisenberg limited precision and their performance is close to that

Hamiltonians - each local Hamiltonian specifies a local constraint whose
violation contributes to the energy of the given quantum state. Formalizing the
intuitive connection between the ground (minimal) energy of the Hamiltonian and
the minimum number of violated constraints is problematic, since the number of
constraints being violated is not well defined when the terms in the
Hamiltonian do not commute. The detectability lemma proved in this paper
provides precisely such a quantitative connection. We apply the lemma to derive
a quantum analogue of a basic primitive in classical complexity: amplification
of probabilities by random walks on expander graphs. It holds under the
restriction that the interaction graph of the local Hamiltonian is an expander.
Our proofs are based on a novel structure imposed on the Hilbert space that we
call the $XY$ decomposition, which enables a reduction from the quantum
non-commuting case to the commuting case (where many classical arguments go
through).
  The results may have several interesting implications. First, proving a
quantum analogue to the PCP theorem is one of the most important challenges in
quantum complexity theory. Our quantum gap amplification lemma may be viewed as
the quantum analogue of the first of the three main steps in Dinur's PCP proof.
Quantum gap amplification may also be related to spectral gap amplification,
and in particular, to fault tolerance of adiabatic computation. Finally, the
detectability lemma, and the $XY$ decomposition provide a handle on the
structure of local Hamiltonians and their ground states.

Lett. 100, 240404 (2008)]. The biexction decay via intermediate polariton
states can be used to overcome the natural splitting between the exciton states
coupled to the horizontally and vertically polarized light modes, so that high
degrees of entanglement can be expected. We investigate theoretically the
features of realistic dot-cavity systems, including the effect of the different
oscillator strength of excitons resonances coupled to the different
polarizations of light. We show that in this case, an independent adjustment of
the cavity resonances is needed in order to keep a high entanglement degree. We
also consider the case when the biexciton-exciton transition is also strongly
coupled to a cavity mode. We show that a very fast emission rate can be
achieved allowing the repetition rates in the THz range. Such fast emission
should however be paid for by a very complex tuning of the many strongly
coupled resonances involved and by a loss of quantum efficiency. Altogether a
strongly coupled dot-cavity system seems to be very promising as a source of
entangled photon pairs.

First, we find an additional power-law dependence of the tunneling probability

tunneling. The second signature is substantial widening of the probability
distribution over final-state quantum numbers. These effects are studied using
modified semiclassical technique which incorporates stabilization of the

subtle issue. One possible route is based on the thermodynamic partition
function which is the ratio of the partition functions of system plus bath and
of the bath alone. For the free damped particle it has been shown, however,
that the ensuing specific heat may become negative for appropriately chosen
environments. Being an open system this quantity then naturally must be
interpreted as the change of the specific heat obtained as the difference
between the specific heat of the heat bath coupled to the system degrees of
freedom and the specific heat of the bath alone. While this difference may
become negative, the involved specific heats themselves are always positive;
thus, the known thermodynamic stability criteria are perfectly guaranteed. For
a damped quantum harmonic oscillator, instead of negative values, under
appropriate conditions one can observe a dip in the difference of specific
heats as a function of temperature. Stylized minimal models containing a single
oscillator heat bath are employed to elucidate the occurrence of the anomalous
temperature dependence of the corresponding specific heat values. Moreover, we

$\Lambda=\Lambda_{1}-\Lambda_{2}$, we propose a possible way to generalize the

generalized majorization relation and the concept of the Schur--concave

is important is that, contrary to the Nielsen--Kempe majorization criterion and
entropic inequalities, our criteria allow for the detection of entangled states

also point out that if a state with at least one maximally mixed subsystem is
detected by some necessary criterion based on the positive map $\Lambda$, then
there exist entropic inequalities derived from $\Lambda$ (by both procedures)
that also detect this state. In this sense, they are equivalent to the
necessary criterion $[I\ot\Lambda](\varrho_{AB})\geq 0$. Moreover, our
inequalities provide a way of constructing multi--copy entanglement witnesses
and therefore are promising from the experimental point of view. Finally, we
discuss some of the derived inequalities in the context of recently introduced
protocol of state merging and possibility of approximating the mean value of a
linear entanglement witness.

that classical physics accustomed us to consider as valid. By relating the
phenomenon of quantum nonseparability to the all-important concept of
potentiality, we effectively provide a coherent picture of the puzzling
entangled correlations among spatially separated systems. We further argue that
the generalized phenomenon of quantum nonseparability implies contextuality for
the production of well-defined events in the quantum domain, whereas
contextuality entails in turn a structural-relational conception of quantal
objects, viewed as carriers of dispositional properties. It is finally
suggested that contextuality, if considered as a conditionalization preparation
procedure of the object to be measured, naturally leads to a separable concept
of reality whose elements are experienced as distinct, well-localized objects
having determinate properties. In this connection, we find it necessary to
distinguish the meaning of the term reality from the criterion of reality for

dissipation-free bosonic systems has lead to many spectacular observations,
ranging from the demonstration of number-phase uncertainty relation to quantum
phase transitions. To explore the effect of dissipation and coherent drive on
tunnel coupled interacting bosonic systems, we propose a device that is the
quantum optical analog of a Josephson interferometer. It consists of two
coherently driven linear optical cavities connected via a central cavity with a
single-photon nonlinearity. The Josephson-like oscillations in the light
emitted from the central cavity as a function of the phase difference between
two pumping fields can be suppressed by increasing the strength of the
nonlinear coupling. Remarkably, we find that in the limit of ultra-strong
interactions in the center-cavity, the coupled system maps on to an effective
Jaynes-Cummings system with a nonlinearity determined by the tunnel coupling
strength. In the limit of a single nonlinear cavity coupled to two linear
waveguides, the degree of photon antibunching from the nonlinear cavity
provides an excellent measure of the transition to the nonlinear regime where
Josephson oscillations are suppressed.

another kind and the total number of particles varies in time. The theory thus
extends the scope of the available and successful multiconfigurational
time-dependent Hartree methods -- which were solely formulated for and applied
to systems with a fixed number of particles -- to new physical systems and
problems. As a guiding example we treat explicitly a system where bosonic atoms
can combine to form bosonic molecules and vise versa. In the theory for
particle conversion, the time-dependent many-particle wavefunction is written
as a sum of configurations made of a different number of particles, and
assembled from sets of atomic and molecular orbitals. Both the expansion
coefficients and the orbitals forming the configurations are time-dependent
quantities that are fully determined according to the Dirac-Frenkel
time-dependent variational principle. Particular attention is paid to the
reduced density matrices of the many-particle wavefunction that appear in the
theory and enter the equations of motion. There are two kinds of reduced
density matrices: particle-conserving reduced density matrices which directly
only couple configurations with the same number of atoms and molecules, and
particle non-conserving reduced density matrices which couple configurations
with a different number of atoms and molecules. Closed-form and compact
equations of motion are derived for contact as well as general two-body

  condensate via an optical lattice: Extended Mott-superfluid transitions</title><description>  An ultracold gas of coupled two-component atoms in an optical field is
studied. Due to the internal two-level structure of the atoms, three competing
energy terms exist; atomic kinetic, atomic internal, and atom-atom interaction
energies. A novel outcome of this interplay, not present in the regular
Bose-Hubbard model, is that in the single band and tight binding approximations
four different phases appear: two superfluid and two Mott phases. When passing
through the critical point between the two superfluid or the two Mott phases, a
swapping of the internal atomic populations takes place. By means of the strong
coupling expansion, we find the full phase diagram for the four different
phases.

quantum computation due to their simplicity and robustness to noise. By
definition, transversal operators do not couple physical subsystems within the
same code block. Consequently, such operators do not spread errors within code
blocks and are, therefore, fault tolerant. Nonetheless, other methods of
ensuring fault tolerance are required, as it is invariably the case that some
encoded gates cannot be implemented transversally. This observation has led to
a long-standing conjecture that transversal encoded gate sets cannot be
universal. Here we show that the ability of a quantum code to detect an
arbitrary error on any single physical subsystem is incompatible with the
existence of a universal, transversal encoded gate set for the code.

  We show that any quantum algorithm in the continuous-time query model whose

immediately carries over to a lower bound of \Omega[T log(log(T))/log (T)] in

appealing example of a quantum walk because it has a natural implementation on
a register on $n$ qubits. However, any real implementation will encounter
decoherence effects due to interactions with uncontrollable degrees of freedom.
We present a complete characterization of the mixing properties of the
hypercube QRW under a physically relevant Markovian decoherence model. In the
local decoherence model considered the non-unitary dynamics are modeled as a
sum of projections on individual qubits to an arbitrary direction on the Bloch
sphere. We prove that there is always classical (asymptotic) mixing in this
model and specify the conditions under which instantaneous mixing
\textit{always} exists. And we show that the latter mixing property, as well as
the classical mixing time, depend heavily on the exact environmental
interaction and its strength. Therefore, algorithmic applications of the QRW on
the hypercube, if they intend to employ mixing properties, need to consider
both the walk dynamics and the precise decoherence model.

  of spin anti-correlated states</title><description>  It is well established that an entanglement encoded in the Bell states of a
two-qubit system with correlated spins exhibits completely different evolution
properties than that encoded in states with the anti-correlated spins. A
complete and abrupt loss of the entanglement, called the entanglement sudden
death, can be found to occur for the spin correlated states, but the
entanglement evolves without any discontinuity or decays asymptotically for the
spin anti-correlated states. We consider the evolution of an initial
entanglement encoded in the spin anti-correlated states and demonstrate that
the asymptotic behavior predicted before occurs only in the weak coupling limit
or equivalently when the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) is made on the
interaction Hamiltonian of the qubits with the field. If we do not restrict
ourselves to the RWA, we find that the entanglement undergoes a discontinuity,
the sudden death phenomenon. We illustrate this behavior by employing an
efficient scheme for entanglement evolution between two cold-trapped atoms
located inside a single-mode cavity. Although only a single excitation is
initially present in the system, we find that the two-photon excited state,
which plays the key role for the discontinuity in the behavior of the
entanglement, gains a population over a short time of the evolution. When the
RWA is made on the interaction, the two-photon excited state remains
unpopulated for all times and the discontinuity is absent. We attribute this
phenomenon to the principle of complementarity between the evolution time and
energy, and the presence of the counter-rotating terms in the interaction
Hamiltonian.

coherent control of up to three individual nuclei in a dense nuclear spin
cluster is feasible. The free induction decays of nuclear spin Bell states and
single nuclear coherences among 13C nuclear spins are compared and analyzed.
Reduction of a free induction decay time T2* and a coherence time T2 upon
increase of nuclear spin concentration has been found. For diamond material
with depleted concentration of nuclear spin, T2* as long as 30 microseconds and
T2 of up to 1.8 ms for the electron spin has been observed. The 13C
concentration dependence of T2* is explained by Fermi contact and dipolar
interactions with nuclei in the lattice. It has been found that T2 decreases
approximately as 1/n, where n is 13C concentration, as expected for an electron
spin interacting with a nuclear spin bath.

apparatus by letting it interact with an auxiliary, &quot;Ancilla&quot;, system as
proposed by Allahverdyan, Balian and Nieuwenhuizen [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 120402
(2004)]. In the case of two qubits, this procedure allows to reconstruct the
initial state of the qubit of interest S by measuring three commuting
observables and therefore by means of a single apparatus, for the total system
S + A at a later time. The determinant of the matrix of the linear
transformation connecting the measurements of three commuting observables at
time t &gt; 0 to the components of the polarization vector of S at time t = 0 is
used as an indicator of the reconstructability of the initial state of the
system S. We show that a connection between the entanglement entropy of the
total system S + A and such a determinant exists, and that for a pure state a
vanishing entanglement individuates, without a need for any measurement, those
intervals of time for which the reconstruction procedure is least efficient.
This property remains valid for a generic dimension of S. In the case of a
mixed state this connection is lost.

  Spin Chain</title><description>  We study the transmission of both classical or quantum information through
all the phases of a finite XXZ spin chain. This characterizes the merit of the
different phases in terms of their ability to act as a quantum wire. As far as
quantum information is concerned, we need only consider the transmission of
entanglement as the direct transmission of a quantum state is equivalent. The
isotropic anti-ferromagnetic spin chain is found to be the optimal point of the
phase diagram for the transmission of quantum entanglement when one considers
both the amount of transmitted entanglement, as well as the velocity with which
it is transmitted. But this optimal point in the phase diagram moves to the
Neel phase when decoherence or thermal fluctuations are taken to account. This
chain may also be able to transfer classical information even when, due to a
large magnitude of the noise, quantum information is not transmitted at all.
For a certain range of anisotropies of the model, a curious feature is found in
the flow of quantum information inside the chain, namely, a hopping mode of
entanglement transfer which skips the odd numbered sites. Our predictions will
potentially be testable in several physical systems.

  with inhomogeneous magnetic field</title><description>  As a nuclear spin model of scalable quantum register, the one-dimensional
chain of the magnetic atoms with nuclear spins 1/2 substituting the basic atoms
in the plate of nuclear spin free easy-axis 3D antiferromagnet is considered.
It is formulated the generalized antiferromagnet Hamiltonian in spin-wave
approximation (low temperatures) considering the inhomogeneous external
magnetic field, which is directed along the easy axis normally to plane of the
plate and has a constant gradient along the nuclear spin chain. Assuming a weak
gradient, the asymptotic expression for coefficients of unitary transformations
to the diagonal form of antiferromagnet Hamiltonian is found. With this result
the expression for indirect interspin coupling, which is due to hyperfine
nuclear electron coupling in atoms and the virtual spin wave propagation in
antiferromagnet ground state, was evaluated.
  It is shown that the inhomogeneous magnetic field essentially modifies the
characteristics of indirect interspin coupling. The indirect interaction
essentially grows and even oscillates in relation to the interspin distance
when the local field value in the middle point of two considered nuclear spin
is close to the critical field for quantum phase transition of spin-flop type
in bulk antiferromagnet or close to antiferromagnetic resonance. Thus, the
external magnetic field, its gradient, microwave frequency and power can play
the role of control parameters for qubit states.
  Finally, the one and two qubit states decoherence and longitudinal relaxation
rate are caused by the interaction of nuclear spins with virtual spin waves in
antiferromagnet ground state are calculated.

  physics</title><description>  The descriptions of the quantum realm and the macroscopic classical world
differ significantly not only in their mathematical formulations but also in
their foundational concepts and philosophical consequences. When and how
physical systems stop to behave quantum mechanically and begin to behave
classically is still heavily debated in the physics community and subject to
theoretical and experimental research.
  This dissertation puts forward an approach to the quantum-to-classical
transition fully within quantum theory and conceptually different from already
existing models: It neither needs to refer to the uncontrollable environment of
a system (decoherence) nor to change the quantum laws itself (collapse models),
but puts the stress on the limits of observability of quantum phenomena due to
the imprecision of our measurement apparatuses. For a certain class of time
evolutions it is this mere restriction to coarse-grained measurements which is
sufficient to see the natural emergence of macroscopic realism and even the
classical Newtonian laws out of the full quantum formalism. But there also
exist &quot;non-classical&quot; Hamiltonians for which a classical spatiotemporal
description of the system's time evolution remains impossible even under fuzzy
measurements or decoherence. It is argued that such Hamiltonians are unlikely
to be spontaneously realized in nature because of their high complexity.
  The last part addresses the question of the origin of quantum randomness and
proposes a link with mathematical undecidability.

scattered within an open entrance channel-- the state observable at infinity,
they may enter an intermediate closed channel -- the locally bounded state of
the nuclei. If the energy of a bound state of in the closed channel is
fine-tuned to match the relative kinetic energy, then the open channel and the
closed channel &quot;resonate&quot;, so that the scattering length becomes divergent. We
find that this so-called Feshbach resonance phenomenon not only exists during
the collisions of massive particles, but also emerges during the coherent
transport of massless particles, that is, photons confined in the coupled
resonator arrays \cite{lzhou08}. We implement the open and the closed channels
inside a pair of such arrays, linked by a separated cavity or a tunable qubit.
When a single photon is bounded inside the closed channel by setting the
relevant physical parameters appropriately, the vanishing transmission appears
to display this photonic Feshbach resonance. The general construction can be
implemented through various experimentally feasible solid state systems, such
as the couple defected cavities in photonic crystals. The numerical simulation
based on finite-different time-domain(FDTD) method confirms our conceive about
physical implementation.

a weak measurement of the collective qubit inversion. As an example of this
result, we focus on the case of two qubits and show how this measurement can be
used to generate an entangled state from an initially separable state. This is
realized without relying on an entangling Hamiltonian. We show that, for {\em

this approach can be used to generate highly entangled states. This scheme
takes advantage of the fact that one of the Bell states is decoherence-free

compared with the evolution of the system when the initial state is such

that, in the dispersive regime, when the modulation periodicity is tuned to the

resonant Jaynes-Cummings or resonant Anti-Jaynes-Cummings behaviors, and it can

to the one occurring for a stationary two-level atom in a vibrating cavity, and
an entangled state with two photons can be created from vacuum. Moreover, we

network is crucial for the successful implementation of various quantum
communication protocols such as quantum cryptography, teleportation and dense
coding [1-3]. However, owing to the unavoidable loss in any real optical
channel, the distribution of loss-intolerant entangled states is inevitably
inflicted by decoherence, which causes a degradation of the transmitted
entanglement. To combat the decoherence, entanglement distillation, which is
the process of extracting a small set of highly entangled states from a large
set of less entangled states, can be used [4-14]. Here we report on the
mesoscopic distillation of deterministically prepared entangled light pulses
that have undergone non-Gaussian noise. The entangled light pulses [15-17] are
sent through a lossy channel, where the transmission is varying in time
similarly to light propagation in the atmosphere. By employing linear optical
components and global classical communication, the entanglement is
probabilistically increased.

challenge in the field of quantum information. Optical losses, phase diffusion
and mixing with thermal states lead to decoherence and destroy the
non-classical states after some finite transmission-line length. Quantum
repeater protocols, which combine quantum memory, entanglement distillation and
entanglement swapping, were proposed to overcome this problem. Here we report
on the experimental demonstration of entanglement distillation in the
continuous-variable regime. Entangled states were first disturbed by random
phase fluctuations and then distilled and purified using interference on beam
splitters and homodyne detection. Measurements of covariance matrices clearly
indicate a regained strength of entanglement and purity of the distilled
states. In contrast to previous demonstrations of entanglement distillation in
the complementary discrete-variable regime, our scheme achieved the actual
preparation of the distilled states, which might therefore be used to improve
the quality of downstream applications such as quantum teleportation.

both $L_1=\dot{q}^2$ and $L_2=e^\dot{q}$ are suitable Lagrangians on a

formulation gives transition probability amplitude which is free of any
Lagrangian/Hamiltonian and requires just the underlying classical equations of

clustering, and then develop a quantum-game-based clustering algorithm, in
which data points in a dataset are considered as players who can make decisions
and implement quantum strategies in quantum games. After each round of a
quantum game, each player's expected payoff is calculated. Later, he uses a
link-removing-and-rewiring (LRR) function to change his neighbors and adjust
the strength of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoff.
Further, algorithms are discussed and analyzed in two cases of strategies, two
payoff matrixes and two LRR functions. Consequently, the simulation results
have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and
efficiently, and the clustering algorithms have fast rates of convergence.
Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of
the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

example of fluctuation-induced long-ranged force acting on objects (conducting
plates) immersed in a fluctuating medium (quantum electromagnetic field in
vacuum). A similar effect emerges in statistical physics, where the force
acting, e.g., on colloidal particles immersed in a binary liquid mixture is
affected by the classical thermal fluctuations occurring in the surrounding
medium. The resulting Casimir-like force acquires universal features upon
approaching a critical point of the medium and becomes long-ranged at
criticality. In turn, this universality allows one to investigate theoretically
the temperature dependence of the force via representative models and to
stringently test the corresponding predictions in experiments. In contrast to
QED, the Casimir force resulting from critical fluctuations can be easily tuned
with respect to strength and sign by surface treatments and temperature
control. We present some recent advances in the theoretical study of the
universal properties of the critical Casimir force arising in thin films. The
corresponding predictions compare very well with the experimental results
obtained for wetting layers of various fluids. We discuss how the Casimir force
between a colloidal particle and a planar wall immersed in a binary liquid
mixture has been measured with femto-Newton accuracy, comparing these
experimental results with the corresponding theoretical predictions.

production occurs in two well-separated (median impact parameters of 20 and 40

interferometer. At low transverse momenta, the two amplitudes interfere
destructively, suppressing $\rho^0$ production. Since the $\rho^0$ decay before

generalized quantum potential (in which the constant is no longer reduced to
the standard quantum constant hbar) is equivalent to a generalized Schrodinger
equation. Then we show that, even in the case of the presence of vorticity, it
is also possible to obtain, for a large class of systems, a Schrodinger-like
equation of the vectorial field type from the continuity and Euler equations
including a quantum potential. The same kind of transformation also applies to
a classical charged fluid subjected to an electromagnetic field and to an
additional potential having the form of a quantum potential. Such a fluid can
therefore be described by an equation of the Ginzburg-Landau type, and is
expected to show some superconducting-like properties. Moreover, a Schrodinger
form can be obtained for the fluctuating rotational motion of a solid. In this
case the mass is replaced by the tensor of inertia, and a generalized form of
the quantum potential is derived. We finally reconsider the case of a standard
diffusion process, and we show that, after a change of variable, the diffusion
equation can also be given the form of a continuity and Euler system including
an additional potential energy. Since this potential is exactly the opposite of
a quantum potential, the quantum behavior may be considered, in this context,
as an anti-diffusion.

single mode of the quantized electromagnetic field. When the system is subject
to the Markovian atomic dephasing reservoir, the anti-rotating term leads to
the photon generation from vacuum. In the presence of Markovian damping
reservoirs, the asymptotic mean photon number is higher than the thermal photon
number expected in the absence of the anti-rotating term. We obtain approximate
analytical expressions in the asymptotic regime for the photon creation rate in
the pure dephasing case and the mean photon number and the atomic population
inversion in the general case. Our analytical results are valid in the small
mean photon number limit and they were tested by numerical analyses.

two dimensional honeycomb lattice configuration. It has been known for more
than sixty years that the electronic structure of graphene can be modelled by
two-dimensional massless relativistic fermions. This property gives rise to
numerous applications, both in applied sciences and in theoretical physics.
Electronic circuits made out of graphene could take advantage of its high
electron mobility that is witnessed even at room temperature. In the
theoretical domain the Dirac-like behavior of graphene can simulate high energy
effects, such as the relativistic Klein paradox. Even more surprisingly,
topological effects can be encoded in graphene such as the generation of
vortices, charge fractionalization and the emergence of anyons. The impact of
the topological effects on graphene's electronic properties can be elegantly
described by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. Here we present a pedagogical
encounter of this theorem and review its various applications to graphene. A
direct consequence of the index theorem is charge fractionalization that is
usually known from the fractional quantum Hall effect. The charge
fractionalization gives rise to the exciting possibility of realizing graphene
based anyons that unlike bosons or fermions exhibit fractional statistics.
Besides being of theoretical interest, anyons are a strong candidate for
performing error free quantum information processing.

A single optical probe beam scatters sequentially from the two cavities and the
continuous parity measurement is realized via fixed quadrature homodyne
photo-detection. We present models based on quantum stochastic differential

Performance of the cavity QED scheme is studied via numerical simulation with

  recoil-induced resonances</title><description>  We use an optically dense, anisotropic magneto-optical trap to study
recoil-induced resonances (RIRs) in the transient, high-gain regime. We find
that two distinct mechanisms govern the atomic dynamics: the finite,
frequency-dependent atomic response time, and momentum-space population
redistribution. At low input probe intensities, the residual Doppler width of
the atoms, combined with the finite atomic response time, result in a linear,
transient hysteretic effect that modifies the locations, widths, and magnitudes
of the resulting gain spectra depending on the sign of the scan chirp. When
larger intensities (\textit{i.e.}, greater than a few $\mu$W/cm$^2$) are
incident on the atomic sample for several $\mu$s, hole-burning in the atomic
sample's momentum distribution leads to a coherent population redistribution
that persists for approximately 100 $\mu$s. We propose using RIRs to engineer
the atomic momentum distribution to enhance the nonlinear atom-photon coupling.
We present a numerical model, and compare the calculated and experimental
results to verify our interpretation.

  Foundations of Quantum Theory and the Role Played by Gravity</title><description>  A new law of physics is proposed, defined on the cosmological scale but with
significant implications for the microscale. Motivated by nonlinear dynamical
systems theory and black-hole thermodynamics, the Invariant Set Postulate
proposes that cosmological states of physical reality belong to a
non-computable fractal state-space geometry I, invariant under the action of
some subordinate deterministic causal dynamics. An exploratory analysis is made
of a possible causal realistic framework for quantum physics, based on key
properties of I. For example, sparseness is used to relate generic
counterfactual states to points not lying on I, thus providing a geometric
basis for the essential contextuality of quantum physics and the role of the
abstract Hilbert Space in quantum theory. Also, self-similarity, described in a
symbolic setting, provides a possible &quot;realistic&quot; perspective on the essential
role of complex numbers and quaternions in quantum theory. A new interpretation
is given to the standard &quot;mysteries&quot; of quantum theory: superposition,
measurement, nonlocality, emergence of classicality and so on. It is proposed
that heterogeneities in the fractal geometry of I are manifestations of the
phenomenon of gravity. Since quantum theory is inherently blind to the
existence of such state-space geometries, the analysis here suggests that
attempts to formulate unified theories of physics within a conventional
quantum-theoretic framework are misguided, and that a successful quantum theory
of gravity should unify the causal non-Euclidean geometry of space time with
the atemporal fractal geometry of state space.

of approximate coherent states loaded into a lattice are a particularly
sensitive probe of these higher-body interactions; the visibility of
interference fringes depend on both two-, three-, and higher-body energy
scales, and these produce an initial dephasing that can help explain the
surprisingly rapid decay of revivals seen in experiments. If inhomogeneities in

the quantum Ising chain interacting with a static spin environment. Both
decoherence from the environment and non-adiabaticity of the evolution near a
critical point excite the system from the final ferromagnetic ground state. For
weak decoherence and relatively fast quenches the excitation energy,
proportional to the number of kinks in the final state, decays like an inverse
square root of a quench time, but slow transitions or strong decoherence make
it decay in a much slower logarithmic way. We also find that fidelity between
the final ferromagnetic ground state and a final state after a quench decays
exponentially with a size of a chain, with a decay rate proportional to average
density of excited kinks, and a proportionality factor evolving from 1.3 for
weak decoherence and fast quenches to approximately 1 for slow transitions or
strong decoherence. Simultaneously, correlations between kinks randomly
distributed along the chain evolve from a near-crystalline anti-bunching to a
Poissonian distribution of kinks in a number of isolated Anderson localization
centers randomly scattered along the chain.

targeted single spin operations and entangling operations can be performed by

from the Casimir pressure F_C at zero slab-mirror distances to the non-retarded

In the first case the pressure is entirely due to the photonic modes
propagating through the metal whereas in the second case it is entirely due to
the (nonretarded) surface plasmon modes supported by the free-standing thin

significant violations of Bell inequalities are obtained. These violations do
not tend to zero when the number $N$ of particles increases, and can therefore

  measurements via Wigner functions</title><description>  We study the possibility of giving a classical interpretation to quantum
projective measurements for a particle described by a pure Gaussian state whose
Wigner function is non-negative. We analyze the case of a projective
measurement which gives rise to a proper Wigner function, i.e., taking on, as
its values, the eigenvalues of the projector. We find that, despite having this
property, this kind of projector produces a state whose Wigner function ceases
to be non-negative and hence precludes its interpretation as a classical
probability density. We also study the general case in which the projected
state has a non-negative Wigner function; but then we find that the Wigner
function of the projector is not a proper one. Thus, we conclude that a
non-negative Wigner function is inadequate to serve as a hidden variable model
for quantum processes in which projective measurements take place.

two-outcome local measurements on a bipartite quantum system. We prove that no
finite dimension is sufficient to generate all these sets. We approach the
problem in two different ways by constructing explicit examples for every
dimension d, which demonstrates that there exist bipartite correlations that
necessitate d-dimensional local quantum systems in order to generate them. We

reduce the problem of approximating for the ground state of a spin chain to an
analytical minimization. This allows to show that results of standard
simulations, e.g. density matrix renormalization group and infinite time
evolving block decimation, do correspond to the result obtained by this
minimization strategy and, thus, both methods deliver optimal MPS with the same

of minimum energy and present explicit constructions for each case.
Furthermore, we analyze symmetry restoration and quantify it to uncover new
scaling relations. The method we propose can be extended to any translational

the trigger of a sudden, global perturbation (quench) represents a daunting
challenge, especially in the presence of interactions. The main difficulties
stem from both the vanishing time scale of the quench event, which can thus
create arbitrarily high energy modes, and its non-local nature, which curtails
the utility of local excitation bases. We here show that nonperturbative
methods based on integrability can prove sufficiently powerful to completely
characterize quantum quenches: we illustrate this using a model of fermions
with pairing interactions (Richardson's model). The effects of simple (and
multiple) quenches on the dynamics of various important observables are
discussed. Many of the features we find are expected to be universal to all

mathematical structure of a category with the relation $R_{ij}$ among two

introduce a realization of the corresponding categorical algebra of

indicating category theory as the foundation of Quantum Mechanics. The same
relational algebra generates a number of group structures, among them
$W_{\infty}$. The group $W_{\infty}$ is embodied and realized by the matrix

states is the well-known {\it Helstrom limit} presented in 1976. Since then, it
has been thought of as an intractable problem to obtain the minimum-error
probability for ambiguously discriminating arbitrary $m$ quantum states. In
this paper, we obtain a new lower bound on the minimum-error probability for
ambiguous discrimination and compare this bound with six other bounds in the
literature. Moreover, we show that the bound between ambiguous and unambiguous
discrimination does not extend to ensembles of more than two states.
Specifically, the main technical contributions are described as follows: (1) We
derive a new lower bound on the minimum-error probability for ambiguous
discrimination among arbitrary $m$ mixed quantum states with given prior
probabilities, and we present a necessary and sufficient condition to show that
this lower bound is attainable. (2) We compare this new lower bound with six
other bounds in the literature in detail, and, in some cases, this bound is
optimal. (3) It is known that if $m=2$, the optimal inconclusive probability of
unambiguous discrimination $Q_{U}$ and the minimum-error probability of
ambiguous discrimination $Q_{E}$ between arbitrary given $m$ mixed quantum
states have the relationship $Q_{U}\geq 2Q_{E}$. In this paper, we show that,
however, if $m&gt;2$, the relationship $Q_{U}\geq 2Q_{E}$ may not hold again in
general, and there may be no supremum of $Q_{U}/Q_{E}$ for more than two

  devices</title><description>  Any characterization of a single-photon source is not complete without
specifying its second-order degree of coherence, i.e., its $g^{(2)}$ function.
An accurate measurement of such coherence functions commonly requires
high-precision single-photon detectors, in whose absence, only time-averaged
measurements are possible. It is not clear, however, how the resulting
time-averaged quantities can be used to properly characterize the source. In
this paper, we investigate this issue for a heralded source of single photons
that relies on continuous-wave parametric down-conversion. By accounting for
major shortcomings of the source and the detectors--i.e., the multiple-photon
emissions of the source, the time resolution of photodetectors, and our chosen
width of coincidence window--our theory enables us to infer the true source
properties from imperfect measurements. Our theoretical results are
corroborated by an experimental demonstration using a PPKTP crystal pumped by a
blue laser, that results in a single-photon generation rate about 1.2 millions
per second per milliwatt of pump power. This work takes an important step
toward the standardization of such heralded single-photon sources.

110501 (2008)], the partition function of the 2D square lattice Ising model in
the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field, can specialize to the
partition function of any Ising system on an arbitrary graph. In this sense the
2D Ising model is said to be &quot;complete&quot;. However, in order to obtain the above
result, the coupling strengths on the 2D lattice must assume complex values,
and thus do not allow for a physical interpretation. Here we show how a
complete model with real -and, hence, &quot;physical&quot;- couplings can be obtained if
the 3D Ising model is considered. We furthermore show how to map general
q-state systems with possibly many-body interactions to the 2D Ising model with
complex parameters, and give completeness results for these models with real
parameters. We also demonstrate that the computational overhead in these
constructions is in all relevant cases polynomial. These results are proved by
invoking a recently found cross-connection between statistical mechanics and
quantum information theory, where partition functions are expressed as quantum
mechanical amplitudes. Within this framework, there exists a natural
correspondence between many-body quantum states that allow universal quantum
computation via local measurements only, and complete classical spin systems.

considerable progress, it remains an open problem. Motivated by this issue, we
address the more general question of equilibration. We prove, with virtually
full generality, that reaching equilibrium is a universal property of quantum
systems: Almost any subsystem in interaction with a large enough bath will
reach an equilibrium state and remain close to it for almost all times. We also
prove several general results about other aspects of thermalisation besides

clarify the role of risk and uncertainty in decision making and in particular
in relation to the phenomenon of dynamic inconsistency. By formulating this
notion in precise mathematical terms, we distinguish three types of
inconsistency: time inconsistency, planning paradox, and inconsistency
occurring in some discounting effects. While time inconsistency is well
accounted for in classical decision theory, the planning paradox is in
contradiction with classical utility theory. It finds a natural explanation in
the frame of the Quantum Decision Theory. Different types of discounting
effects are analyzed and shown to enjoy a straightforward explanation within
the suggested theory. We also introduce a general methodology based on
self-similar approximation theory for deriving the evolution equations for the
probabilities of future prospects. This provides a novel classification of
possible discount factors, which include the previously known cases
(exponential or hyperbolic discounting), but also predicts a novel class of
discount factors that decay to a strictly positive constant for very large
future time horizons. This class may be useful to deal with very long-term
discounting situations associated with intergenerational public policy choices,

continuous trajectories of particles from the source to the detector. This idea
seems to result as an unavoidable conclusion from some simple experiments. In
its original form, Hardy's thought-experiment was proposed for two independent
particles, a positron and an electron. The two either meet and annihilate, or
don't meet but become entangled. An important feature of entanglements with
particles that never meet is the difficulty they raise in front of the
assumption of &quot;hidden communication&quot; between the particles. Indeed, if the
particles don't meet, they can't have information of one another and it is
difficult to explain how can they communicate. In order to implement Hardy's
paradox with particles that never meet, the present article proposes to use
photons from three different lasers, one laser emitting UV rays, and the other
two emitting at the wavelength of the signal photon, respectively the idler
photon obtained from the down-conversion of the UV rays. The role of the
annihilation in Hardy's experiment will be played by the destructive
interference between a down-conversion pair and two photons from the low-energy
lasers.

classical logic is a logic. Soundness and completeness of both quantum and
classical logics have been proved for novel lattice models that are not
orthomodular and therefore cannot be distributive either - as opposed to the
standard lattice models that are orthomodular and distributive for the
respective logics. Hence, we cannot attribute the orthomodularity to quantum
logic itself, and we cannot attribute the distributivity to classical logic
itself. The valuations of logics with respect of novel models turn out to be
non-numerical, and therefore truth values and truth tables cannot in general be
ascribed to the propositions of logics themselves but only to the variables of
some of their models -for example, the two-valued Boolean algebra. Logics are,
first of all, axiomatic deductive systems, and if we stop short of considering
their semantics (models, valuations, etc.), then both quantum and classical
logics will have a completely equal footing in the sense of being two deductive
systems that differ from each other in a few axioms and nothing else. There is
no ground for considering either of the two logics more &quot;proper&quot; than the
other. Semantics of these logics belong to their models, and we show that there
are bigger differences between the two aforementioned classical models than
between two corresponding quantum and classical models.

those classes of the former lattices from which the standard orthomodular

The upper reservoir contains initially $n_h\le N$ weight-1 balls and the lower

system to a heat engine. This thermal interpretation is applicable only when
the number of balls is large. We define the entropy as the logarithm of the

Gaussian, any good measure of non-Gaussianity should be invariant under
transformations which do not alter the shape of the $Q$ functions, namely
displacements, passage through passive linear systems, and uniform scaling of
all the phase space variables: $Q(\alpha)\to \lambda^{2n}Q(\lambda \alpha)$.
Our measure which meets this `shape criterion' is computed for a few families
of states, and the results are contrasted with existing measures of
non-Gaussianity. The shape criterion implies, in particular, that the
non-Gaussianity of the photon-added thermal states should be independent of
temperature.

  1550 nm with an Active Quenching ASIC</title><description>  We present an active quenching application specific integrated circuit
(ASIC), for use in conjunction with InGaAs/InP avalanche photodiodes (APDs),
for 1550 nm single-photon detection. To evaluate its performance, we first
compare its operation with that of standard quenching electronics. We then test
4 InGaAs/InP APDs using the ASIC, operating both in the free-running and gated
modes, to study more general behavior. We investigate not only the standard
parameters under different working conditions but also parameters such as
charge persistence and quenching time. We also use the multiple trapping model
to account for the afterpulsing behavior in the gated mode, and further propose
a model to take account of the afterpulsing effects in the free-running mode.
Our results clearly indicate that the performance of APDs with an on-chip
quenching circuit significantly surpasses the conventional quenching
electronics, and makes them suitable for practical applications, e.g., quantum
cryptography.

operators which form a generalized model of probability, and computations are
most commonly described as products of unitary transformations, which are the
transformations which preserve the quality of the data in a precise sense. This
naturally leads to &quot;unitary circuit models&quot;, which are models of computation in
which unitary operators are expressed as a product of &quot;elementary&quot; unitary
transformations. However, unitary transformations can also be effected as a
composition of operations which are not all unitary themselves: the &quot;one-way
measurement model&quot; is one such model of quantum computation.
  In this thesis, we examine the relationship between representations of
unitary operators and decompositions of those operators in the one-way
measurement model. In particular, we consider different circumstances under
which a procedure in the one-way measurement model can be described as
simulating a unitary circuit, by considering the combinatorial structures which
are common to unitary circuits and two simple constructions of one-way based
procedures. These structures lead to a characterization of the one-way
measurement patterns which arise from these constructions, which can then be
related to efficiently testable properties of graphs. We also consider how
these characterizations provide automatic techniques for obtaining complete
measurement-based decompositions, from unitary transformations which are
specified by operator expressions bearing a formal resemblance to path
integrals. These techniques are presented as a possible means to devise new
algorithms in the one-way measurement model, independently of algorithms in the
unitary circuit model.

  critical points</title><description>  Studies of entanglement in many-particle systems suggest that most quantum
critical ground states have infinitely more entanglement than non-critical
states. Standard algorithms for one-dimensional many-particle systems construct
model states with limited entanglement, which are a worse approximation to
quantum critical states than to others. We give a quantitative theory of
previously observed scaling behavior resulting from finite entanglement at
quantum criticality: the scaling theory of finite entanglement is only
superficially similar to finite-size scaling, and has a different physical
origin. We find that finite-entanglement scaling is governed not by the scaling
dimension of an operator but by the &quot;central charge&quot; of the critical point,
which counts its universal degrees of freedom. An important ingredient is the
recently obtained universal distribution of density-matrix eigenvalues at a
critical point\cite{calabrese1}. The parameter-free theory is checked against
numerical scaling at several quantum critical points.

spectrum-generating algebra is developed. The algorithm is based on the idea of
dynamical coarse-graining. The original unitary dynamics of the target
observables, the elements of the spectrum-generating algebra, is simulated by a
surrogate open-system dynamics, which can be interpreted as weak measurement of
the target observables, performed on the evolving system. The open-system state

The localization reduces the scaling of the computational resources with the
Hilbert space dimension n by factor n^{3/2}/ln n compared to conventional
sparse-matrix methods. The guidelines for the choice of parameters for the
simulation are presented and the scaling of the computational resources with
the Hilbert space dimension of the system is estimated. The algorithm is

that the situation is different in the quantum case, where the same
transformation can make the communication complexity exponentially larger. This
happens if and only if the original problem has exponential gap between quantum
and classical one-way communication costs. We believe that these auxiliary
results might be of independent interest.

quantum mechanical model from the spatial freezing of a well known relativistic
field theory - the chiral Schwinger model. We apply the Hamiltonian constraint
analysis of Dirac [1] and find that the nature of constraints depends
critically on a $c$-number parameter present in the model. Thus a change in the
parameter alters the number of dynamical modes in an abrupt and
non-perturbative way.
  We have obtained new {\it{real}} energy levels for the quantum mechanical
model as we explore {\it{complex}} domains in the parameter space. These were
forbidden in the parent chiral Schwinger field theory where the analogue
Jackiw-Rajaraman parameter is restricted to be real. We explicitly show
existence of modes that satisfy higher derivative Pais-Uhlenbeck form of
dynamics [3].
  We also show that the Cranking Model [7], well known in Nuclear Physics, can
be interpreted as a spatially frozen version of another well studied
relativistic field theory in 2+1-dimension- the Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Proca
Model [8].

involves a V-type atom subjected to a strong drive laser, a weak probe laser

find that the simultaneous coupling of the cavity field to both atomic

quantum interference effects. We investigate the influences of the cavity field
frequency, the cavity field-atom coupling constants and the atomic decay

We predict giant Kerr nonlinearities with vanishing absorption and attribute

two consequences. First, the maximal amount by which the CHSH inequality is
violated decays to zero. Second, the set of directions of measurement for which
the inequality is violated is reduced in the course of decoherence. The volume
of that set is bounded above by C|r|^2, where r is the decoherence factor. We

occurring randomly with a given probability. Quantum ensembles are necessary to
describe situations with incomplete a priori information, such as the output of
a stochastic quantum channel (generalized measurement), and play a central role
in quantum communication. In this paper, we propose measures of distance and
fidelity between two quantum ensembles. We consider two approaches: the first
one is based on the ability to mimic one ensemble given the other one as a
resource and is closely related to the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transportation
problem, while the second one uses the idea of extended-Hilbert-space (EHS)
representations which introduce auxiliary pointer (or flag) states. Both types
of measures enjoy a number of desirable properties. The Kantorovich measures,
albeit monotonic under deterministic quantum operations, are not monotonic
under generalized measurements. In contrast, the EHS measures are. We present
operational interpretations for both types of measures. We also show that the
EHS fidelity between ensembles provides a novel interpretation of the fidelity
between mixed states--the latter is equal to the maximum of the fidelity
between all pure-state ensembles whose averages are equal to the mixed states
being compared. We finally use the new measures to define distance and fidelity
for stochastic quantum channels and positive operator-valued measures (POVMs).
These quantities may be useful in the context of tomography of stochastic
quantum channels and quantum detectors.

Onicescu and Tsallis entropies in atoms, as well as SDL and LMC complexity
measures, as functions of the atomic number Z. Fractional occupation
probabilities of electrons in atomic orbitals are employed, instead of the more
complicated continuous electron probability densities in position and momentum
spaces, used so far in the literature. Our main conclusions are compatible with
the results of more sophisticated approaches and correlate fairly with
experimental data. We obtain for the Tsallis entropic index the value q=1.031,
which shows that atoms are very close to extensivity. A practical way towards
scalability of the quantification of complexity for systems with more
components than the atom is indicated. We also discuss the issue if the
complexity of the electronic structure of atoms increases with Z. A Pair of
Order-Disorder Indices (PODI), which can be introduced for any quantum
many-body system, is evaluated in atoms. We conclude that &quot;atoms are ordered

  measures close to quantum critical points</title><description>  We consider a two-chain, spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ladder in
an external magnetic field H. The spin ladder is known to undergo second order
quantum phase transitions (QPTs) at two critical values, Hc1 and Hc2, of the
magnetic field. There are now known examples of strongly coupled (rung exchange
interaction much stronger than nearest-neighbour intrachain exchange
interaction) organic ladder compounds in which QPTs have been experimentally
observed. In this paper, we investigate whether well-known bipartite
entanglement meaures like one-site von Neumann entropy, two-site von Neumann
entropy and concurrence develop special features close to the quantum critical
points. As suggested by an earlier theorem, the first derivatives of the
measures with respect to magnetic field are expected to diverge as H tends to
Hc1 and Hc2. Based on numerical diagonalization data and a mapping of the
strongly-coupled ladder Hamiltonian onto the XXZ chain Hamiltonian, for which
several analytical results are known, we find that the derivatives of the
entanglement measures diverge as H tends to Hc2 but remain finite as H tend to
Hc1. The reason for this discrepancy is analysed. We further calculate two
recently proposed quantum information theoretic measures, the reduced fidelity
and reduced fidelity susceptibility, and show that these measures provide
appropriate signatures of the QPTs occuring at the critical points H=Hc1 and
H=Hc2.

the secret state is chosen from a special ensemble and known to the sender

by performing only a single-qubit measurement and broadcasting an one-cbit

with simpler measurement and less classical communication. In comparison,
existing schemes work for arbitrary quantum states which need not be known to
Alice, however she is required to perform a two-qubit Bell measurement and
communicate a two-cbit message. Hence there is a trade off between flexibility
and measurement complexity plus classical resource. In situations where our
schemes are applicable, they will greatly reduce the measurement complexity and
at the same time cut the communication overhead by one half.

quantum system is usually modelled using a Hilbert space of tensor product
form, each factor associated to one observer. Correspondingly, the operators
describing the observables are then acting non-trivially only on one of the
tensor factors. However, the same situation can also be modelled by just using
one joint Hilbert space, and requiring that all operators associated to
different observers commute, i.e. are jointly measurable without causing
disturbance. The problem of Tsirelson is now to decide the question whether all
quantum correlation functions between two independent observers derived from
commuting observables can also be expressed using observables defined on a
Hilbert space of tensor product form. Tsirelson showed already that the
distinction is irrelevant in the case that the ambient Hilbert space is of
finite dimension. We show here that the problem is equivalent to the question
whether all quantum correlation functions can be approximated by correlation
function derived from finite-dimensional systems. We also discuss some physical

that there is no need to increase the frame size of the code when extra shared

  Theory Perspective</title><description>  We consider the entanglement dynamics between two Unruh-DeWitt detectors at
rest separated at a distance $d$. This simple model when analyzed properly in
quantum field theory shows many interesting facets and helps to dispel some
misunderstandings of entanglement dynamics. We find that there is spatial
dependence of quantum entanglement in the stable regime due to the phase
difference of vacuum fluctuations the two detectors experience, together with
the interference of the mutual influences from the backreaction of one detector
on the other. When two initially entangled detectors are still outside each
other's light cone, the entanglement oscillates in time with an amplitude
dependent on spatial separation $d$. When the two detectors begin to have
causal contact, an interference pattern of the relative degree of entanglement
(compared to those at spatial infinity) develops a parametric dependence on
$d$. The detectors separated at those $d$ with a stronger relative degree of
entanglement enjoy longer disentanglement times. In the cases with weak
coupling and large separation, the detectors always disentangle at late times.
For sufficiently small $d$, the two detectors can have residual entanglement
even if they initially were in a separable state, while for $d$ a little
larger, there could be transient entanglement created by mutual influences.
However, we see no evidence of entanglement creation outside the light cone for
initially separable states.

group method for a non-uniform Hamiltonian, which has deformed interaction
strength of $j$-th bond proportional to $\cosh \lambda j$, the uniform
Hamiltonian is analyzed as a limit of $\lambda \to 0$. As a consequence of the
deformation, an excited quasi-particle is weakly bounded around the center of
the system, and kept away from the system boundary. Therefore, insensitivity of
an estimated excitation gap of the deformed system to the boundary allows us to
have the bulk excitation gap $\Delta(\lambda)$, and shift in $\Delta(\lambda)$
from $\Delta(0)$ is nearly linear in $\lambda$ when $\lambda \ll 1$. Efficiency
of this estimation is demonstrated through application to the S=1

reconstructs itself at regular intervals, is a diffraction phenomenon that
occurs in many physical systems. Here we present the first observation of the
Talbot effect for electron de Broglie waves behind a nanofabricated
transmission grating. This was thought to be difficult because of Coulomb
interactions between electrons and nanostructure gratings, yet we were able to
map out the entire near-field interference pattern, the &quot;Talbot carpet&quot;, behind
a grating. We did this using a Talbot interferometer, in which Talbot
interference fringes from one grating are moire'-filtered by a 2nd grating.
This arrangement has served for optical, X-ray, and atom interferometry, but
never before for electrons. Talbot interferometers are particularly sensitive
to distortions of the incident wavefronts, and to illustrate this we used our
Talbot interferometer to measure the wavefront curvature of a weakly focused
electron beam. Here we report how this wavefront curvature demagnified the
Talbot revivals, and we discuss applications for electron Talbot
interferometers.

fields, a network of beam splitters and measurements. It is based on nothing
else than the dispersive interaction between the atomic ensembles and the

experimental constraints and formulate the solution in terms of a convex
optimization. Specifically, we outline an efficient method to identify the
optimal strategy for estimating multiple unknown parameters of a quantum
process and apply this method to a realistic example. The example is two
electron spin qubits coupled through the dipole and exchange interactions with
unknown coupling parameters -- explicitly, the position vector relating the two
qubits and the magnitude of the exchange interaction are unknown. This coupling
Hamiltonian generates a unitary evolution which, when combined with arbitrary
single-qubit operations, produces a universal set of quantum gates. However,
the unknown parameters must be known precisely to generate high-fidelity gates.
We use the Cram\'er-Rao bound on the variance of a point estimator to construct
the optimal series of experiments to estimate these free parameters, and
present a complete analysis of the optimal experimental configuration. Our
method of transforming the constrained optimal parameter estimation problem
into a convex optimization is powerful and widely applicable to other systems.

open-quantum-system dynamics, quantum measurements, and quantum error
correction (QEC). The first topic concerns weak measurements and their
universality as a means of generating quantum operations. It is shown that
every generalized measurement can be implemented as a sequence of weak
(infinitesimal) measurements. The second topic is an application of this result
to the theory of entanglement. Necessary and sufficient differential conditions
for entanglement monotones are derived and are used to find a new entanglement
monotone for three-qubit states. The third topic is a study of the performance
of different master equations for the description of non-Markovian dynamics.
The system studied is a qubit coupled to a spin bath via the Ising interaction.
The fourth topic investigates continuous QEC in the presence of non-Markovian
noise. It is shown that due to the existence of a Zeno regime in non-Markovian
dynamics, the performance of continuous QEC exhibits a quadratic improvement
for a sufficiently high time resolution of the error-correcting operations. The
fifth topic studies the conditions for correctability of subsystem codes under
continuous dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions on the Lindbladian and
the system-environment Hamiltonian are derived. The sixth topic examines the
robustness of operator QEC codes against initialization errors. A new measure
of fidelity for encoded information is introduced and is used to show that
operator codes are robust against imperfect initialization without the need for
restriction of the standard operator QEC conditions. The last topic concerns
holonomic quantum computation (HQC) and stabilizer codes. A fault-tolerant
scheme for HQC is presented, proving the scalability of the holonomic approach.

the receiver only possesses a bounded-size quantum token of the sender's
reference frame, then the decoding is imperfect, and we can describe this
effect as a noisy quantum channel. We seek here to characterize the performance
of such schemes, or equivalently, to determine the effective decoherence
induced by having a bounded-size reference frame. We assume that the token is
prepared in a special state that has particularly nice group-theoretic
properties and that is near-optimal for transmitting information about the
sender's frame. We present a decoding operation, which can be proven to be
near-optimal in this case, and we demonstrate that there are two distinct ways
of implementing it (corresponding to two distinct Kraus decompositions). In
one, the receiver measures the orientation of the reference frame token and
reorients the system appropriately. In the other, the receiver extracts the
encoded information from the virtual subsystems that describe the relational
degrees of freedom of the system and token. Finally, we provide explicit
characterizations of these decoding schemes when the system is a single qubit

finite-duration, square $\pi$ pulses, yielding strong agreement between
experimental data and theory for arbitrary pulse sequences. These results
demonstrate the robustness of qubit memory error suppression through dynamical
decoupling techniques across a variety of qubit technologies.

  Applications</title><description>  It is conjectured that quantum computers are able to solve certain problems
more quickly than any deterministic or probabilistic computer. A quantum
computer exploits the rules of quantum mechanics to speed up computations.
However, it is a formidable task to build a quantum computer, since the quantum
mechanical systems storing the information unavoidably interact with their
environment. Therefore, one has to mitigate the resulting noise and decoherence
effects to avoid computational errors.
  In this work, I study various aspects of quantum error control codes -- the
key component of fault-tolerant quantum information processing. I present the
fundamental theory and necessary background of quantum codes and construct many
families of quantum block and convolutional codes over finite fields, in
addition to families of subsystem codes over symmetric and asymmetric channels.
  Particularly, many families of quantum BCH, RS, duadic, and convolutional
codes are constructed over finite fields. Families of subsystem codes and a
class of optimal MDS subsystem codes are derived over asymmetric and symmetric
quantum channels. In addition, propagation rules and tables of upper bounds on
subsystem code parameters are established. Classes of quantum and classical
LDPC codes based on finite geometries and Latin squares are constructed.

systems implemented with weak coherent pulses, allowing significantly better
secret bit rates and longer maximum distances. In this paper we present a
method to numerically find optimal three-level protocols, and we examine how
the secret bit rate and the optimized parameters are dependent on various
system properties, such as session length, transmission loss, and visibility.
Additionally, we show how to modify the decoy state analysis to handle
partially distinguishable decoy states as well as uncertainty in the prepared
intensities.

models is presented. This work is relevant to assess the usefulness of these
systems as a quantum memory. For our purposes, we use the topological mutual
information $I_{\mathrm{topo}}$ as a &quot;topological order parameter&quot;. For Abelian
models, we show how $I_{\mathrm{topo}}$ depends on the thermal topological
charge probability distribution. More generally, we present a conjecture that
$I_{\mathrm{topo}}$ can (asymptotically) be written as a Kullback-Leitner
distance between this probability distribution and that induced by the quantum
dimensions of the model at hand. We also explain why $I_{\mathrm{topo}}$ is
more suitable for our purposes than the more familiar entanglement entropy
$S_{\mathrm{topo}}$. A scaling law, encoding the interplay of volume and
temperature effects, as well as different limit procedures, are derived in
detail. A non-Abelian model is next analysed and similar results are found.
Finally, we also consider, in the case of a one-plaquette toric code, an
environment model giving rise to a simulation of thermal effects in time.

  temperature</title><description>  We discuss the existence of stable topological quantum memory at finite
temperature. At stake here is the fundamental question of whether it is, in
principle, possible to store quantum information for macroscopic times without
the intervention from the external world, that is, without error correction. We
study the toric code in two dimensions with an additional bosonic field that
couples to the defects, in the presence of a generic environment at finite
temperature: the toric-boson model. Although the coupling constants for the
bare model are not finite in the thermodynamic limit, the model has a finite
spectrum. We show that in the topological phase, there is a finite temperature
below which open strings are confined and therefore the lifetime of the memory
can be made arbitrarily (polynomially) long in system size. The interaction
with the bosonic field yields a long-range attractive force between the end
points of open strings but leaves closed strings and topological order intact.

  Resonating-Valence-Bond States&quot;</title><description>  In Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 170502 (2007) (arXiv:quant-ph/0703227), we prove that
resonating-valence-bond (RVB) states on arbitrary lattices possess genuine
multiparty entanglement, and provide bounds on two-particle entanglement (and
correlators). We also conjecture on the entanglement in large and small
portions of the whole lattice. The proof, bound, and conjecture are not
considered in the Comment in Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 248901 (2008)
(arXiv:0812.1932v1 [quant-ph]).
  Next we take two examples: &quot;RVB gas&quot; and &quot;RVB liquid&quot;. RVB liquid for
arbitrary lattice size is not considered in the Comment. Two-party entanglement
of RVB gas for relatively large lattice size is derived by an independent
method in the Comment, and it agrees with our result. Multi-party entanglement
of RVB gas is not considered in the Comment.
  Lastly, we consider an RVB liquid on a 4x4 square lattice and there was an
error in the calculation of two-party entanglement in the second decimal place,
as noted in the Comment. Note that this calculation was nowhere used in our
Letter to derive other results. Moreover, the conclusion of &quot;no two-particle
entanglement&quot; is still true for the RVB liquid on a 4x4 square lattice.

principles: (1) Gauge decomposition; (2) Maximum entropy. To wit: (1) The
reduction decomposition of a state vector is the Schmidt decomposition with
respect to the states of a set of (dressed) gauge boson modes; (2) The
reduction instant is that of the maximum entropy of a resulting mixed state.
The theory determines states undergoing the reduction, its instant, resulting
pure states and their probabilities. Applications: (Polarized) photon
absorption and transmission, emission, particle detection, reduction of a
superposition of states, nonintegral photon states, photon and matter-photon
entanglement, processes with weak bosons, and the role of gluons.

  models</title><description>  Based on the obtained exact results we systematically study the quench
dynamics of a one-dimensional spin-1/2 transverse field Ising model with zero-
and finite-temperature initial states. We focus on the magnetization of the
system after a sudden change of the external field and a coherent
time-evolution process. With a zero-temperature initial state, the quench
magnetic susceptibility as a function of the initial field strength exhibits
strongly similar scaling behaviors to those of the static magnetic
susceptibility, and the quench magnetic susceptibility as a function of the
final field strength shows a discontinuity at the quantum critical point. This
discontinuity remains robust and always occurs at the quantum critical point
even for the case of finite-temperature initial systems, which indicates a
great advantage of employing quench dynamics to study quantum phase
transitions.

arising in many fields, from the social and physical sciences to economics.
Recently, as the definition of information is generalized to include entangled
quantum systems, quantum game theory has emerged as a framework for
understanding the competitive flow of quantum information. Up till now only
two-player quantum games have been demonstrated. Here we report the first
experiment that implements a four-player quantum Minority game over tunable
four-partite entangled states encoded in the polarization of single photons.
Experimental application of appropriate quantum player strategies give
equilibrium payoff values well above those achievable in the classical game.
These results are in excellent quantitative agreement with our theoretical
analysis of the symmetric Pareto optimal strategies. Our result demonstrate for
the first time how non-trivial equilibria can arise in a competitive situation
involving quantum agents and pave the way for a range of quantum transaction
applications.

The atom ensemble splits the linearly polarized light ray into two

splitting, the atom ensemble behaves as a birefringent lens, which allows one
polarized light ray passing through straightly while focus another orthogonal
