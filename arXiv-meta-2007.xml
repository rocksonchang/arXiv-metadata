shown to admit a clear geometrical interpretation, when applied to
Schmidt-correlated (SC) states: the negativity of a SC state equals a distance
of the state from a pertinent separable state. As a consequence, a SC state is
separable if and only if its negativity vanishes. Another remarkable
consequence is that the negativity of a SC can be estimated &quot;at a glance&quot; on
the density matrix. These results are generalized to mixtures of SC states,
which emerge in certain quantum-dynamical settings.

resonance with the oscillator the latter can be driven far from equilibrium.
Blue detuned driving leads to a population inversion in the qubit and a
bi-stability with lasing behavior of the oscillator; for red detuning the qubit
cools the oscillator. This behavior persists at the symmetry point where the

realism by separable states&quot;, in the sense that multi-partite separable quantum
states are supposed to give rise to correlations and fluctuations that violate
a Bell-type inequality that Chen takes to be satisfied by local realism.
However, this can not be true since all predictions (including all correlations
and fluctuations) that separable quantum states give rise to have a local
realistic description and thus satisfy all Bell-type inequalities, and this
holds for all number of parties. Since Chen claims otherwise by presenting a
new inequality, claimed to be a Bell-type one, which separable states
supposedly can violate, there must be a flaw in the argumentation. I will
expose this flaw, not merely for clarification of this issue, but perhaps even
more importantly since it re-teaches us an old lesson John Bell taught us over
40 years ago. I will argue that this lesson provides us with a new morale
especially relevant to modern research in Bell-type inequalities.

an almost-perfect cluster state can be produced. We also propose a possible

vapor spectroscopy. For two-photon transitions one would naively expect the
Doppler effect to cause a residual broadening, proportional to the wave-vector
difference. In coherent population trapping (CPT), which is a narrow-band
phenomenon, such broadening was not observed experimentally. This has been
commonly attributed to frequent velocity-changing collisions, known to narrow
Doppler-broadened one-photon absorption lines (Dicke narrowing). Here we show
theoretically that such a narrowing mechanism indeed exists for CPT resonances.
The narrowing factor is the ratio between the atom's mean free path and the
wavelength associated with the wave-vector difference of the two radiation
fields. A possible experiment to verify the theory is suggested.

Besides applications similar to those of optical metamaterials, a nanosized

  nondemolition measurement</title><description>  We study how the spontaneous relaxation of a qubit affects a continuous
quantum non-demolition measurement of the initial state of the qubit. Given
some noisy measurement record $\Psi$, we seek an estimate of whether the qubit
was initially in the ground or excited state. We investigate four different
measurement protocols, three of which use a linear filter (with different
weighting factors) and a fourth which uses a full non-linear filter that gives
the theoretically optimal estimate of the initial state of the qubit. We find
that relaxation of the qubit at rate $1/T_1$ strongly influences the fidelity
of any measurement protocol. To avoid errors due to this decay, the measurement
must be completed in a time that decrease linearly with the desired fidelity
while maintaining an adequate signal to noise ratio. We find that for the
non-linear filter the predicted fidelity, as expected, is always better than
the linear filters and that the fidelity is a monotone increasing function of
the measurement time. For example, to achieve a fidelity of 90%, the box car
linear filter requires a signal to noise ratio of $\sim 30$ in a time $T_1$
whereas the non-linear filter only requires a signal to noise ratio of $\sim
18$.

advantage of undergoing negligible decoherence. However, the absence of any
significant photon-photon interaction is problematic for the realization of
non-trivial two-qubit gates. One solution is to introduce an effective
nonlinearity by measurements resulting in probabilistic gate operations. In
one-way quantum computation, the random quantum measurement error can be
overcome by applying a feed-forward technique, such that the future measurement
basis depends on earlier measurement results. This technique is crucial for
achieving deterministic quantum computation once a cluster state (the highly
entangled multiparticle state on which one-way quantum computation is based) is
prepared. Here we realize a concatenated scheme of measurement and active
feed-forward in a one-way quantum computing experiment. We demonstrate that,
for a perfect cluster state and no photon loss, our quantum computation scheme
would operate with good fidelity and that our feed-forward components function
with very high speed and low error for detected photons. With present
technology, the individual computational step (in our case the individual
feed-forward cycle) can be operated in less than 150 ns using electro-optical
modulators. This is an important result for the future development of one-way
quantum computers, whose large-scale implementation will depend on advances in
the production and detection of the required highly entangled cluster states.

  causal structure</title><description>  A quantum gravity computer is one for which the particular effects of quantum
gravity are relevant. In general relativity, causal structure is non-fixed. In
quantum theory non-fixed quantities are subject to quantum uncertainty. It is
therefore likely that, in a theory of quantum gravity, we will have indefinite
causal structure. This means that there will be no matter of fact as to whether
a particular interval is timelike or not. We study the implications of this for
the theory of computation. Classical and quantum computations consist in
ivolving the state of the computer through a sequence of time steps. This will,
most likely, not be possible for a quantum gravity computer because the notion
of a time step makes no sense if we have indefinite causal structure. We show
that it is possible to set up a model for computation even in the absence of
definite causal structure by using a certain framework (the causaloid
formalism) that was developed for the purpose of correlating data taken in this
type of situation. Corresponding to a physical theory is a causaloid, Lambda
(this is a mathematical object containing information about the causal
connections between different spacetime regions). A computer is given by the
pair {Lambda, S} where S is a set of gates. Working within the causaloid
formalism, we explore the question of whether universal quantum gravity
computers are possible. We also examine whether a quantum gravity computer
might be more powerful than a quantum (or classical) computer. In particular,
we ask whether indefinite causal structure can be used as a computational
resource.

nondissipative optical lattice is developed. Using the basic equations of
motion for the Bloch and translational atomic variables, we derive a stochastic
map for the synchronized component of the atomic dipole moment that determines
the center-of-mass motion. We find the analytical relations between the atomic
and lattice parameters under which atoms typically alternate between flying
through the lattice and being trapped in the wells of the optical potential. We
use the stochastic map to derive formulas for the probability density functions
(PDFs) for the flight and trapping events. Statistical properties of chaotic
atomic transport strongly depend on the relations between the atomic and
lattice parameters. We show that there is a good quantitative agreement between
the analytical PDFs and those computed with the stochastic map and the basic
equations of motion for different ranges of the parameters. Typical flight and
trapping PDFs are shown to be broad distributions with power law ``heads'' with
the slope -1.5 and exponential ``tails''. The lengths of the power law and
exponential parts of the PDFs depend on the values of the parameters and can be
varied continuously. We find analytical conditions, under which deterministic
atomic transport has fractal properties, and explain a hierarchical structure
of the dynamical fractals.

providing which-way information. A thin wire is then placed at a minimum of the

multipartite quantum states, which are normalized graph Laplacians, first given
by Braunstein {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{73}, 012320 (2006)]. The
conjecture states that a multipartite quantum state is separable if and only if
the degree matrix of the graph associated with the state is equal to the degree
matrix of the partial transpose of this graph. We call this statement to be the
strong form of the conjecture. In its weak version, the conjecture requires
only the necessity, that is, if the state is separable, the corresponding
degree matrices match. We prove the strong form of the conjecture for {\it
pure} multipartite quantum states, using the modified tensor product of graphs
defined in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \textbf{40}, 10251 (2007)], as both
necessary and sufficient condition for separability. Based on this proof, we
give a polynomial-time algorithm for completely factorizing any pure
multipartite quantum state. By polynomial-time algorithm we mean that the
execution time of this algorithm increases as a polynomial in $m,$ where $m$ is
the number of parts of the quantum system. We give a counter-example to show
that the conjecture fails, in general, even in its weak form, for multipartite
mixed states. Finally, we prove this conjecture, in its weak form, for a class
of multipartite mixed states, giving only a necessary condition for
separability.

transfer of qubits via teleportation. We evaluate the performance of several
quantum error correction codes, and find that teleportation failure rates of
one percent or more are tolerable when two levels of the [[23,1,7]] code are

QEC-encoded states that span two quantum computers, including the creation of
distributed logical zeroes. The transfer of the individual qubits of a logical
state may be multiplexed in time or space, moving serially across a single
link, or in parallel across multiple links. We show that the performance and
reliability penalty for using serial links is small for a broad range of
physical parameters, making serial links preferable for a large, distributed
quantum multicomputer when engineering difficulties are considered. Such a
multicomputer will be able to factor a 1,024-bit number using Shor's algorithm

quantum optics. Multiphoton processes occur and are important for many aspects
of matter-radiation interactions that include the efficient ionization of atoms
and molecules, and, more generally, atomic transition mechanisms;
system-environment couplings and dissipative quantum dynamics; laser physics,
optical parametric processes, and interferometry. A single review cannot
account for all aspects of such an enormously vast subject. Here we choose to
concentrate our attention on parametric processes in nonlinear media, with
special emphasis on the engineering of nonclassical states of photons and
atoms. We present a detailed analysis of the methods and techniques for the
production of genuinely quantum multiphoton processes in nonlinear media, and
the corresponding models of multiphoton effective interactions. We review
existing proposals for the classification, engineering, and manipulation of
nonclassical states, including Fock states, macroscopic superposition states,
and multiphoton generalized coherent states. We introduce and discuss the
structure of canonical multiphoton quantum optics and the associated one- and
two-mode canonical multiphoton squeezed states. This framework provides a
consistent multiphoton generalization of two-photon quantum optics and a
consistent Hamiltonian description of multiphoton processes associated to
higher-order nonlinearities. Finally, we discuss very recent advances that by
combining linear and nonlinear optical devices allow to realize multiphoton
entangled states of the electromnagnetic field, that are relevant for
applications to efficient quantum computation, quantum teleportation, and
related problems in quantum communication and information.

decoheres and becomes a classical one is what is termed in the literature the
Zeno effect. This effect, named after the ancient Greek philosopher Zeno of
Elea (born about 485 B.C), were used in 1977 to analytically predict that an
initial quantum state may be preserved in time by merely repeating a large
number of times, in a finite total time, the experiment of checking its state.
Since then this effect has been experimentally validated and has become an
established physical fact. It has been argued by Simonius that the Zeno effect
must be related not only to quantum phenomena but also to many macroscopic and
classical effects. Thus, since it operates in both quantum and classical
regimes it must cause to a more generalized kind of decoherence than the
restricted one that ``classicalizes'' a quantum phenomenon. We show that this
generalized decoherence, {\it obtained as a result of dense measurement}, not
only gives rise to new phenomena that are demonstrated through new responses of
the densely interacted-upon system but also may physically {\it establish}
them. For that matter we have found and established the analogous {\it space
Zeno effect} which leads to the necessity of an ensemble of related observers
(systems) for the remarked physical validation of new phenomena. As will be
shown in Chapters 3-5 of this work the new phenomena (new responses of the
system) that result from the space Zeno effect may be of an unexpected nature.
We use quantum field theory in addition to the more conventional methods of
analysis and also corroborate our analytical findings by numerical simulations.

understood in terms of propagation of spin waves. This gives a simple, physical
explanation of the behaviour seen in a number of recent works, in which a
localised, low-energy excitation is created and allowed to evolve. But it also
extends to the scenario of translationally invariant systems in states far from
equilibrium, which require less local control to prepare. Spin-wave evolution
is completely determined by the system's dispersion relation, and the latter
typically depends on a small number of external, physical parameters.
Therefore, this new insight into correlation dynamics opens up the possibility
not only of predicting but also of controlling the propagation velocity and
dispersion rate, by manipulating these parameters. We demonstrate this
analytically in a simple, example system.

study systematically the statistical properties of the bipartite entanglement

We rigorously prove the &quot;concentration of measure&quot; around a finite average,
occurring for the entanglement in the thermodynamical limit in both the
canonical and the micro-canonical approach. For finite n, we determine
analytically the average and standard deviation of the entanglement (as
quantified by the reduced purity) between one mode and all the other modes.
Furthermore, we numerically investigate more general situations, clearly
showing that the onset of the concentration of measure already occurs at
relatively small n.

  Range in Quantum Control and Quantum Information</title><description>  This paper shows how C-numerical-range related new strucures may arise from
practical problems in quantum control--and vice versa, how an understanding of
these structures helps to tackle hot topics in quantum information.
  We start out with an overview on the role of C-numerical ranges in current
research problems in quantum theory: the quantum mechanical task of maximising
the projection of a point on the unitary orbit of an initial state onto a
target state C relates to the C-numerical radius of A via maximising the trace
function |\tr \{C^\dagger UAU^\dagger\}|. In quantum control of n qubits one
may be interested (i) in having U\in SU(2^n) for the entire dynamics, or (ii)
in restricting the dynamics to {\em local} operations on each qubit, i.e. to
the n-fold tensor product SU(2)\otimes SU(2)\otimes &gt;...\otimes SU(2).
Interestingly, the latter then leads to a novel entity, the {\em local}
C-numerical range W_{\rm loc}(C,A), whose intricate geometry is neither
star-shaped nor simply connected in contrast to the conventional C-numerical
range. This is shown in the accompanying paper (math-ph/0702005).
  We present novel applications of the C-numerical range in quantum control
assisted by gradient flows on the local unitary group: (1) they serve as
powerful tools for deciding whether a quantum interaction can be inverted in
time (in a sense generalising Hahn's famous spin echo); (2) they allow for
optimising witnesses of quantum entanglement. We conclude by relating the
relative C-numerical range to problems of constrained quantum optimisation, for
which we also give Lagrange-type gradient flow algorithms.

controlled rotations of the qubus and unconditional qubus displacements. The
controlled rotations are realizable through typical atom-light interactions in
quantum optics. For such interactions, our scheme is universal and works in any
regime, including the limits of weak and strong nonlinearities.

equation to obtain the Pauli equation for one particle is generalized to obtain
an $N$-particle equation with spin. This is achieved by using the more
universal matrix factorization, $G\tilde{G} = |G| I = (-K)^l I$. Here the
square matrix $G$ is linear in the total energy E and all momenta, $\tilde G$
is the matrix adjoint of $G$, $I$ is the identity matrix, $|G|$ is the
determinant of $G$, $l$ is a positive integer and $K=H-E$ is Lanczos' extended
Hamiltonian where $H$ is the classical Hamiltonian of the electro-mechanical
system. $K$ is identically zero for all such systems, so that matrix $G$ is
singular. As a consequence there always exists a vector function
$\underline\theta$ with the property $G\underline\theta=0$. This factorization
to obtain the matrix $G$ and vector function $\underline\theta$ is illustrated
first for a one-dimensional particle in a simple potential well. This same
technique, when applied to the classical nonrelativistic Hamiltonian for $N$
interacting particles in an electromagnetic field, is shown to yield for N=1
the Pauli wave equation with spin and its generalization to $N$ particles.
Finally this nonrelativistic generalization of the Pauli equation is used to
treat the simple Zeeman effect of a hydrogen-like atom as a two-particle
problem with spin.

decoherence introduced by this noise are not covered by the common error
models. Using the controlled-phase gate as an example, the effect of gate
control noise on decoherence is investigated for different quantum computer

with the length of a quantum register for most cases considered, adding to the
challenge of implementing proposed error correcting and fault tolerant

obtained by tracing out some of its subsystems approximates a convex sum of
power states. The more subsystems are traced out, the better this approximation
becomes. Schur-Weyl duality suggests that there ought to be a dual result that
applies to a unitarily invariant state rather than a symmetric state. Instead
of tracing out a number of subsystems, one traces out part of every subsystem.
The theorem then asserts that the resulting state approximates the fully mixed
state, and the larger the dimension of the traced-out part of each subsystem,
the better this approximation becomes. This paper gives a number of
propositions together with their dual versions, to show how far the duality
holds.

that allow scalable quantum computing, even when using non-deterministic
quantum gates. Here the initial step is to prepare a large entangled state
using non-deterministic gates. A key question in this context is the relative
efficiencies of different `strategies', i.e. in what order should the
non-deterministic gates be applied, in order to maximize the size of the
resulting cluster states? In this paper we consider this issue in the context
of `large' cluster states. Specifically, we assume an unlimited resource of
qubits and ask what the steady state rate at which `large' clusters are
prepared from this resource is, given an entangling gate with particular
characteristics. We measure this rate in terms of the number of entangling gate
operations that are applied. Our approach works for a variety of different
entangling gate types, with arbitrary failure probability. Our results indicate
that strategies whereby one preferentially bonds together identical qubits are
considerably more efficient than those in which one does not. Additionally,
compared to earlier analytic results, our numerical study offers substantially
improved resource scaling.

amount of experiments have confirmed this theory and many technological
applications are based on it. Nevertheless, at one century since its
development, various aspects concerning its very foundations still remain to be
clarified. Among them, the transition from a microscopic probabilistic world
into a macroscopic deterministic one and quantum non-locality. A possible way
out from these problems would be if QM represents a statistical approximation
of an unknown deterministic theory.
  This review is addressed to present the most recent progresses on the studies
related to Hidden Variable Theories (HVT), both from an experimental and a
theoretical point of view, giving a larger emphasis to results with a direct
experimental application.
  More in details, the first part of the review is a historical introduction to
this problem. The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen argument and the first discussions
about HVT are introduced, describing the fundamental Bell's proposal for a
general experimental test of every Local HVT and the first attempts to realise
it.
  The second part of the review is devoted to elucidate the recent progresses
toward a conclusive Bell inequalities experiment obtained with entangled
photons and other physical systems.
  Finally, the last sections are targeted to shortly discuss Non-Local HVT.

analytically study the degradation of entanglement due to the Unruh effect, in
the cases of either one or both observers undergoing uniform acceleration. We
find that for two observers undergoing finite acceleration, the entanglement

precisely explained as a redistribution of the inertial entanglement into
multipartite quantum correlations among accessible and unaccessible modes from
a non-inertial perspective. We show that classical correlations are also lost
from the perspective of two accelerated observers but conserved if one of the
observers remains inertial.

memory devices for coherent optical information processing. Specifically, the
number of ultraslow pulses that can be simultaneously present within the
storage time in the condensate has been analyzed. By modeling short-pulse
propagation through the condensate, taking into account high-order dispersive
properties, constraints on the information storage capacity are discussed. The
roles of temperature, spatial inhomogeneity, the interatomic interactions, and
the coupling laser on the pulse shape are pointed out. For a restricted set of

  system. II. Average-value data with a constant, a Gaussian-like, and a Slater
  prior</title><description>  This paper offers examples of concrete numerical applications of Bayesian
quantum-state assignment methods to a three-level quantum system. The
statistical operator assigned on the evidence of various measurement data and
kinds of prior knowledge is computed partly analytically, partly through
numerical integration (in eight dimensions) on a computer. The measurement data
consist in the average of outcome values of N identical von Neumann projective
measurements performed on N identically prepared three-level systems. In
particular the large-N limit will be considered. Three kinds of prior knowledge
are used: one represented by a plausibility distribution constant in respect of
the convex structure of the set of statistical operators; another one
represented by a prior studied by Slater, which has been proposed as the
natural measure on the set of statistical operators; the last prior is
represented by a Gaussian-like distribution centred on a pure statistical
operator, and thus reflecting a situation in which one has useful prior
knowledge about the likely preparation of the system. The assigned statistical
operators obtained with the first two kinds of priors are compared with the one
obtained by Jaynes' maximum entropy method for the same measurement situation.
In the companion paper the case of measurement data consisting in absolute
frequencies is considered.

discussions concerning hidden variables in quantum mechanics. In this paper we
argue that &quot;free will&quot; can be defined in different ways. The definition usually
employed is clearly invalid in strictly deterministic theories. A different,
more precise formulation is proposed here, defining a condition that may well
be a more suitable one to impose on theoretical constructions and models. Our
axiom, to be referred to as the `unconstrained initial state' condition, has
consequences similar to &quot;free will&quot;, but does not clash with determinism, and
appears to lead to different conclusions concerning causality and locality in
quantum mechanics. Models proposed earlier by this author fall in this
category. Imposing our `unconstrained initial state' condition on a
deterministic theory underlying Quantum Mechanics, appears to lead to a
restricted free-will condition in the quantum system: an observer has the free
will to modify the setting of a measuring device, but has no control over the
phase of its wave function. The dismissal of the usual &quot;free will&quot; concept does
not have any consequences for our views and interpretations of human activities
in daily life, and the way our minds function, but it requires a more careful
discussion on what, in practice, free will actually amounts to.

the content of the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Here we isolate the ingredients of
the theorem and provide generalisations of some of them with the aim of
identifying new classes of simulable quantum computations. In the usual
construction, Clifford operations arise as projective normalisers of the first

group by an arbitrary finite subgroup G of U(d). In particular we seek G such
that G tensor G has an entangling normaliser. Via a generalisation of the
Gottesman-Knill theorem the resulting normalisers lead to classes of quantum
circuits that can be classically efficiently simulated. For the qubit case d=2
we exhaustively treat all finite subgroups of U(2) and find that the only ones

  An alternative interpretation of this experiment is to suppose that the wave

Logic as a propositional logic under two connectives: negation and the &quot;and

connective is neither commutative nor associative. Many properties of this
logic are exhibited, and some small elegant subset is shown to imply all the
properties considered. No independence or completeness result is claimed.
Classical physical systems are exactly characterized by the commutativity, the
associativity, or the monotonicity of the &quot;and then&quot; connective. Entailment is
defined in this logic and can be proved to be a partial order. In orthomodular
lattices, the operation proposed by Finch (1969) satisfies all the properties
studied in this paper. All properties satisfied by Finch's operation in modular
lattices are valid in Hilbert Space Quantum Logic. It is not known whether all
properties of Hilbert Space Quantum Logic are satisfied by Finch's operation in

generalizing Boolean algebras are defined, ideals are characterized and a

cryptosystems which can be implemented with current technology, but which
remain secure even in the presence of quantum computers. Inspired by recent
negative results pertaining to the nonabelian hidden subgroup problem, we
present here a classical algebraic function $f_V(M)$ of a matrix $M$ which we
believe is a one-way function secure against quantum attacks. Specifically,
inverting $f_V$ reduces naturally to solving a hidden subgroup problem over the
general linear group (which is at least as hard as the hidden subgroup problem
over the symmetric group). We also demonstrate a reduction from Graph
Isomorphism to the problem of inverting $f_V$; unlike Graph Isomorphism,
however, the function $f_V$ is random self-reducible and therefore uniformly
hard.
  These results suggest that, unlike Shor's algorithm for the discrete
logarithm--which is, so far, the only successful quantum attack on a classical
one-way function--quantum attacks based on the hidden subgroup problem are
unlikely to work. We also show that reconstructing any entry of $M$, or the
trace of $M$, with nonnegligible advantage is essentially as hard as inverting
$f_V$. Finally, $f_V$ can be efficiently computed and the number of output bits
is less than $1+\epsilon$ times the number of input bits for any $\epsilon &gt;
0$.

generalized measurement. Another paradigm of measurement--arising naturally in
quantum optics, among other fields--is that of continuous-time measurements,
which can be seen as the limit of a consecutive sequence of weak measurements.
They are naturally described in terms of stochastic processes, or
time-dependent random variables. We show that any generalized measurement can
be decomposed as a sequence of weak measurements with a mathematical limit as a
continuous stochastic process. We give an explicit construction for any
generalized measurement, and prove that the resulting continuous evolution, in
the long-time limit, collapses the state of the quantum system to one of the
final states generated by the generalized measurement, being decomposed, with
the correct probabilities. A prominent feature of the construction is the
presence of a feedback mechanism--the instantaneous choice weak measurement at
a given time depends on the outcomes of earlier measurements. For a generalized
measurement with $n$ outcomes, this information is captured by a real
$n$-vector on an $n$-simplex, which obeys a simple classical stochastic
evolution.

the physically relevant point of view, as defined by dynamical, operational, or
fundamental constraints. While reducing to the standard entanglement notion
when preferred observables are restricted to arbitrary local observables acting
on individual subsystems, GE substantially expands subsystem-based entanglement
theories, in terms of both conceptual foundations and range of applicability.
Remarkably, the GE framework allows for non-trivial entanglement to exist
within a single, indecomposable quantum system, demands in general a
distinction between quantum separability and absence of entanglement, and
naturally extends to situations where existing approaches may not be directly
useful -- such as entanglement in arbitrary convex-cones settings and
entanglement for indistinguishable quantum particles. In this paper, we revisit
the main motivations leading to GE, and summarize the accomplishments and
prospects of the GE program to date, with an eye toward conceptual developments
and implications. In particular, we explain how the GE approach both shares
strong points of contact with abstract operational quantum theories and,
ultimately, calls for an observer-dependent redefinition of concepts like
locality, completeness, and reality in quantum theory.

process. We find that there is initially a phase of very fast generation and
spread of entanglement. At the end of this phase the entanglement is typically
maximal. In previous work we proved that the maximal entanglement is reached to
a fixed arbitrary accuracy within $O(N^3)$ steps, where $N$ is the total number
of qubits. Here we provide a detailed and more pedagogical proof. We
demonstrate that one can use the so-called stabilizer gates to simulate this
process efficiently on a classical computer. Furthermore, we discuss three ways
of identifying the transition from the phase of rapid spread of entanglement to
the stationary phase: (i) the time when saturation of the maximal entanglement
is achieved, (ii) the cut-off moment, when the entanglement probability
distribution is practically stationary, and (iii) the moment block entanglement
scales exhibits volume scaling. We furthermore investigate the mixed state and
multipartite setting. Numerically we find that classical and quantum
correlations appear to behave similarly and that there is a well-behaved
phase-space flow of entanglement properties towards an equilibrium, We describe
how the emergence of typical entanglement can be used to create a much simpler
tripartite entanglement description. The results form a bridge between certain
abstract results concerning typical (also known as generic) entanglement
relative to an unbiased distribution on pure states and the more physical
picture of distributions emerging from random local interactions.

nanostructure environment as long-lived, high-fidelity quantum memory. In
particular, we calculate, in the limit of a strong applied magnetic field, the
fidelity versus time of P donor nuclear spins in random bath environments of Si
and GaAs, and the lifetime of excited intrinsic spins in polarized Si and GaAs
environments. In the former situation, the nuclear spin dephases due to
spectral diffusion induced by the dipolar interaction among nuclei in the bath.
We calculate the decay of nuclear spin quantum memory in the context of Hahn
and Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) refocused spin echoes using a formally
exact cluster expansion technique which has previously been successful in
dealing with electron spin dephasing in a solid state nuclear spin bath. With
decoherence dominated by transverse dephasing (T2), we find it feasible to
maintain high fidelity (losses of less than 10^{-6}) quantum memory on nuclear
spins for times of the order of 100 microseconds (GaAs:P) and 1 to 2
milliseconds (natural Si:P) using CPMG pulse sequences of just a few (~2-4)
applied pulses. We also consider the complementary situation of a central
flipped intrinsic nuclear spin in a bath of completely polarized nuclear spins
where decoherence is caused by the direct flip-flop of the central spin with
spins in the bath. Exact numerical calculations that include a sufficiently
large neighborhood of surrounding nuclei show lifetimes on the order of 1-5 ms
for both GaAs and natural Si. Our calculated nuclear spin coherence times may
have significance for solid state quantum computer architectures using
localized electron spins in semiconductors where nuclear spins have been
proposed for quantum memory storage.

called {\it conditional entanglement}. The new measures, built from the known
entanglement measures, are convex, automatically {\it super-additive}, and even
smaller than the regularized versions of the generating measures. More
importantly, new measures can also be built directly from measures of
correlations, enabling us to introduce an {\it additive} measure and generalize
it to a multipartite entanglement measure.

linear optical network. The specific model enables us to consider the effect of
realistic sources of noise and losses on the search efficiency. Photon loss
uniform in all directions is shown to lead to the rescaling of search time.
Deviation from directional uniformity leads to the enhancement of the search
efficiency compared to uniform loss with the same average. In certain cases
even increasing loss in some of the directions can improve search efficiency.
We show that while we approach the classical limit of the general search
algorithm by introducing random phase fluctuations, its utility for searching
is lost. Using numerical methods, we found that for static phase errors the
averaged search efficiency displays a damped oscillatory behaviour that
asymptotically tends to a non-zero value.

  regime</title><description>  Based on macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in linear media, we develop a
general theory of the resonant Casimir-Polder force on an excited two-level
atom in the presence of arbitrary linear bodies, with special emphasis on the
strong-coupling regime where reabsorption of an emitted photon can give rise to
(vacuum) Rabi oscillations. We first derive a simple time-independent
expression for the force by using a dressed-state approximation. For initially
single-quantum excited atom-field systems we then study the dynamics of the
force by starting from the Lorentz force and evaluating its average as a
function of time. For strong atom-field coupling, we find that the force may
undergo damped Rabi oscillations. The damping is due to the decay of both the
atomic excitation and the field excitation, and both amplitude and mean value
of the oscillations depend on the chosen initial state.

of cold bosonic atoms to optical fields. The present scheme is an extension to
interacting bosonic system of the recent work \cite{liu,zhu} on optically
induced spin hall effect in non-interacting atomic system. The system has two
different types of ground states. The 1st type of ground state is a 1/3-factor
Laughlin function, and has the property of chiral - anti-chiral interchange
antisymmetry, while the 2nd type is shown to be a 1/4-factor wave function with
chiral - anti-chiral symmetry. The fractional statistics corresponding to the
fractional spin Hall states are studied in detail, and are discovered to be
different from that corresponding to the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states.
Therefore the present FSHE can be distinguished from FQH regime in the
measurement.

non-periodic (quasi-periodic or more generally aperiodic) critical Heisenberg,
XX and quantum Ising spin chains, e.g. in Fibonacci chains. For marginal and
relevant aperiodic modulations, the entanglement entropy is found to be a
logarithmic function of the block size with log-periodic oscillations. The
effective central charge, c_eff, defined through the constant in front of the

corresponding value in the homogeneous system. In the strong modulation limit,
the ground state is constructed by a renormalization group method and the

protocols implementing secure two-party computations in the light of Mayers'
and Lo's &amp; Chau's no-go theorems of bit commitment and oblivious transfer. In
contrast to the commonly adobted quantum pure two-party model in the literature
where classical communication is normally ignored, we propose an alternative
interpretation for the purification of classical communication in two-party
protocols by introducing a quantum third party for the classical channel. This
interpretation leads to a global three-party model, involving Alice's and Bob's
machines and the environment coupled to the macroscopic channel, using the
decoherence scheme in quantum measurements. This model could give a more
general view on the concealing/binding trade-off of quantum bit commitment
protocols.
  Inspired from this three-party interpretation, we extend the no-go theorems
for denying some classes of two-party protocols having access to some
particular quantum trusted third-parties, known as quantum two-party oracles.
The extension implies that a quantum protocol for implementing secure two-party
computations musts have access to a trusted third-party which erases
information and thus makes dissipation of heat to the environment.

unitary evolution operator to a Hilbert space corresponding to the graph. If
this unitary evolution operator has an associated group of symmetries, then for
certain initial states the walk will be confined to a subspace of the original
Hilbert space. Symmetries of the original graph, given by its automorphism
group, can be inherited by the evolution operator. We show that a quantum walk
confined to the subspace corresponding to this symmetry group can be seen as a
different quantum walk on a smaller quotient graph. We give an explicit
construction of the quotient graph for any subgroup of the automorphism group
and illustrate it with examples. The automorphisms of the quotient graph which
are inherited from the original graph are the original automorphism group
modulo the subgroup used to construct it. We then analyze the behavior of
hitting times on quotient graphs. Hitting time is the average time it takes a
walk to reach a given final vertex from a given initial vertex. It has been
shown in earlier work [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 74}, 042334 (2006)] that the hitting
time can be infinite. We give a condition which determines whether the quotient
graph has infinite hitting times given that they exist in the original graph.
We apply this condition for the examples discussed and determine which quotient
graphs have infinite hitting times. All known examples of quantum walks with
fast hitting times correspond to systems with quotient graphs much smaller than
the original graph; we conjecture that the existence of a small quotient graph
with finite hitting times is necessary for a walk to exhibit a quantum
speed-up.

  Two Quantum Scattering Centers</title><description>  In a recent paper -- F. Ciccarello \emph{et al.}, New J. Phys. \textbf{8},
214 (2006) -- we have demonstrated that the electron transmission properties of
a one-dimensional (1D) wire with two identical embedded spin-1/2 impurities can
be significantly affected by entanglement between the spins of the scattering
centers. Such effect is of particular interest in the control of transmission
of quantum information in nanostructures and can be used as a detection scheme
of maximally entangled states of two localized spins. In this letter, we relax
the constraint that the two magnetic impurities are equal and investigate how
the main results presented in the above paper are affected by a static disorder
in the exchange coupling constants of the impurities. Good robustness against
deviation from impurity symmetry is found for both the entanglement dependent
transmission and the maximally entangled states generation scheme.

Pegg formalism of quantum phase and it is shown that the reduction of phase
fluctuation parameter U with respect to its coherent state value corresponds to

the phase fluctuation parameters. As examples, quantum phase fluctuations in
different optical processes, such as four wave mixing, six wave mixing and
second harmonic generation have been studied by using Carruthers-Nieto quantum

commutation relations between the generalized Pauli operators of N-qudits is
performed in which vertices/points correspond to the operators and edges/lines
join commuting pairs of them. As per two-qubits, all basic properties and
partitionings of the corresponding Pauli graph are embodied in the geometry of
the generalized quadrangle of order two. Here, one identifies the operators
with the points of the quadrangle and groups of maximally commuting subsets of
the operators with the lines of the quadrangle. The three basic partitionings
are (a) a pencil of lines and a cube, (b) a Mermin's array and a bipartite-part
and (c) a maximum independent set and the Petersen graph. These factorizations
stem naturally from the existence of three distinct geometric hyperplanes of
the quadrangle, namely a set of points collinear with a given point, a grid and
an ovoid, which answer to three distinguished subsets of the Pauli graph,
namely a set of six operators commuting with a given one, a Mermin's square,
and set of five mutually non-commuting operators, respectively. The generalized
Pauli graph for multiple qubits is found to follow from symplectic polar spaces
of order two, where maximal totally isotropic subspaces stand for maximal
subsets of mutually commuting operators. The substructure of the (strongly
regular) N-qubit Pauli graph is shown to be pseudo-geometric, i. e., isomorphic
to a graph of a partial geometry. Finally, the (not strongly regular) Pauli
graph of a two-qutrit system is introduced; here it turns out more convenient
to deal with its dual in order to see all the parallels with the two-qubit case
and its surmised relation with the generalized quadrangle Q(4, 3), the dual
ofW(3).

quantum cryptography. For quantum metrology, the use of entangled states has
been discussed and demonstrated as a means of improving the signal-to-noise
ratio. In addition, entangled states have been used in experiments for
efficient quantum state detection and for the measurement of scattering
lengths. In quantum information processing, manipulation of individual quantum
bits allows for the tailored design of specific states that are insensitive to
the detrimental influences of an environment. Such 'decoherence-free subspaces'
protect quantum information and yield significantly enhanced coherence times.
Here we use a decoherence-free subspace with specifically designed entangled
states to demonstrate precision spectroscopy of a pair of trapped Ca+ ions; we
obtain the electric quadrupole moment, which is of use for frequency standard
applications. We find that entangled states are not only useful for enhancing
the signal-to-noise ratio in frequency measurements - a suitably designed pair
of atoms also allows clock measurements in the presence of strong technical
noise. Our technique makes explicit use of non-locality as an entanglement
property and provides an approach for 'designed' quantum metrology.

Building on this analogy we show the exact relationship between the GRW

collisional decoherence model formally equivalent to the GRW master-equation.
This allows for a direct comparison of order of magnitudes of relevant

stressed that the decoherence approach does not lead to a solution of the

quantum phase transition. We investigate its behavior during a quench from a
paramagnetic to ferromagnetic phase caused by a gradual turning off of the
transverse field at a fixed rate characterized by the quench time $\tau_Q$. In
agreement with Kibble-Zurek mechanism, quantum state of the system after the
transition exhibits a characteristic correlation length $\hat\xi$ proportional
to the square root of the quench time $\tau_Q$. The inverse of this correlation
length determines average density of defects after the transition. In this
paper, we show that $\hat\xi$ also controls the entropy of entanglement of a
block of $L$ spins with the rest of the system. For large $L$, this entropy
saturates at $\frac16\log_2\hat\xi$, as might have been expected from the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Close to the critical point, the entropy saturates when
the block size $L\approx\hat\xi$, but -- in the subsequent evolution in the
ferromagnetic phase -- a somewhat larger length scale
$l=\sqrt{\tau_Q}\ln\tau_Q$ develops as a result of quantum dephasing, and the
entropy saturates when $L\approx l$. We also study the spin-spin correlation.
We find that close to the critical point ferromagnetic correlations decay
exponentially with the dynamical correlation length $\hat\xi$, but in the
following evolution this correlation function becomes oscillatory at distances
less than this scale. However, both the wavelength and the correlation length
of these oscillations are still determined by $\hat\xi$. We also derive
probability distribution for the number of kinks in a finite spin chain after
the transition.

semiclassical expansion of the Boltzmann density in configuration space in even
powers of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$. This result permits one
to generate an analogous $\lambda$-expansion for the bulk free energy and
many-body densities. The present paper brings a technically nontrivial
generalization of the Wigner-Kirkwood technique to semi-infinite quantum
fluids, constrained by a plane hard wall impenetrable to particles. In contrast
to the bulk case, the resulting Boltzmann density involves also
position-dependent terms of type $\exp(-2x^2/\lambda^2)$ ($x$ denotes the
distance from the wall boundary) which are non-analytic in $\lambda$. Under
some condition, the analyticity in $\lambda$ is restored by integrating the
Boltzmann density over configuration space; however, in contrast to the bulk
free energy, the semiclassical expansion of the surface part of the free energy
(surface tension) contains odd powers of $\lambda$, too. Explicit expressions
for the leading quantum corrections in the presence of the boundary are given
for the one-body and two-body densities. As model systems for explicit
calculations, we use Coulomb fluids, in particular the one-component plasma
defined in the $\nu$-dimensional (integer $\nu\ge 2$) space.

chaotic dynamical tunneling. First, we suggest a systematic numerical technique
for obtaining complex tunneling trajectories by the gradual deformation of the
classical ones. This provides a natural classification of the tunneling
solutions. Second, we present a heuristic procedure for sorting out the least
suppressed trajectory. As an illustration, we apply our technique to the
process of chaotic tunneling in a quantum mechanical model with two degrees of
freedom. Our analysis reveals rich dynamics of the system. At the classical
level, there exists an infinite set of unstable solutions forming a fractal
structure. This structure is inherited by the complex tunneling paths and plays
the central role in the semiclassical study. The process we consider exhibits
the phenomenon of optimal tunneling: the suppression exponent of the tunneling
probability has a local minimum at a certain energy which is thus (locally) the
optimal energy for tunneling. We test the proposed method by comparison of the
semiclassical results with the results of the exact quantum computations and
find a good agreement.

throughout the entire computational process, this implies that all errors that
appear as a result of the interaction of the information-carrying system with
uncontrolled degrees of freedom must be corrected. But this can only be done at
the expense of an increase in the entropy of the environment corresponding to
the dissipation, in the form of heat, of the ``noisy'' part of the system's
energy.
  This paper gives an expression of that energy in terms of the effective noise
temperature, and analyzes the relationship between the energy dissipation rate
and the rate of computation. Finally, a generalized Clausius principle based on
the concept of effective temperature is presented.

experimentally the information rates available to the legitimate users and the

  systems</title><description>  A novel method is introduced in order to treat the dissipative dynamics of
quantum systems interacting with a bath of classical degrees of freedom. The
method is based upon an extension of the Nos\`e-Hoover chain (constant
temperature) dynamics to quantum-classical systems. Both adiabatic and
nonadiabatic numerical calculations on the relaxation dynamics of the
spin-boson model show that the quantum-classical Nos\`e-Hoover chain dynamics
represents the thermal noise of the bath in an accurate and simple way.
Numerical comparisons, both with the constant energy calculation and with the
quantum-classical Brownian motion treatment of the bath, show that the
quantum-classical Nos\`e-Hoover Chain dynamics can be used to introduce
dissipation in the evolution of a quantum subsystem even with just one degree
of freedom for the bath. The algorithm can be computationally advantageous in
modeling, within computer simulation, the dynamics of a quantum subsystem
interacting with complex molecular environments.

Firstly, we prove analytically with the aid of entanglement witnesses that in a

The effect of white noise is investigated, where the critical point transmutes

the definition of the classical $C$&quot;-numerical range by any of its compact and
connected subgroups $K \subset U(N)$.
  The geometric properties of the relative $C$&quot;-numerical range are analysed in
detail. Counterexamples prove its geometry is more intricate than in the
classical case: e.g. $W_K(C,A)$ is neither star-shaped nor simply-connected.
Yet, a well-known result on the rotational symmetry of the classical
$C$&quot;-numerical range extends to $W_K(C,A)$, as shown by a new approach based on
Lie theory. Furthermore, we concentrate on the subgroup $SU_{\rm loc}(2^n) :=
SU(2)\otimes ... \otimes SU(2)$, i.e. the $n$-fold tensor product of SU(2),
which is of particular interest in applications. In this case, sufficient

smooth out the huge fluctuations that characterise chaotic tunnelling. This is
illustrated in the kicked rotor model (quantum standard map) where the period
of the map is complexified: the associated chaotic classical dynamics, if
significant for $\theta=0$, is blurred out long before the Wick rotation is
completed ($\theta=\pi/2$). The influence of resonances on tunnelling rates
weakens exponentially as $\theta$ increases from zero, all the more rapidly the
sharper the fluctuations. The long range fluctuations can therefore be
identified in a deterministic way without ambiguity. When the last ones have

validity of different approximations. In a large region of the parameter space,
we use a geometric picture in order to obtain both a simple understanding of

dividing the evolution into discrete time steps, with each time step described
by either a phase shift on the basis states or a coherent mixing process
corresponding to a Landau-Zener crossing. We compare the results of the

challenge with neutral atoms, however, is to overcome the limited observation
time. Without exception, quantum effects appeared only after ensemble
averaging. Here we report on a single-photon source with one-and-only-one atom
quasi permanently coupled to a high-finesse cavity. Quasi permanent refers to
our ability to keep the atom long enough to, first, quantify the

a single-photon server delivering up to 300,000 photons for up to 30 seconds.
This is achieved by a unique combination of single-photon generation and atom

the parameter $g$ of the states passes through a critical point. Such a point
can be called a point of quantum phase transition, since at this point, the

interaction, and the interaction between the electron spins by Heisenberg
exchange. Depending on the extent of the overlap between the spatial wave
functions of the electrons, there are two physically different cases, namely
the two qubits either interact with the same set of nuclear spins or they see
different nuclear spin environment. In the two cases, the decoherence of the
two-qubit state is studied analytically. We have identified a class of
two-qubit states which have a rich dynamics when the exchange interaction
between the qubits becomes large in comparison to the hyperfine interaction
strengths. The decoherence time scale is determined as a function of the
bath-spin distribution and the polarizations of the initial two-qubit state.
States with large decoherence times are identified by performing a minimization

Rev. A {\bf 71}, 042308 (2005) \cite{Filip05.pra}), we experimentally
demonstrate a universal, deterministic and high-fidelity squeezing
transformation of an optical field. It relies only on linear optics, homodyne
detection, feedforward and an ancillary squeezed vacuum state, thus direct
interaction between a strong pump and the quantum state is circumvented. We
demonstrate three different squeezing levels for a coherent state input. This
scheme is highly suitable for the fault-tolerant squeezing transformation in a
continuous variable quantum computer.

octanuclear iron(III), Fe8, is treated by an effective Hamiltonian that allows

investigated in the context of classical uncertainty. However, in some domains
(most notably, in computational physics and quantum computing) the nature of
the relevant uncertainty is non-classical, and the laws of classical
probability theory are superseded by those of quantum mechanics. In this paper
we introduce Markovian Entanglement Networks (MEN), a novel class of graphical
representations of quantum-mechanical dependencies in the context of such
non-classical systems. MEN are the quantum-mechanical analogue of Markovian
Networks, a family of undirected graphical representations which, in the
classical domain, exploit a notion of conditional independence among
subsystems.
  After defining a notion of conditional independence appropriate to our domain
(conditional separability), we prove that the conditional separabilities
induced by a quantum-mechanical wave function are effectively reflected in the
graphical structure of MEN. Specifically, we show that for any wave function
there exists a MEN which is a perfect map of its conditional separabilities.
Next, we show how the graphical structure of MEN can be used to effectively
classify the pure states of three-qubit systems. We also demonstrate that, in
large systems, exploiting conditional independencies may dramatically reduce
the computational burden of various inference tasks. In principle, the
graph-theoretic representation of conditional independencies afforded by MEN
may not only facilitate the classical simulation of quantum systems, but also
provide a guide to the efficient design and complexity analysis of quantum
algorithms and circuits.

measurements and a classical communication channel. The minimal set of
measurements is presented as a reconstruction protocol of local covariance
matrices and no previous knowledge of the state is required but its Gaussian
character. The protocol becomes very simple mostly when dealing with Gaussian
states transformed to its standard form, since photocounting/intensity
measurements define the whole set of entangled states. In addition, conditioned
on some prior information, the protocol is also useful for a complete global
state reconstruction.

light forces acting on an atom. It has profound consequences in the
strong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics. For a single atom
trapped inside the cavity, we investigate the atom-cavity system by scanning
the frequency of a probe laser for various atom-cavity detunings. The avoided
crossing between atom and cavity resonance is visible in the transmission of
the cavity. It is also visible in the loss rate of the atom from the
intracavity dipole trap. On the normal-mode resonances, the dominant
contribution to the loss rate originates from dipole-force fluctuations which
are dramatically enhanced in the cavity. This conclusion is supported by

Landuaer[Lan61] to include indeterministic operations and to include logical

extending considerably the validity of previous proofs. This confirms
conjectures made in [Mar05b], in particular that all logical operations may, in

add a non local interaction which depends on two potentials. The model is
solved exactly in terms of a Jost like function which is analytic in the
complex upper half plane. This function vanishes, either on the real axis,
corresponding to bound states, or below it, corresponding to resonances. We
find potentials for which the resonances converge asymptotically toward the
average position of the Riemann zeros. These potentials realize, at the quantum
level, the semiclassical regularization of H = x p proposed by Berry and
Keating. Furthermore, a linear superposition of them, obtained by the action of
integer dilations, yields a Jost function whose real part vanishes at the
Riemann zeros and whose imaginary part resembles the one of the zeta function.
Our results suggest the existence of a quantum mechanical model where the
Riemann zeros would make a point like spectrum embbeded in the continuum. The
associated spectral interpretation would resolve the emission/absortion debate
between Berry-Keating and Connes. Finally, we indicate how our results can be
extended to the Dirichlet L-functions constructed with real characters.

&quot;Which quantum states are universal resources for one-way quantum computation?&quot;
We start by re-examining what is exactly meant by &quot;universality&quot; in quantum
computation, and what the implications are for universal one-way quantum
computation. Given the framework of a measurement-based quantum computer, where
quantum information is processed by local operations only, the most general
universal one-way quantum computer is one which is capable of accepting
arbitrary classical inputs and producing arbitrary quantum outputs--we refer to
this property as CQ-universality. We then show that a systematic study of
CQ-universality in one-way quantum computation is possible by identifying
entanglement features that must be present in every universal resource. These
insights are used to identify several states as being not universal, such as 1D
cluster states, W states, and ground states of non-critical 1D spin systems.
Our criteria are strengthened by considering the efficiency of a quantum
computation, and we find that entanglement measures must obey a certain scaling
law with the system size for all efficient universal resources. This again
leads to examples of non-universal resources, such as, e.g., ground states of
critical 1D spin systems. We also provide several examples of efficient
universal resources, namely graph states corresponding to hexagonal, triangular
and Kagome lattices. Finally, we consider the more general notion of encoded
CQ-universality, where quantum outputs are allowed to be produced in an encoded
form. Again we provide entanglement-based criteria for encoded universality.
Moreover, we present a general procedure to construct encoded universal
resources.

for two electrically or magnetically polarizable particles embedded in a
dispersive magneto-dielectric medium. Unlike previous calculations which infer
the atom-atom interaction from the dilute-medium limit of the macroscopic,
many-body van der Waals interaction, the interaction is calculated directly for
the system of two atoms in a magneto-dielectric medium. Two approaches are
presented, the first based on the quantized electromagnetic field in a
dispersive medium without absorption and the second on Green functions that
allow for absorption. We show that the correct van der Waals interactions are
obtained regardless of whether absorption in the host medium is taken into
account.

the quantum state of their nuclear spins, thus preserving coherences that are
usually destroyed by optical pumping. As group-II-like atoms have a $^1S_0$
closed-shell ground state, nuclear spin and electronic degrees of freedom are
decoupled, allowing for independent manipulation. The hyperfine interaction
that couples these degrees of freedom in excited states can be suppressed
through the application of external magnetic fields. Our protocol employs
resolved-sideband cooling on the forbidden clock transition, $^1S_0 \to
{}^3P_0$, with quenching via coupling to the rapidly decaying $^1P_1$ state,
deep in the Paschen-Back regime. This makes it possible to laser cool neutral
atomic qubits without destroying the quantum information stored in their
nuclear spins, as shown in two examples, $^{171}$Yb and $^{87}$Sr.

Standard methods to measure quantum properties of Bose-Einstein condensates

transmission spectra of a high-Q cavity. This can be extremely useful for

various phases show qualitatively distinct light scattering. Joining the

achieve this goal, namely Standard Quantum Process Tomography (SQPT),
Ancilla-Assisted Process Tomography (AAPT), and the recently proposed scheme of
Direct Characterization of Quantum Dynamics (DCQD). Here, we review these

require. Although a reliable figure-of-merit for process characterization is
not yet available, our analysis can provide a benchmark which is necessary for
choosing the scheme that is the most appropriate in a given situation, with
given resources. As a result, we conclude that for quantum systems where
two-body interactions are not naturally available, SQPT is the most efficient
scheme. However, for quantum systems with controllable two-body interactions,
the DCQD scheme is more efficient than other known QPT schemes in terms of the
total number of required elementary quantum operations.

two-qubit Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) separability probabilities, we are able to
compute. Each probability corresponds to a specific scenario -- a class of 4 x
4 density matrices (rho) with an m-subset (m&lt;6) of its six off-diagonal pairs
of symmetrically located entries set to zero. Initially, we consider only
scenarios in which the (6-m) non-nullified pairs are real, but then permit them
to be complex (as well as quaternionic) in nature also. The general analytical
strategy we implement is based on the Bloore density matrix parameterization
(J. Phys. A, 9, 2059 [1976]), allowing us to conveniently reduce the
dimensionalities of required integrations. For each scenario, we identify a
certain univariate ``separability function'' S_{scenario}(nu), where nu =
rho_{11} rho_{44}/(rho_{22} rho_{33}). The integral over nu in [0,infty] of the
product of this function with a scenario-specific (marginal) jacobian function
J_{scenario}(nu) yields the HS {separable} volume (V^{HS}_{sep}). The ratio of
V^{HS}_{sep} to the HS total (entangled and non-entangled) volume, gives us the
HS scenario-specific separability probability. Among the possible forms that we
have so far determined for S_{scenario}(nu) are piecewise combinations of c, c
sqrt{nu} and c nu for nu in [0,1] and (in a dual manner) c, c/sqrt{nu} and c/nu
for nu in [1,infty]. We also obtain bivariate separability functions
S_{scenario)^{6 x 6}(nu_{1},nu_{2}} in the qubit-qutrit case, involving 6 x 6
density matrices, with ratio variables, nu_{1}= rho_{11} rho_{55}/(rho_{22}
rho_{44}), and nu_{2}= rho_{22} rho_{66}/(rho_{33} rho_{55}). Additionally, we

superposition of two outcomes: each atom continues without scattering and each
atom scatters as a spherically outgoing wave with an s-wave phase shift. The
magnitude of the s-wave phase shift depends very sensitively on the interaction
between the atoms. Quantum scattering and the underlying phase shifts are
vitally important in many areas of contemporary atomic physics, including
Bose-Einstein condensates, degenerate Fermi gases, frequency shifts in atomic
clocks, and magnetically-tuned Feshbach resonances. Precise measurements of
quantum scattering phase shifts have not been possible until now because, in
scattering experiments, the number of scattered atoms depends on the s-wave
phase shifts as well as the atomic density, which cannot be measured precisely.
Here we demonstrate a fundamentally new type of scattering experiment that
interferometrically detects the quantum scattering phase shifts of individual
atoms. By performing an atomic clock measurement using only the scattered part

detrimental effect of decoherence. One set of particles functions as the
quantum information processor, whose evolution is controlled by a
time-dependent external field. The other particles are not directly controlled
and serve as an effective environment, coupling to which is the source of
decoherence. The control objective is to generate target one- and two-qubit
unitary gates in the presence of strong environmentally-induced decoherence and
under physically motivated restrictions on the control field. The quantum-gate
fidelity, expressed in terms of a novel state-independent distance measure, is
maximized with respect to the control field using combined genetic and gradient
algorithms. The resulting high-fidelity gates demonstrate the feasibility of
precisely guiding the quantum evolution via optimal control, even when the
system complexity is exacerbated by environmental coupling. It is found that
the gate duration has an important effect on the control mechanism and
resulting fidelity. An analysis of the sensitivity of the gate performance to
random variations in the system parameters reveals a significant degree of

attempt to derive the finite-dimensional abstract quantum formalism from a set
of physically comprehensible assumptions. In this paper, we formulate a
correspondence principle, the Average-Value Correspondence Principle, that
allows relations between measurement outcomes which are known to hold in a
classical model of a system to be systematically taken over into the quantum
model of the system. Using this principle, we derive the explicit form of the
temporal evolution operator (thereby completing the derivation of the abstract
quantum formalism begun in Paper I), and derive many of the formal rules (such
as operator rules, commutation relations, and Dirac's Poisson bracket rule)
that are needed to apply the abstract quantum formalism to model particular
physical systems.

investigated by exploring the volume of the negative part of the Wigner
function which reduces with the dissipative time. The Wigner functions become
positive when the decay time exceeds a threshold value. For the case of the
single photon-added coherent state, we derive the exact threshold values of
decay time in the thermal channel. For arbitrary partial negative Wigner

Monte Carlo simulations illustrate the validity of this approximation and of
its extension by exponentiation. The results up to this point are also used to
study one qubit decoherence. Purity decay of entangled and product states are
qualitatively similar though for the latter case it is slower. Numerical
studies for a Bell pair as initial state reveal a one to one correspondence
between its decoherence and its internal entanglement decay. For strong and

  Isomers</title><description>  Following excitation by a strong ultra-short laser pulse, molecules develop
coordinated rotational motion, exhibiting transient alignment along the
direction of the laser electric field, followed by periodic full and fractional
revivals that depend on the molecular rotational constants. In mixtures, the
different species undergo similar rotational dynamics, all starting together
but evolving differently with each demonstrating its own periodic revival
cycles. For a bimolecular mixture of linear molecules, at predetermined times,
one species may attain a maximally aligned state while the other is
anti-aligned (i.e. molecular axes are confined in a plane perpendicular to the
laser electric field direction). By a properly timed second laser pulse, the
rotational excitation of the undesired species may be almost completely removed
leaving only the desired species to rotate and periodically realign, thus
facilitating further selective manipulations by polarized light. In this paper,
such double excitation schemes are demonstrated for mixtures of molecular
isotopes (isotopologues) and for nuclear spin isomers.

characterization of the phenomenon of quantum catalysis: when can the
surrounding entanglement be used to perform transformations of a jointly held
quantum state under LOCC (local operations and classical communication) ?
Mathematically, the question amounts to describe, for a fixed vector $y$, the
set $T(y)$ of vectors $x$ such that we have $x \otimes z \prec y \otimes z$ for
some $z$, where $\prec$ denotes the standard majorization relation. Our main
result is that the closure of $T(y)$ in the $\ell_1$ norm can be fully
described by inequalities on the $\ell_p$ norms: $\|x\|_p \leq \|y\|_p$ for all
$p \geq 1$. This is a first step towards a complete description of $T(y)$
itself. It can also be seen as a $\ell_p$-norm analogue of Ky Fan dominance
theorem about unitarily invariant norms. The proofs exploits links with another
quantum phenomenon: the possibiliy of multiple-copy transformations
($x^{\otimes n} \prec y^{\otimes n}$ for given $n$). The main new tool is a

  autonomous systems. The case of Quantum Kicked Top</title><description>  Properties related to entanglement in quantum systems, are known to be
associated with distinct properties of the corresponding classical systems, as
for example stability, integrability and chaos. This means that the detailed
topology, both local and global, of the classical phase space may reveal, or
influence, the entangling power of the quantum system. As it has been shown in
the literature, the bifurcation points, in autonomous dynamical systems, play a
crucial role for the onset of entanglement. Similarly, the existence of scars
among the quantum states seems to be a factor in the dynamics of entanglement.
Here we study these issues for a non-autonomous system, the Quantum Kicked Top,
as a collective model of a multi-qubit system. Using the bifurcation diagram of
the corresponding classical limit (the Classical Kicked Top), we analyzed the
pair-wise and the bi-partite entanglement of the qubits and their relation to
scars, as a function of the critical parameter of the system. We found that the
pair-wise entanglement and pair-wise negativity show a strong maximum precisely
at the bifurcation points, while the bi-partite entanglement changes slope at
these points. We have also investigated the connection between entanglement and
the fixed points on the branch of the bifurcation diagram between the two first
bifurcation points and we found that the entanglement measures take their
extreme values precisely on these points. We conjecture that our results on
this behaviour of entanglement is generic for many quantum systems with a
non-linear classical analogue.

ions through complex segmented ion trap structures in order to scale up to much
larger numbers of trapped ion qubits. This paper covers several important
issues relevant to ion transport in any type of complex multidimensional rf
(Paul) ion trap array. We develop a general theoretical framework for the
application of time-dependent electric fields to shuttle laser-cooled ions
along any desired trajectory, and describe a method for determining the effect
of arbitrary shuttling schedules on the quantum state of trapped ion motion. In
addition to the general case of linear shuttling over short distances, we
introduce issues particular to the shuttling through multidimensional
junctions, which are required for the arbitrary control of the positions of
large arrays of trapped ions. This includes the transport of ions around a
corner, through a cross or T junction, and the swapping of positions of
multiple ions in a laser-cooled crystal. Where possible, we make connections to
recent experimental results in a multidimensional T junction trap, where
arbitrary 2-dimensional transport was realized.

that of symmetries and entanglement. We introduce the concept of
low-dimensional Gauge-Like Symmetries (GLSs), and the physical conservation
laws (including topological terms and fractionalization) which emerge from
them. We prove then sufficient conditions for TQO at both zero and finite
temperatures. The topological defects which are associated with the restoration
of GLSs lead to TQO. Selection rules associated with the GLSs enable us to
systematically construct states with TQO; these selection rules do not rely on
the existence of a finite gap between the ground states to all other excited
states. All currently known examples of TQO display GLSs. We analyze spectral
structures and show that Kitaev's toric code model and Wen's plaquette model
are equivalent and reduce, by a duality mapping, to an Ising chain. Despite the
spectral gap in these systems, the toric operator expectation values may vanish
once thermal fluctuations are present. This mapping illustrates that the
quantum states themselves in a particular (operator language) representation
encode TQO and that the duality mappings, being non-local in the original
representation, disentangle the order. We present a general algorithm for the
construction of long-range string orders in general systems with entangled
ground states.

history of this question is reviewed. Nonlinear generalizations of quantum
mechanics have been proposed. They predict small but clear nonlinear effects,
which very accurate experiments have not seen. Is there a reason in principle
why nonlinearity is not found? Is it impossible? Does quantum dynamics have to
be linear? Attempts to prove this have not been decisive, because either their
assumptions are not compelling or their arguments are not conclusive. The
question has been left unsettled. There is a simple answer, based on a simple
assumption. It was found in two steps separated by 44 years. They are steps
back to simpler and more compelling assumptions. A proof of the assumptions of
the Wigner-Bargmann proof has been known since 1962. It assumes that the maps
of density matrices in time are linear. For this step, it is also assumed that
density matrices are mapped one-to-one onto density matrices. An alternative is
to assume that pure states are mapped one-to-one onto pure states and that
entropy does not decrease. In a step taken in 2006, it is proved that the maps
of density matrices in time are linear. It is assumed, as in the earlier step,
that at each time the physical quantities and states are described by the usual
linear structures of quantum mechanics, so the question is only about how
things change in time. Beyond that, the proof assumes only that the dynamics
does not depend on anything outside the system, but must allow the system to be
described as part of a larger system.

break down the RSA public-key cryptosystem, which is widely used in many
cryptographic applications. Thus, public-key cryptosystems in the quantum
computational setting are longed for cryptology. In order to define the
security notions of public-key cryptosystems, we have to model the power of the
sender, receiver, adversary and channel. While we may consider a setting where
quantum computers are available only to adversaries, we generally discuss what
are the right security notions for (quantum) public-key cryptosystems in the
quantum computational setting. Moreover, we consider the security of quantum
public-key cryptosystems known so far.

Moreover, we show that the violation obtained from generalized GHZ states is

  probe of quantum statistics</title><description>  We study off-resonant collective light scattering from ultracold atoms
trapped in an optical lattice. Scattering from different atomic quantum states
creates different quantum states of the scattered light, which can be
distinguished by measurements of the spatial intensity distribution, quadrature
variances, photon statistics, or spectral measurements. In particular,
angle-resolved intensity measurements reflect global statistics of atoms (total
number of radiating atoms) as well as local statistical quantities (single-site
statistics even without an optical access to a single site) and pair
correlations between different sites. As a striking example we consider
scattering from transversally illuminated atoms into an optical cavity mode.
For the Mott insulator state, similar to classical diffraction, the number of
photons scattered into a cavity is zero due to destructive interference, while
for the superfluid state it is nonzero and proportional to the number of atoms.
Moreover, we demonstrate that light scattering into a standing-wave cavity has
a nontrivial angle dependence, including the appearance of narrow features at
angles, where classical diffraction predicts zero. The measurement procedure
corresponds to the quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement of various atomic
variables by observing light.

presented that is subject to scattering event with small momentum transfer. It
is suited for three dimensions and allows for an additional potential. For a
random value of a phase parameter, it is equivalent to the decoherence by
scattering off plane wave field states. Imposing some condition on the same
phase parameter, the model delivers definite outcomes in a local pointer base.
Common sense notions about the quantum-classical transition are readily
obtained: Decoherent free particle solutions are localized constant-width
wavepackets, quantum barrier scattering results in random reflection and
transmission. The scattering process assumed in the phenomenological model is
realized by scattering of a particle pair interacting by a force-distance law
with small momentum transfer. Particles are localized not by decoherence but by
a classical lensing effect. Schmidt paths in the Schmidt representation of the
multiparticle state are products of single-particle wavepackets. Therefore the
model has a natural 'Many Worlds' interpretation, identifying each Schmidt path
with a classical branch. Different runs of the phenomenological model map the
state of the same particular particle within different branches.

to two decay processes. One is radiative relaxation and the other is
pure-dephasing due to exciton-phonon interaction. The former results in a decay
with an exponent linear to time, while the latter causes a faster initial decay
than the radiative decay. We analyzed the dependence of the components on the
duration of the input one-photon pulse, temperature, and radiative relaxation
rates. Such a quantitative analysis is important for the developments of
atom-photon interfaces which enable coherent transfer of quantum information
between photons and atomic systems. We found that, for a GaAs spherical quantum

of the excited state can be increased up to 75 %. This probability can be
considered as the efficiency for quantum information transfer from photon to
exciton.

  Grothendieck bound</title><description>  Contemporary versions of Bell's argument against local hidden variable (LHV)
theories are based on the Clauser Horne Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality, and
various attempts to generalize it. The amount of violation of these
inequalities cannot exceed the bound set by the Grothendieck constants.
However, if we go back to the original derivation by Bell, and use the perfect
anti-correlation embodied in the singlet spin state, we can go beyond these
bounds. In this paper we derive two-particle Bell inequalities for traceless
two-outcome observables, whose violation in the singlet spin state go beyond
the Grothendieck constants both for the two and three dimensional cases.
Moreover, creating a higher dimensional analog of perfect correlations, and
applying a recent result of Alon and his associates (Invent. Math. 163 499
(2006)) we prove that there are two-particle Bell inequalities for traceless
two-outcome observables whose violation increases to infinity as the dimension
and number of measurements grow. Technically these result are possible because
perfect correlations (or anti-correlations) allow us to transport the indices
of the inequality from the edges of a bipartite graph to those of the complete
graph. Finally, it is shown how to apply these results to mixed Werner states,
provided that the noise does not exceed 20%.

causes random changes in photon number. If more than one photon appears in the
output, the continuous-variable teleportation accidentally produces clones of
the original input photon. In this paper, we derive the polarization statistics
of the $N$-photon output components and show that they can be decomposed into
an optimal cloning term and completely unpolarized noise. We find that the
accidental cloning of the input photon is nearly optimal at experimentally

algorithm can be implemented purely through local measurements on the
individual qubits. Measurements can also be used to create the graph state:
Path erasure techniques allow one to entangle multiple qubits by determining
only global properties of the qubits. Here, this powerful approach is extended
by demonstrating that even imperfect path erasure can produce the required
graph states with high efficiency. By characterizing the degree of error in
each path erasure attempt, one can subsume the resulting imperfect entanglement
into an extended graph state formalism. The subsequent growth of the improper
graph state can be guided, through a series of strategic decisions, in such a

  Computation</title><description>  We extend the notion of quantum information flow defined by Danos and Kashefi
for the one-way model and present a necessary and sufficient condition for the
deterministic computation in this model. The generalized flow also applied in
the extended model with measurements in the X-Y, X-Z and Y-Z planes. We apply
both measurement calculus and the stabiliser formalism to derive our main
theorem which for the first time gives a full characterization of the
deterministic computation in the one-way model. We present several examples to
show how our result improves over the traditional notion of flow, such as
geometries (entanglement graph with input and output) with no flow but having
generalized flow and we discuss how they lead to an optimal implementation of
the unitaries. More importantly one can also obtain a better quantum
computation depth with the generalized flow rather than with flow. We believe
our characterization result is particularly essential for the study of the
algorithms and complexity in the one-way model.

formalism of quantum mechanics are analyzed. It is shown that, in general, a
careful definition of an approximation method requires the introduction of two
length parameters, one of them always considered in the text books on quantum

particular family of potentials and prove, resorting to the aforementioned
length parameters, that we may find an energy which is a lower bound to the
ground energy of the system. The idea is applied to the case of a harmonic
oscillator and also to a particle freely falling in a homogeneous gravitational
field, and in both cases the consistency of our method is corroborated. This
approach, together with the Rayleigh--Ritz formalism, allows us to define an
energy interval in which the ground energy of any potential, belonging to our
family, must lie.

that does not contain a selection device. The double-slit is replaced by two
separate coherent laser beams that overlap under a small angle. At the

In the far field the beams separate without the use of a lens system. Momentum

The general theory of unambiguous discrimination among unitary operators is
extended with this application in mind. We prove that entanglement with an
ancilla cannot assist any discrimination strategy for commuting unitary
operators. We also obtain a simple, practical test for the unambiguous
distinguishability of an arbitrary set of unitary operators on a given system.
Using this result, we prove that the unambiguous distinguishability criterion
is the same for both standard and minimal oracle operators. We then show that,
except in certain trivial cases, unambiguous discrimination among all standard
oracle operators corresponding to integer functions with fixed domain and range
is impossible. However, we find that it is possible to unambiguously
discriminate among the Grover oracle operators corresponding to an arbitrarily
large unsorted database. The unambiguous distinguishability of standard oracle
operators corresponding to totally indistinguishable functions, which possess a
strong form of classical indistinguishability, is analysed. We prove that these
operators are not unambiguously distinguishable for any finite set of totally
indistinguishable functions on a Boolean domain and with arbitrary fixed range.
Sets of such functions on a larger domain can have unambiguously
distinguishable standard oracle operators and we provide a complete analysis of
the simplest case, that of four functions. We also examine the possibility of
unambiguous oracle operator discrimination with multiple parallel calls and
investigate an intriguing unitary superoperator transformation between standard
and entanglement-assisted minimal oracle operators.

{\it what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in laboratory}. But the
essence of quantum formalism - entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky,
Rosen and Schr\&quot;odinger - waited over 70 years to enter to laboratories as a
new resource as real as energy.
  This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves
nonclassical correlations between subsystems, is a potential for many quantum
processes, including ``canonical'' ones: quantum cryptography, quantum
teleportation and dense coding. However, it appeared that this new resource is
very complex and difficult to detect. Being usually fragile to environment, it
is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to
decipher its rich structure.
  This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its
characterization, detection, distillation and quantifying. In particular, the
authors discuss various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities,
entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, quantum cryptography and point
out some interrelations. They also discuss a basic role of entanglement in
quantum communication within distant labs paradigm and stress some
peculiarities such as irreversibility of entanglement manipulations including
its extremal form - bound entanglement phenomenon. A basic role of entanglement
witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.

  superlattices</title><description>  We propose a method for the fast generation of a quantum register of
addressable qubits consisting of ultracold atoms stored in an optical lattice.
Starting with a half filled lattice we remove every second lattice barrier by
adiabatically switching on a superlattice potential which leads to a long
wavelength lattice in the Mott insulator state with unit filling. The larger
periodicity of the resulting lattice could make individual addressing of the
atoms via an external laser feasible. We develop a Bose-Hubbard-like model for
describing the dynamics of cold atoms in a lattice when doubling the lattice
periodicity via the addition of a superlattice potential. The dynamics of the
transition from a half filled to a commensurately filled lattice is analyzed
numerically with the help of the Time Evolving Block Decimation algorithm and
analytically using the Kibble-Zurek theory. We show that the time scale for the
whole process, i.e. creating the half filled lattice and subsequent doubling of
the lattice periodicity, is significantly faster than adiabatic direct quantum
freezing of a superfluid into a Mott insulator for large lattice periods. Our
method therefore provides a high fidelity quantum register of addressable
qubits on a fast time scale.

conventional voltage sources can only generate classical fields with a coherent
superposition of many different photon numbers. While these classical signals
can control and measure bits in a quantum computer (qubits), single photons can
carry quantum information, enabling non-local quantum interactions, an
important resource for scalable quantum computing. Here, we demonstrate an
on-chip single photon source in a circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED)
architecture, with a microwave transmission line cavity that collects the
spontaneous emission of a single superconducting qubit with high efficiency.
The photon source is triggered by a qubit rotation, as a photon is generated
only when the qubit is excited. Tomography of both qubit and fluorescence
photon shows that arbitrary qubit states can be mapped onto the photon state,
demonstrating an ability to convert a stationary qubit into a flying qubit.
Both the average power and voltage of the photon source are characterized to
verify performance of the system. This single photon source is an important
addition to a rapidly growing toolbox for quantum optics on a chip.

inversely proportionally to the power of time in the asymptotic region. This is
the same condition as the other implementations of quantum annealing, quantum

which is stored in pairwise entanglement, and the way such fraction distributes

length-scale naturally emerges in the system, which is specifically related
with entanglement properties and diverges at the critical point of the fully

the entanglement properties, which results in the fact that more isotropic

present a smaller fraction of pairwise entanglement: the latter, in turn, is
more evenly distributed along the chain, to the extent that, in the fully
isotropic model at the critical field, the concurrences do not depend on $r$.

superconducting qubits, a prime example being the operation of such devices at
optimal working points, so-called &quot;sweet spots.&quot; This latter approach led to
significant improvement of $T_2$ times in Cooper pair box qubits [D. Vion et

qubit called the &quot;transmon.&quot; Unlike the charge qubit, the transmon is designed
to operate in a regime of significantly increased ratio of Josephson energy and
charging energy $E_J/E_C$. The transmon benefits from the fact that its charge
dispersion decreases exponentially with $E_J/E_C$, while its loss in
anharmonicity is described by a weak power law. As a result, we predict a
drastic reduction in sensitivity to charge noise relative to the Cooper pair
box and an increase in the qubit-photon coupling, while maintaining sufficient
anharmonicity for selective qubit control. Our detailed analysis of the full
system shows that this gain is not compromised by increased noise in other
known channels.

Using the variational method, we confirm that this dissipation term is a

mechanics with game theory by introducing non-classical resources such as
entanglement, quantum operations and quantum measurement. By transferring
two-player-two strategy (2x2) dilemma containing classical games into quantum
realm, dilemmas can be resolved in quantum pure strategies if entanglement is
distributed between the players who use quantum operations. Moreover, players
receive the highest sum of payoffs available in the game, which are otherwise
impossible in classical pure strategies. Encouraged by the observation of rich
dynamics of physical systems with many interacting parties and the power of
entanglement in quantum versions of 2x2 games, it became generally accepted
that quantum versions can be easily extended to N-player situations by simply
allowing N-partite entangled states. In this article, however, we show that
this is not generally true because the reproducibility of classical tasks in
quantum domain imposes limitations on the type of entanglement and quantum
operators. We propose a benchmark for the evaluation of quantum and classical
versions of games, and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a
physical realization. We give examples of entangled states that can and cannot

nonlinear stochastic extension of Schr\&quot;odinger's equation is outlined. The
eigenstates of the annihilation operator are chosen as the preferred basis onto
which reduction occurs. These are the coherent states which saturate the bound
of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, exhibiting classical-like behavior. The
quantum harmonic oscillator is studied in detail before generalizing to
relativistic scalar quantum field theory. The infinite rates of increase in
energy density which have plagued recent relativistic proposals of dynamical
state reduction are absent in this model. This is because the state evolution
equation does not drive particle creation from the vacuum. The model requires
the specification of a preferred sequence of space-like hyper-surfaces
supporting the time-like state evolution. However, it is shown that the choice
of preferred surfaces has no effect on perturbative results to second order in
the coupling parameter. It is demonstrated how state reduction to a charge

a bosonic field undergoing this mechanism.

studied using analytic methods as well as large scale numerical density matrix
renormalization group methods. The entanglement is investigated in terms of the
von Neumann entropy, S=-Tr rho_A log rho_A, for a sub-system A of size r of the
chain. The impurity contribution to the uniform part of the entanglement
entropy, S_{imp}, is defined and analyzed in detail in both the gapless, J_2 &lt;=
J_2^c, as well as the dimerized phase, J_2&gt;J_2^c, of the model. This quantum
impurity model is in the universality class of the single channel Kondo model
and it is shown that in a quite universal way the presence of the impurity in
the gapless phase, J_2 &lt;= J_2^c, gives rise to a large length scale, xi_K,
associated with the screening of the impurity, the size of the Kondo screening
cloud. The universality of Kondo physics then implies scaling of the form
S_{imp}(r/xi_K,r/R) for a system of size R. Numerical results are presented
clearly demonstrating this scaling. At the critical point, J_2^c, an analytic
Fermi liquid picture is developed and analytic results are obtained both at T=0
and T&gt;0. In the dimerized phase an appealing picure of the entanglement is
developed in terms of a thin soliton (TS) ansatz and the notions of impurity
valence bonds (IVB) and single particle entanglement (SPE) are introduced. The
TS-ansatz permits a variational calculation of the complete entanglement in the
dimerized phase that appears to be exact in the thermodynamic limit at the
Majumdar-Ghosh point, J_2=J_1/2, and surprisingly precise even close to the
critical point J_2^c. In appendices the relation between the finite temperature

acquires an additional non-Markovian element. We investigate the time evolution
of an entangled many-qubit W state, which for vanishing qubit separation
remains robust under pure dephasing. For finite separation, by contrast, the
dynamics is no longer decoherence-free. On the other hand, spatial noise
correlations may prevent a complete dephasing. While a standard Bloch-Redfield
master equation fails to describe this behavior even qualitatively, we propose
instead a widely applicable causal master equation. Here we employ it to

\textit{concurrence} and \textit{negativity}) are rough benchmarks, and not
monotones of each other. Considering the specific case of two qubit mixed

show that it is characterised by a set of parameters, of which concurrence is

Entanglement teleportation will be better realized via antiferromagnetic spin

However, the introduction of DM interaction can cause the ferromagnetic spin

is to stay close to the standard formalism of quantum mechanics and to refrain
from introducing new structure by hand. In this paper we explain how this
programme can be made concrete. In particular, we show that the Born

probabilities pertain, can be uniquely defined from the quantum state and
Hilbert space structure. We discuss the status of probability in modal

the combination of the second law of thermodynamics and the Markov postulate.
Violations of these inequalities are discussed in terms of the mixing
characteristics of the density operators. A quantum mechanical bound for a
system of three qubits, two of which are entangled, is found and is shown to
lead to strong subadditivity in one case. Finally, in interpreting the results,
the role the uncertainty relations play in the definition of entropy and the
second law is discussed, demonstrating a link to Bell's inequalities.
Additionally the second law is shown to be dependent on the type of measurement
in quantum systems. Specifically, a more general statement of the second law
appropriate to both quantum and classical systems is suggested.

(RSP) of disordered quantum magnetic chains of general spin-S. Through an
analysis of the general structure of the RSP, we show that the entanglement
entropy scales logarithmically with the size of a block and we provide a closed
expression for this scaling. This result is applicable for arbitrary quantum
spin chains in the RSP, being dependent only on the magnitude S of the spin.
Remarkably, the logarithmic scaling holds for the disordered chain even if the
pure chain with no disorder does not exhibit conformal invariance, as is the
case for Heisenberg integer spin chains. Our conclusions are supported by
explicit evaluations of the entanglement entropy for random spin-1 and spin-3/2
chains using an asymptotically exact real-space renormalization group approach.

continuous dependence on time of an evolving state of some kind. This leads to
a false dilemma: quantum states are either objective states of nature or
subjective states of belief. In reality they are neither. The present paper
views the aforesaid dependence as a dependence on the time of the measurement
to whose possible outcomes the quantum state serves to assign probabilities.
This makes it possible to recognize the full implications of the only testable

provides a strong argument that the observable universe represents a finite
causal region with finite material and informational resources. A similar
conclusion follows from the holographic principle. In this paper I address the
question of whether the cosmological information bound has implications for
fundamental physics. Orthodox physics is based on Platonism: the laws are
treated as infinitely precise, perfect, immutable mathematical relationships
that transcend the physical universe and remain totally unchanged by physical
processes, however extreme. If instead the laws of physics are regarded as akin
to computer software, with the physical universe as the corresponding hardware,
then the finite computational capacity of the universe imposes a fundamental
limit on the precision of the laws and the specifiability of physical states.
That limit depends on the age of the universe. I examine how the imprecision of
the laws impacts on the evolution of highly entangled states and on the problem
of dark energy.

First we study the variance of a real variable associated to the POVM outcomes.
In this context we introduce an uncertainty operator which measures how much
additional noise is introduced by carrying out a POVM rather than a von Neumann
measurement. We illustrate this first approach by studying the variances of
joint estimates of \sigma_x and \sigma_z for spin 1/2 particles. We show that
for unbiased measurements the sum of these variances is lower bounded by 1. In
our second approach we study the entropy of the POVM outcomes. In particular we
try to establish lower bounds on the entropy of the POVM outcomes. We
illustrate this second approach by examples.

transition in the dynamics of a two spin experimental swapping gate [J. Chem.
Phys. 124, 194507 (2006)]. There, the exchange of the coupled states |+,-&gt; and
,+&gt; gives an oscillation with a Rabi frecuency b/$\hbar$ (the spins coupling).
The interaction, $\hbar$/tSE with a spin-bath degrades the oscillation with a
characteristic decoherence time. We showed that the swapping regime is
restricted only to b\tSE&gt;$hbar$. However, beyond a critical interaction with
the environment the swapping freezes and the system enters to a Quantum Zeno
dynamical phase where relaxation decreases as coupling with the environment
increases. Here, we solve the quantum dynamics of a two spin system coupled to
a spin-bath within a Liouville-von Neumann quantum master equation and we
compare the results with our previous work within the Keldysh formalism. Then,
we extend the model to a three interacting spin system where only one is
coupled to the environment. Beyond a critical interaction the two spins not
coupled to the environment oscillate with the bare Rabi frequency and relax
more slowly. This effect is more pronounced when the anisotropy of the
system-environment interaction goes from a purely XY to an Ising interaction
form.

As an application of our formalism, we study a simple one-qubit model where the

tunable coupling with an ancillary qubit. It is found that the evolution
through mixed states can be more efficient than the unitary evolution between

and its environment is of an energy-preserving quantum nondemolition (QND)
type. We obtain the general master equation for the evolution of such a system
under the influence of a squeezed thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. From
the master equation it can be seen explicitly that the process involves
decoherence or dephasing without any dissipation of energy. We work out the
decoherence-causing term in the high and zero temperature limits and check that
they match with known results for the case of a thermal bath. The decay of the
coherence is quantified as well by the dynamics of the linear entropy of the
system under various environmental conditions. We make a comparison of the
quantum statistical properties between QND and dissipative types of evolution
using a system of two-level atom and a harmonic oscillator.

Quantum Mechanics. If a system may be in any one of two pure states x and y, we
must consider that it may also be in any one of many superpositions of x and y.
An in-depth analysis of superpositions is proposed, in which states are
represented by one-dimensional subspaces, not by unit vectors as in Dirac's
notation. Superpositions must be considered when one cannot distinguish between
possible paths, i.e., histories, leading to the current state of the system. In
such a case the resulting state is some compound of the states that result from
each of the possible paths. States can be compounded, i.e., superposed in such
a way only if they are not orthogonal. Since different classical states are
orthogonal, the claim implies no non-trivial superpositions can be observed in
classical systems. The parameter that defines such compounds is a proportion
defining the mix of the different states entering the compound. Two quantities,
p and theta, both geometrical in nature, relate one-dimensional subspaces in
complex Hilbert spaces: the first one is a measure of proximity relating two
rays, the second one is an angle relating three rays. The properties of the
operation of superposition are very different from those that govern linear
combination of vectors.

second is a higher-order, typed language L(S). Both languages provide deductive
systems with an intuitionistic logic. The reason for introducing PL(S) is that,
as shown in paper II of the series, it is the easiest way of understanding, and
expanding on, the earlier work on topos theory and quantum physics. However,
the main thrust of our programme utilises the more powerful language L(S) and
its representation in an appropriate topos.

  Liberation of Quantum Theory</title><description>  This paper is the second in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally

to address certain deep issues that arise when contemplating quantum theories
of space and time. Our basic contention is that constructing a theory of
physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a topos of a certain
formal language that is attached to the system. Classical physics arises when
the topos is the category of sets. Other types of theory employ a different
topos. In this paper, we study in depth the topos representation of the
propositional language, PL(S), for the case of quantum theory. In doing so, we
make a direct link with, and clarify, the earlier work on applying topos theory
to quantum physics. The key step is a process we term `daseinisation' by which
a projection operator is mapped to a sub-object of the spectral presheaf--the
topos quantum analogue of a classical state space. In the second part of the
paper we change gear with the introduction of the more sophisticated local
language L(S). From this point forward, throughout the rest of the series of
papers, our attention will be devoted almost entirely to this language. In the
present paper, we use L(S) to study `truth objects' in the topos. These are
objects in the topos that play the role of states: a necessary development as
the spectral presheaf has no global elements, and hence there are no
microstates in the sense of classical physics. Truth objects therefore play a
crucial role in our formalism.

new way of viewing theories of physics. Our basic contention is that
constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to finding a representation in a
topos of a certain formal language that is attached to the system. In paper II,
we studied the topos representations of the propositional language PL(S) for
the case of quantum theory, and in the present paper we do the same thing for
the, more extensive, local language L(S). One of the main achievements is to
find a topos representation for self-adjoint operators. This involves showing
that, for any physical quantity A, there is an arrow
$\breve{\delta}^o(A):\Sig\map\SR$, where $\SR$ is the quantity-value object for
this theory. The construction of $\breve{\delta}^o(A)$ is an extension of the
daseinisation of projection operators that was discussed in paper II. The
object $\SR$ is a monoid-object only in the topos, $\tau_\phi$, of the theory,
and to enhance the applicability of the formalism, we apply to $\SR$ a topos
analogue of the Grothendieck extension of a monoid to a group. The resulting
object, $\kSR$, is an abelian group-object in $\tau_\phi$. We also discuss
another candidate, $\PR{\mathR}$, for the quantity-value object. In this
presheaf, both inner and outer daseinisation are used in a symmetric way.
Finally, there is a brief discussion of the role of unitary operators in the
quantum topos scheme.

Categories of Systems</title><description>  This paper is the fourth in a series whose goal is to develop a fundamentally
new way of building theories of physics. The motivation comes from a desire to
address certain deep issues that arise in the quantum theory of gravity. Our
basic contention is that constructing a theory of physics is equivalent to
finding a representation in a topos of a certain formal language that is

this series are concerned with implementing this programme for a single system.
In the present paper, we turn to considering a collection of systems: in
particular, we are interested in the relation between the topos representation
for a composite system, and the representations for its constituents. We also
study this problem for the disjoint sum of two systems. Our approach to these
matters is to construct a category of systems and to find a topos
representation of the entire category.

phenomenon is sensitive to the initial conditions. One can expect the
resurrection of the original entanglement to occur in a periodic way following
each sudden death event. The length of the time interval for the zero
entanglement is dependent on not only the degree of entanglement of the initial

minimal size quantum circuit required to exactly implement a specified $%
\mathit{n}$-qubit unitary operation $U$, without the use of ancilla qubits?&quot;
Nielsen was able to prove that a lower bound on the minimal size circuit is
provided by the length of the geodesic between the identity $I$ and $U$, where
the length is defined by a suitable Finsler metric on $SU(2^{n})$. We prove
that the minimum circuit size that simulates $U$ is in linear relation with the
geodesic length and simulation parameters, for the given Finsler structure $F$.
As a corollary we prove the highest lower bound of $O(\frac{%
n^{4}}{p}d_{F_{p}}^{2}(I,U)L_{F_{p}}(I,\tilde{U})) $and the lowest upper bound
of $\Omega (n^{4}d_{F_{p}}^{3}(I,U))$, for the standard simulation technique.
Therefore, our results show that by standard simulation one can not expect a
better then $n^{2}$ times improvement in the upper bound over the result from
Nielsen, Dowling, Gu and Doherty \cite{Nielsen06}. Moreover, our equivalence
result can be applied to the arbitrary path on the manifold including the one
that is generated adiabatically.

says that, independent of the initial state, the system will tend to
equilibrate. In this work we study a setting where relaxation to a steady state
is exact, namely for the Bose-Hubbard model where the system is quenched from a
Mott quantum phase to the strong superfluid regime. We find that the evolving
state locally relaxes to a steady state with maximum entropy constrained by
second moments, maximizing the entanglement, to a state which is different from
the thermal state of the new Hamiltonian. Remarkably, in the infinite system
limit this relaxation is true for all large times, and no time average is
necessary. For large but finite system size we give a time interval for which
the system locally &quot;looks relaxed&quot; up to a prescribed error. Our argument
includes a central limit theorem for harmonic systems and exploits the finite
speed of sound. Additionally, we show that for all periodic initial
configurations, reminiscent of charge density waves, the system relaxes
locally. We sketch experimentally accessible signatures in optical lattices as
well as implications for the foundations of quantum statistical mechanics.

  Oscillators in a General Environment</title><description>  In this paper we derive an exact master equation for two coupled quantum
harmonic oscillators interacting via bilinear coupling with a common
environment at arbitrary temperature made up of many harmonic oscillators with
a general spectral density function. We first show a simple derivation based on
the observation that the two-harmonic oscillator model can be effectively
mapped into that of a single harmonic oscillator in a general environment plus
a free harmonic oscillator. Since the exact one harmonic oscillator master
equation is available [Hu, Paz and Zhang, Phys. Rev. D \textbf{45}, 2843
(1992)], the exact master equation with all its coefficients for this two
harmonic oscillator model can be easily deduced from the known results of the
single harmonic oscillator case. In the second part we give an influence
functional treatment of this model and provide explicit expressions for the
evolutionary operator of the reduced density matrix which are useful for the
study of decoherence and disentanglement issues. We show three applications of
this master equation: on the decoherence and disentanglement of two harmonic
oscillators due to their interaction with a common environment under Markovian
approximation, and a derivation of the uncertainty principle at finite
temperature for a composite object, modeled by two interacting harmonic
oscillators. The exact master equation for two, and its generalization to $N$,
harmonic oscillators interacting with a general environment are expected to be
useful for the analysis of quantum coherence, entanglement, fluctuations and
dissipation of mesoscopic objects towards the construction of a theoretical
framework for macroscopic quantum phenomena.

This expansion breaks rapidly down above threshold. This can be improved with
an alternative approach, not restricted to weak coupling: the Lindblad

Moreover, we also study how the number of collective excitations influences the
entanglement. It is shown that the larger the number of excitation is, the less

relativistic and non-relativistic $m$-partite multispinor bound entangled
states in Hilbert space of dimension $2^{m\lfloor d/2\rfloor}$, including the
bipartite Bell-type and iso-concurrence type states in the four-dimensional
space-time ($d=4$). By using the connection between Hilbert-Schmidt measure and
the optimal EWs associated with states, it is shown that as far as the spin
quantum correlations is concerned, the amount of entanglement is not a
relativistic scalar and has no invariant meaning. The introduced EWs are
manipulated via the linear programming (LP) which can be solved exactly by
using simplex method. The decomposability or non-decomposability of these EWs
is investigated, where the region of non-decomposable EWs of the first kind is
partially determined and it is shown that, all of the EWs of the second kind
are decomposable. These EWs have the preference that in the bipartite systems,
they can determine the region of separable states, i.e., bipartite
non-detectable density matrices of the same type as the EWs of the first kind
are necessarily separable. Also, multispinor EWs with non-polygon feasible
regions are provided, where the problem is solved by approximate LP, and in
contrary to the exactly manipulatable EWs, both the first and second kind of
the optimal approximate EWs can detect some bound entangled states.

that entanglement between field degrees of freedom inside and outside the

degrees of freedom far from the horizon contribute more significantly, and
deviations from the area law are observed. In other words, we demonstrate that

single photon source or an entangled photon source in quantum key distribution
(QKD). The triggering PDC QKD has already been studied in the literature. On
the other hand, a model and a post-processing protocol for the entanglement PDC
QKD are still missing. In this paper, we fill in this important gap by
proposing such a model and a post-processing protocol for the entanglement PDC
QKD. Although the PDC model is proposed to study the entanglement-based QKD, we
emphasize that our generic model may also be useful for other non-QKD
experiments involving a PDC source. Since an entangled PDC source is a basis
independent source, we apply Koashi-Preskill's security analysis to the
entanglement PDC QKD. We also investigate the entanglement PDC QKD with two-way
classical communications. We find that the recurrence scheme increases the key
rate and Gottesman-Lo protocol helps tolerate higher channel losses. By
simulating a recent 144km open-air PDC experiment, we compare three
implementations -- entanglement PDC QKD, triggering PDC QKD and coherent state
QKD. The simulation result suggests that the entanglement PDC QKD can tolerate
higher channel losses than the coherent state QKD. The coherent state QKD with
decoy states is able to achieve highest key rate in the low and medium-loss
regions. By applying Gottesman-Lo two-way post-processing protocol, the
entanglement PDC QKD can tolerate up to 70dB combined channel losses (35dB for
each channel) provided that the PDC source is placed in between Alice and Bob.
After considering statistical fluctuations, the PDC setup can tolerate up to
53dB channel losses.

  states and versus non-violation for separable states</title><description>  By introducing a quantitative `degree of commutativity' in terms of the angle
between spin-observables we present two tight quantitative trade-off relations
in the case of two qubits: First, for entangled states, between the degree of
commutativity of local observables and the maximal amount of violation of the
Bell inequality: if both local angles increase from zero to \pi/2 (i.e., the
degree of local commutativity decreases), the maximum violation of the Bell
inequality increases. Secondly, a converse trade-off relation holds for
separable states: if both local angles approach \pi/2 the maximal value
obtainable for the correlations in the Bell inequality decreases and thus the
non-violation increases. As expected, the extremes of these relations are found
in the case of anti-commuting local observables where respectively the bounds
of 2\sqrt{2} and \sqrt{2} hold for the expectation of the Bell operator. The
trade-off relations show that non-commmutativity gives ``a more than classical
result&quot; for entangled states, whereas &quot;a less than classical result&quot; is
obtained for separable states. The experimental relevance of the trade-off
relation for separable states is that it provides an experimental test for two
qubit entanglement. Its advantages are twofold: in comparison to violations of
Bell inequalities it is a stronger criterion and in comparison to entanglement
witnesses it needs to make less strong assumptions about the observables
implemented in the experiment.

high temperature. A simple mechanism, where system particles are randomly reset
to some standard initial state, can counteract the deteriorating effect of
decoherence, resulting in an entangled steady state far from thermodynamical
equilibrium. We present models for both gas-type systems and for strongly
coupled systems. We point out in which way the entanglement resulting from such
a reset mechanism is different from the entanglement that one can find in
thermal states. We develop master equations to describe the system and its
interaction with an environment, study toy models with two particles (qubits),
where the master equation can often be solved analytically, and finally examine
larger systems with possibly fluctuating particle numbers. We find that in
gas-type systems, the reset mechanism can produce an entangled steady state for
an arbitrary temperature of the environment, while this is not true in strongly
coupled systems. But even then, the temperature range where one can find
entangled steady states is typically much higher with the reset mechanism.

  for quantum complexity with noncommuting unitary queries</title><description>  Generalizing earlier work characterizing the quantum query complexity of
computing a function of an unknown classical ``black box'' function drawn from
some set of such black box functions, we investigate a more general quantum
query model in which the goal is to compute functions of N by N ``black box''
unitary matrices drawn from a set of such matrices, a problem with applications
to determining properties of quantum physical systems. We characterize the
existence of an algorithm for such a query problem, with given error and number
of queries, as equivalent to the feasibility of a certain set of semidefinite
programming constraints, or equivalently the infeasibility of a dual of these
constraints, which we construct. Relaxing the primal constraints to correspond
to mere pairwise near-orthogonality of the final states of a quantum computer,
conditional on black-box inputs having distinct function values, rather than
bounded-error determinability of the function value via a single measurement on
the output states, we obtain a relaxed primal program the feasibility of whose
dual still implies the nonexistence of a quantum algorithm. We use this to
obtain a generalization, to our not-necessarily-commutative setting, of the
``spectral adversary method'' for quantum query lower bounds.

scattering in an optical cavity [T. W. Chen, C. K. Law, P. T. Leung, Phys. Rev.
A {\bf 69} (2004) 063810]. This swapping operates limitedly in the strong

extend this scheme in cavity QED to present a more feasible and efficient
method for quantum memory combined with projective measurement. This method
works without requiring such a condition on the dipole couplings. The fidelity
is significantly higher than that of the swapping, and even in the moderate
coupling regime it reaches almost unity by narrowing sufficiently the
photon-pulse spectrum. This high performance is rather unaffected by the atomic
loss, cavity leakage or detunings, while a trade-off is paid in the success
probability for projective measurement.

We focus on such a BEC whose interatomic interaction strength is modulated
periodically by $\delta$-kicks which represents a realization of a kicked top.
In the (classical) mean-field approximation it provides a rich mixed phase
space dynamics with regular and chaotic regions. By increasing the
kick-strength a bifurcation leads to the appearance of self-trapping states
localized on regular islands. This self-trapping is also found for the many
particle system, however in general suppressed by coherent many particle
tunneling oscillations. The tunneling time can be calculated from the
quasi-energy splitting of the corresponding Floquet states. By varying the
kick-strength these quasi-energy levels undergo both avoided and even actual

such as pressure/volume, entropy/temperature, chemical potential/particle

number of such thermodynamic co-ordinates. We review the formulation of
thermodynamics and geometrical optics in terms of contact geometry. The
Lagrange bracket provides a generalization of canonical commutation relations.
Then we explore the quantization of this algebra by analogy to the quantization
of mechanics. The quantum contact algebra is associative, but the constant
functions are not represented by multiples of the identity: a reflection of the
classical fact that Lagrange brackets satisfy the Jacobi identity but not the
Leibnitz identity for derivations. We verify that this `quantization' describes
correctly the passage from geometrical to wave optics as well. As an example,
we work out the quantum contact geometry of odd-dimensional spheres.

field generated by collective scattering interferes destructively with the pump
driving the atoms. Hence atomic fluorescence is suppressed and cavity loss
becomes the dominant decay channel for the whole ensemble. Microscopically 3D
light-intensity minima are formed in the vicinity of the atoms that prevent
atomic excitation and form a regular lattice. The effect gets more pronounced
for large atom numbers, when the sum of the atomic decay rates exceeds the rate
of cavity losses and one would expect the opposite behaviour. These results

experience the same disturbance. The variation of rotations acting on
consecutive qubits is modeled as diffusion on the SU(2) group. The model may be
applied to spins traveling in a varying magnetic field, or to photons passing
through a fiber whose birefringence fluctuates over the time separation between
photons. We derive an explicit formula describing the action of the channel on
an arbitrary N-qubit state. For N=3 we investigate the effects of diffusion on
both classical and quantum capacity of the channel. We observe that
nonorthogonal states are necessary to achieve the optimal classical capacity.
Furthermore we find the threshold for the diffusion parameter above which
coherent information of the channel vanishes.

restricted to be linear but can also be multivariate polynomial functions of
higher degree.
  For a fixed number of indeterminates and bounded total degree the Hidden
Polynomial Function Graph Problem is hard on a classical computer as its black
box query complexity is polynomial in p. In contrast, this problem can be
reduced to a quantum state identification problem so that the resulting quantum
query complexity does not depend on p. For univariate polynomials we construct
a von Neumann measurement for distinguishing the states. We relate the success
probability and the implementation of this measurement to certain classical

hidden quadratic and cubic function graphs by establishing that the success
probability of the measurement is lower bounded by a constant and that it can

based on Weyl chamber steering, to CNOT gate design for inductively coupled
phase qubits with tunable coupling strength g. In the presence of simultaneous
rf pulses on the individual qubits that appropriately track the coupling
strength as it is varied, we show that an infinite family of switching
sequences preserving the time integral or &quot;area&quot; of g can be used to generate
CNOT logic. We demonstrate our approach by considering time-dependencies most
likely to be used in actual implementations: trapezoidal, sine, and soft
quartic (also known as Landau's hat).

reduced k-partite density operator of an n-partite symmetric state can be
approximated by a convex combination of k-fold product states. Variations of
this result include Renner's &quot;exponential&quot; approximation by &quot;almost-product&quot;
states, a theorem which deals with certain triples of representations of the
unitary group, and D'Cruz et al.'s result for infinite-dimensional systems. We
show how these theorems follow from a single, general de Finetti theorem for
representations of symmetry groups, each instance corresponding to a particular
choice of symmetry group and representation of that group. This gives some
insight into the nature of the set of approximating states, and leads to some
new results, including an exponential theorem for infinite-dimensional systems.

prime field can beat the Singleton bound. On the other hand, we show the
remarkable fact that there exist impure subsystem codes beating the Hamming

stabilizer and subsystem codes. One of the open problems suggested by Poulin's

Short version</title><description>  This article is the shorten version of quant-phys/0610106 with a supplemented
theory and new results concerning a single-electron laser driven by a
constant-potentiel battery. &quot;Quiet (or sub-Poissonian) oscillators generate a
number of dissipation events whose variance is less than the mean. It was shown
in 1984 by Golubev and Sokolov that lasers driven by regular pumps are quiet in
that sense. We consider in the present paper two oscillators that should
exhibit in principle the same property. First, a reflex klystron, a vacuum tube
operating in the microwave range of frequency. Second a laser involving a
single electron permanently interacting with the field. It is unnecessary to
quantize the optical field, that is, the theory is semi-classical, yet exact.
As an example, the battery-driven one-electron laser delivers a detected noise
of 7/8 of the shot-noise level, and is therefore sub-Poissonian. Our
calculations are related to resonance-fluorescence treatments but with a
different physical interpretation. Previous theories considering excited-state
atoms regularly-injected in low-loss resonators, on the other hand, do require
light quantization. The theory presented here is restricted to above-threshold
stationary single-mode oscillators. The paper is written in such a way that
readers should be able to follow it without having to refer to quantum-optics
texts.&quot;

dynamics in the lattice, and for strong particle-field coupling leads to a
quantum phase with only every second site occupied. We study the growth of this
new order out of a homogeneous initial distribution for few particles as the
microscopic physics underlying a quantum phase transition. Simulations reveal
that the growth dynamics crucially depends on the initial quantum many-body
state of the particles and can be monitored via the cavity fluorescence.
Studying the relaxation time of the ordering reveals inhibited tunnelling,
which indicates that the effective mass of the particles is increased by the
interaction with the cavity field. However, the relaxation becomes very quick

atom in a single mode high-Q cavity coupled to a zero temperature reservoir of
continuum external modes is determined from the atom-cavity mode master
equation using the quantum regression theorem. Initially the atom is in its
upper state and the cavity mode empty of photons. Following Glauber, the
spectrum is defined via the response of a detector atom. Spectra are calculated
for the detector located inside the cavity (case A), outside the cavity end
mirror (Case B-end emission), or placed for emission out the side of the cavity
(Case C). The spectra for case A and case B are found to be essentially the
same. In all the cases the predicted lineshapes are free of instrumental
effects and only due to cavity decay. Spectra are presented for intermediate
and strong coupling regime situations (where both atomic transitions are
resonant with the cavity frequency), for cases of non-zero cavity detuning, and
for cases where the two atomic transition frequencies differ. The spectral
features for Cases B(A) and C are qualitatively similar, with six spectral
peaks for resonance cases and eight for detuned cases. These general features
of the spectra can be understood via the dressed atom model. However, Case B
and C spectra differ in detail, with the latter exhibiting a deep spectral hole
at the cavity frequency due to quantum interference effects.

appearing beyond the regime of validity of the Proximity Force Approximation
(PFA). Quantitative evaluations can be obtained by using scattering theory in a
perturbative expansion valid when the corrugation amplitudes are smaller than
the three other length scales: the mean separation distance $L$ of the plates,
the corrugation period $\lambda_\C$ and the plasma wavelength $\lambda_\P$.
Within this perturbative expansion, evaluations are obtained for arbitrary
relative values of $L$, $\lambda_\C$ and $\lambda_\P$ while limiting cases,
some of them already known, are recovered when these values obey some specific
orderings. The consequence of these results for comparison with existing

given spectrum of a joint state of a composite quantum system. This setting,
also referred to as the question of the compatibility of local spectra, has
several applications in quantum information theory. Here, we introduce the
analogue of this statement for Gaussian states for any number of modes, and
solve it in generality, for pure and mixed states, both concerning necessary
and sufficient conditions. Formally, our result can be viewed as an analogue of
the Sing-Thompson Theorem (respectively Horn's Lemma), characterizing the
relationship between main diagonal elements and singular values of a complex
matrix: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for vectors (d1, ..., dn)
and (c1, ..., cn) to be the symplectic eigenvalues and symplectic main diagonal
elements of a strictly positive real matrix, respectively. More physically
speaking, this result determines what local temperatures or entropies are
consistent with a pure or mixed Gaussian state of several modes. We find that
this result implies a solution to the problem of sharing of entanglement in
pure Gaussian states and allows for estimating the global entropy of
non-Gaussian states based on local measurements. Implications to the actual
preparation of multi-mode continuous-variable entangled states are discussed.
We compare the findings with the marginal problem for qubits, the solution of
which for pure states has a strikingly similar and in fact simple form.

  dynamics in a quantum dot</title><description>  Control of electron spin decoherence in contact with a mesoscopic bath of
many interacting nuclear spins in an InAs quantum dot is studied by solving the
coupled quantum dynamics. The nuclear spin bath, because of its bifurcated
evolution predicated on the electron spin up or down state, measures the
which-state information of the electron spin and hence diminishes its
coherence. The many-body dynamics of nuclear spin bath is solved with a
pair-correlation approximation. In the relevant timescale, nuclear pair-wise
flip-flops, as elementary excitations in the mesoscopic bath, can be mapped
into the precession of non-interacting pseudo-spins. Such mapping provides a
geometrical picture for understanding the decoherence and for devising control
schemes. A close examination of nuclear bath dynamics reveals a wealth of
phenomena and new possibilities of controlling the electron spin decoherence.
For example, when the electron spin is flipped by a $\pi$-pulse at $\tau$, its
coherence will partially recover at $\sqrt{2}\tau$ as a consequence of quantum
disentanglement from the mesoscopic bath. In contrast to the re-focusing of
inhomogeneously broadened phases by conventional spin-echoes, the
disentanglement is realized through shepherding quantum evolution of the bath
state via control of the quantum object. A concatenated construction of pulse
sequences can eliminate the decoherence with arbitrary accuracy, with the
nuclear-nuclear spin interaction strength acting as the controlling small
parameter.

  The Modified BCHSH Inequalities</title><description>  Most physicists uphold that the tests of the Bell inequalities (BI) performed
up to now confirm the predictions of standard quantum mechanics (SQM) and
refute local realism. But some scholars criticize this conviction, defending
local realism in various ways. We present here a new viewpoint based on an
improved version of the extended semantic realism (ESR) model that has been
recently worked out by one of the authors. The ESR model embodies the
mathematical formalism of SQM into a more general framework in which not only
local realism but also objectivity of physical properties holds, and the
probabilities of SQM are reinterpreted as conditional instead of absolute.
Hence the ESR model provides some predictions that are formally identical to
those of SQM but have a different physical interpretation, and further
predictions that differ also formally from those of SQM. In particular, we show
here that the BI introduced by Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (BCHSH
inequalities) must be replaced by modified BCHSH inequalities. These depend on
detection probabilities which may be such that the new inequalities are never
violated by the conditional expectation values predicted by the model. The
condition that no violation occurs implies the existence of upper bounds on
detection probabilities, which makes the ESR model falsifiable. These results
admit an intuitive explanation in terms of unfair sampling but basically differ
from the seemingly similar results obtained by other approaches in which the
efficiency problem is discussed in order to vindicate some kind of local
realism.

single electron transistor (SET) in the framework of exactly solvable model.
The SET plays a role of the fluctuating environment affecting the qubit's
parameters in a controllable way. We derive the rate equations describing
dynamics of the entire system for both weak and strong qubit-SET coupling.
Solving these equation we obtain decoherence and relaxation rates of the qubit,
as well as the spectral density of the fluctuating qubit's parameters. We found
that in the weak coupling regime the decoherence and relaxation rates are
directly related to the spectral density taken at Rabi or at zero frequency,
depending on what a particular qubit's parameters is fluctuating. This relation
holds also in the presence of weak back-action of the qubit on the fluctuating
environment. In the case of strong back-action, such simple relationship no
longer holds, even if the qubit-SET coupling is small. It does not hold either
in the strong-coupling regime, even in the absence of the back-action. In
addition, we found that our model predicts localization of the qubit in the

performed for a deep silica-induced potential allowing for a large number of
bound levels as well as free states of a cesium atom. The total absorption rate
is shown to be determined mainly by the bound-to-bound transitions for deep

Moreover, the phonon emission and absorption processes can be orders of

We also study various types of transitions from free states. We show that, for
thermal atomic cesium with temperature in the range from 100 $\mu$K to 400

spectra of relativistic spin-1/2 and spin-0 particles in the presence of vector

both scalar and vector potentials are spherical, these conditions for
isospectrality imply that the spin-orbit and Darwin terms of either the upper

equivalent, as far as energy is concerned, to a spin-0 state. In this case,
besides energy, a scalar particle will also have the same orbital angular

or correlated with either of the two entangled qubits and is never entangled,
but becomes correlated, with the system of those two qubits. The two entangled
qubits do not interact, but their state can change from maximally entangled to
separable or from separable to maximally entangled. Similar changes for the two

then there are compensating changes of entanglement that involve the control.
When the entanglement increases, the map that describes the change of the state
of the two entangled qubits is not completely positive. Combination of two

the tripartite entanglement of three qubits (2-state systems), where the common

of seven qubits where the common symmetry is E_7 which contains [SL(2)]^7. Here
we present another example: N=8 black holes (or black strings) in five

where the common symmetry is E_6 which contains [SL(3)]^3. Both the black hole
(or black string) entropy and the entanglement measure are provided by the
Cartan cubic E_6 invariant. Similar analogies exist for ``magic'' N=2

is possible to generate efficiently superpositions of components for which only
one mode is populated, commonly called ``N00N states''. For the basic
procedure, sources of number states leak onto a beam splitter, and the output
ports are monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction
of the input at one output port suffices to direct the remainder to the same
port with high probability, however large the initial state. When instead
photons are detected at both ports, Schr\&quot;{o}dinger cat states are produced. We
describe a circuit for making the components of such a state orthogonal, and
another for subsequent conversion to a N00N state. Our approach scales
exponentially better than existing proposals. Important applications include
quantum imaging and metrology.

state, i.e. a state in which the properties of the global system are well
defined but the properties of each subsystem are not. Entanglement is at the
heart of quantum physics, both for its conceptual foundations and for
applications in information processing and quantum communication. Remarkably,
entanglement can be &quot;swapped&quot;: if one prepares two independent entangled pairs
A1-A2 and B1-B2, a joint measurement on A1 and B1 (called a &quot;Bell-State
Measurement&quot;, BSM) has the effect of projecting A2 and B2 onto an entangled
state, although these two particles have never interacted or shared any common
past[1,2]. Experiments using twin photons produced by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion (SPDC) have already demonstrated entanglement swapping[3-6],
but here we present its first realization using continuous wave (CW) sources,
as originally proposed[2]. The challenge was to achieve sufficiently sharp
synchronization of the photons in the BSM. Using narrow-band filters, the
coherence time of the photons that undergo the BSM is significantly increased,
exceeding the temporal resolution of the detectors. Hence pulsed sources can be
replaced by CW sources, which do not require any synchronization[6,7], allowing
for the first time the use of completely autonomous sources. Our experiment
exploits recent progress in the time precision of photon detectors, in the
efficiency of photon pair production by SPDC with waveguides in nonlinear
crystals[8], and in the stability of narrow-band filters. This approach is
independent of the form of entanglement; we employed time-bin entangled
photons[9] at telecom wavelengths. Our setup is robust against thermal or
mechanical fluctuations in optical fibres thanks to cm-long coherence lengths.

dramatically change the tunneling behavior. We predict that in general the
tunneling process becomes quasiperiodic. In a certain regime of parameters a
collapse and revival of the tunneling occurs. Accessing the internal degrees of

nonlocal de Broglie-Bohm trajectory prescription for an entangled singlet state
of massive particles. After reviewing various meanings of the term
``nonlocal'', we show that by using appropriately retarded wavefunctions (i.e.,
the locality loophole) this local model can violate Bell's inequality, without
making any appeal to detector inefficiencies.
  We analyze a possible experimental configuration appropriate to massive
two-particle singlet wavefunctions and find that as long as the particles are
not ultra-relativistic, a locality loophole exists and Dirac wave(s) can
propagate from Alice or Bob's changing magnetic field, through space, to the
other detector, arriving before the particle and thereby allowing a local
interpretation to the 2-particle de Broglie-Bohm trajectories.
  We also propose a physical effect due to changing magnetic fields in a
Stern-Gerlach EPR setup that will throw away events and create a detector
loophole in otherwise perfectly efficient detectors, an effect that is only
significant for near-luminal particles that might otherwise close the locality
loophole.

  noise</title><description>  We introduce a density tensor hierarchy for open system dynamics, that
recovers information about fluctuations lost in passing to the reduced density
matrix. For the case of fluctuations arising from a classical probability
distribution, the hierarchy is formed from expectations of products of pure
state density matrix elements, and can be compactly summarized by a simple
generating function. For the case of quantum fluctuations arising when a
quantum system interacts with a quantum environment in an overall pure state,
the corresponding hierarchy is defined as the environmental trace of products
of system matrix elements of the full density matrix. Only the lowest member of
the quantum noise hierarchy is directly experimentally measurable. The unit
trace and idempotence properties of the pure state density matrix imply descent
relations for the tensor hierarchies, that relate the order $n$ tensor, under
contraction of appropriate pairs of tensor indices, to the order $n-1$ tensor.
As examples to illustrate the classical probability distribution formalism, we
consider a quantum system evolving by It\^o stochastic and by jump process
Schr\&quot;odinger equations. As examples to illustrate the corresponding trace
formalism in the quantum fluctuation case, we consider collisional Brownian
motion of an infinite mass Brownian particle, and the weak coupling Born-Markov
master equation. In different specializations, the latter gives the hierarchies
generalizing the quantum optical master equation and the Caldeira--Leggett
master equation. As a further application of the density tensor, we contrast
stochastic Schr\&quot;odinger equations that reduce and that do not reduce the state
vector, and discuss why a quantum system coupled to a quantum environment
behaves like the latter.

entanglement to arrange for correlations among their bids, with the assurance
that this entanglement is not observable by others. The protocol is useful for
information hiding applications, such as partnership bidding with allocative
externality or concerns about revealing bidding preferences. The protocol
applies to a variety of auction types, e.g., first or second price, and to
auctions involving either a single item or arbitrary bundles of items (i.e.,
combinatorial auctions). We analyze the game-theoretical behavior of the

origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the

Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average

The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface

states of the external trapping potential. Our analysis is extended to
quasi-one-dimensional geometries, when the scattering exhibit
confinement-induced resonances, similar to the ones studied before for
short-range interactions. For quasi-one-dimensional systems we investigate the
effects of coupling between the center of mass and relative motion, which
occurs for different trapping frequencies of atom and ion traps. Finally, we
show how the two types of resonances can be employed for quantum state control
and spectroscopy of atom-ion molecules.

  Problems</title><description>  We review recent results obtained in the physics of the thermal Casimir force
acting between two dielectrics, dielectric and metal, and between metal and
semiconductor. The detailed derivation for the low-temperature behavior of the
Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy in the configuration of two real
dielectric plates is presented. For dielectrics with finite static dielectric
permittivity it is shown that the Nernst heat theorem is satisfied. Hence, the
Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces is demonstrated to be
consistent with thermodynamics. The nonzero dc conductivity of dielectric
plates is proved to lead to a violation of the Nernst heat theorem and, thus,
is not related to the phenomenon of dispersion forces. The low-temperature
asymptotics of the Casimir free energy, pressure and entropy are derived also
in the configuration of one metal and one dielectric plate. The results are
shown to be consistent with thermodynamics if the dielectric plate possesses a
finite static dielectric permittivity. If the dc conductivity of a dielectric
plate is taken into account this results in the violation of the Nernst heat
theorem. We discuss both the experimental and theoretical results related to
the Casimir interaction between metal and semiconductor with different charge
carrier density. Discussions in the literature on the possible influence of
spatial dispersion on the thermal Casimir force are analyzed. In conclusion,
the conventional Lifshitz theory taking into account only the frequency
dispersion remains the reliable foundation for the interpretation of all
present experiments.

realistic values of photon loss are considered its fidelity is significantly

as a new approach to quantum computation where the notion of measurement is the
main driving force of computation. This is in contrast with the more
traditional circuit model which is based on unitary operations. Among
measurement-based quantum computation methods, the recently introduced one-way
quantum computer stands out as fundamental.
  We develop a rigorous mathematical model underlying the one-way quantum
computer and present a concrete syntax and operational semantics for programs,
which we call patterns, and an algebra of these patterns derived from a
denotational semantics. More importantly, we present a calculus for reasoning
locally and compositionally about these patterns.
  We present a rewrite theory and prove a general standardization theorem which
allows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form.
Standardization has far-reaching consequences: a new physical architecture
based on performing all the entanglement in the beginning, parallelization by
exposing the dependency structure of measurements and expressiveness theorems.
  Furthermore we formalize several other measurement-based models:
Teleportation, Phase and Pauli models and present compositional embeddings of
them into and from the one-way model. This allows us to transfer all the theory
we develop for the one-way model to these models. This shows that the framework
we have developed has a general impact on measurement-based computation and is
not just particular to the one-way quantum computer.

universal adiabatic quantum computation. However, the 2-local model
Hamiltonians used in these proofs are general and hence do not limit the types
of interactions required between spins. To address this concern, the present
paper provides two simple model Hamiltonians that are of practical interest to
experimentalists working towards the realization of a universal adiabatic
quantum computer. The model Hamiltonians presented are the simplest known
QMA-complete 2-local Hamiltonians. The 2-local Ising model with 1-local
transverse field which has been realized using an array of technologies, is
perhaps the simplest quantum spin model but is unlikely to be universal for
adiabatic quantum computation. We demonstrate that this model can be rendered
universal and QMA-complete by adding a tunable 2-local transverse XX coupling.
We also show the universality and QMA-completeness of spin models with only
1-local Z and X fields and 2-local ZX interactions.

Hamiltonian dynamical system on the space of quantum pure states, the
projective Hilbert space $P {\cal H}$. Separable states of a bipartite quantum
system form a special submanifold of $P {\cal H}$.
  We analyze the Hamiltonian dynamics that corresponds to the quantum system
constrained on the manifold of separable states, using as an important example
the system of two interacting qubits. The constraints introduce nonlinearities
which render the dynamics nontrivial. We show that the qualitative properties
of the constrained dynamics clearly manifest the symmetry of the qubits system.
In particular, if the quantum Hamilton's operator has not enough symmetry, the
constrained dynamics is nonintegrable, and displays the typical features of a
Hamiltonian dynamical system with mixed phase space. Possible physical
realizations of the separability constraints are discussed.

  Entanglement of Multi-Qubit Heisenberg {\it XY} Chains</title><description>  It has been shown that, for the two-qubit Heisenberg XY model, anisotropy and
magnetic field may together be used to produce entanglement for any finite
temperature by adjusting the external magnetic field beyond some finite
critical strength. This interesting result arises from an analysis employing
the Wootters concurrence, a computable measure of entanglement for two-qubit
states. Recently, Mintert {\em et al.} proposed generalizations of Wootters
concurrence for multipartite states. These MKB concurrences possess a
mathematical property that enables one to understand the origin of this
characteristic behavior. Here, we first study the effect of anisotropy and
magnetic field on the multipartite thermal entanglement of a four-qubit
Heisenberg XY chain using the MKB concurrences. We show that this model
exhibits characteristic behavior similar to that of the two-qubit model. In
addition, we show that this can again be understood using the same mathematical
property. Next, we show that the six-qubit Heisenberg XY chain possesses
properties necessary for it to have the characteristic behavior too. Most
importantly, it is possible to directly measure the multipartite MKB
concurrences of pure states. This may provide an experimental verification of
our conjecture that for a Heisenberg XY chain of any even number of qubits, it
is always possible to obtain non-zero genuine multipartite entanglement at any
finite temperature by applying a sufficiently large magnetic field.

error, and two for a general noise model. The protocol works with such scarce
local resources by never post-selecting on the measurement outcomes of
purification rounds. We find that such a strategy causes fidelity to follow a

photon state involving several degrees of freedom is represented in a new
expression based on the permutation symmetry of bosons. In this expression,
each degree of freedom of a single photon is regarded as a qubit and operations
on photons as qubit gates. The two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel interference is well
interpreted with it. Moreover, the analysis reveals the entanglement between
different degrees of freedom in a four-photon state from parametric down
conversion, even if there is no entanglement between them in the two-photon
state. The entanglement will decrease the state purity and photon interference
visibility in the experiments on a four-photon polarization state.

perturbation is investigated. While the Floquet operator of the map and its
spectrum have a common period with respect to the perturbation strength
$\lambda$, we show an example in which none of the quasienergies nor the
eigenvectors obey the same period: After a periodic increment of $\lambda$, the
quasienergy arrives at the nearest higher one, instead of the initial one,
exhibiting an anholonomy, which governs another anholonomy of the eigenvectors.
An application to quantum state manipulations is outlined.

  based on the mixed convex roof</title><description>  New measures of multipartite entanglement are constructed based on two
definitions of multipartite information and different methods of optimizing
over extensions of the states. One is a generalization of the squashed
entanglement where one takes the mutual information of parties conditioned on
the state's extension and takes the infimum over such extensions. Additivity of
the multipartite squashed entanglement is proved for both versions of the
multipartite information which turn out to be related. The second one is based
on taking classical extensions. This scheme is generalized, which enables to
construct measures of entanglement based on the {\it mixed convex roof} of a
quantity, which in contrast to the standard convex roof method involves
optimization over all decompositions of a density matrix rather than just the
decompositions into pure states. As one of the possible applications of these
results we prove that any multipartite monotone is an upper bound on the amount
of multipartite distillable key. The findings are finally related to analogous
results in classical key agreement.

Jancovici, 2007 {\it J. Stat. Mech.} P02002]; for a nearly classical quantum
fluid in a half-space bounded by a plain plane hard wall (no image forces), we
had generalized the Wigner-Kirkwood expansion of the equilibrium statistical
quantities in powers of Planck's constant $\hbar$. As a model system for a more
detailed study, we consider the quantum two-dimensional one-component plasma: a
system of charged particles of one species, interacting through the logarithmic
Coulomb potential in two dimensions, in a uniformly charged background of
opposite sign, such that the total charge vanishes. The corresponding classical
system is exactly solvable in a variety of geometries, including the present
one of a half-plane, when $\beta e^2=2$, where $\beta$ is the inverse
temperature and $e$ is the charge of a particle: all the classical $n$-body
densities are known. For the quantum one-component plasma, two sum rules
involving the truncated two-body density (and, for one of them, the density
profile) have been derived, a long time ago, by heuristic macroscopic
arguments: one sum rule is about the asymptotic form along the wall of the
truncated two-body density, the other one is about the dipole moment of the
structure factor. In the two-dimensional case at $\beta e^2=2$, we have now
explicit expressions up to order $\hbar^2$ of these two quantum densities, thus
we can microscopically check the sum rules at this order. The checks are
positive, reinforcing the idea that the sum rules are correct.

provides a stiffer trap for the oscillating mirror. Furthermore it prevents
bistability from limiting the use of higher laser powers for mirror trapping,

isolation of the mirror from classical noise so that its dynamics are perturbed
mostly by the vacuum fluctuations of the optical fields. These improvements are
expected to bring the task of achieving ground state occupation for the mirror

entanglement and the time it takes for the entanglement to reach its optimum
value is a sensitive function the initial conditions and the position of the
atoms inside the cavity mode. It is found that the entangled properties of the
two atoms can readily be extracted from dynamics of a simple two-level system.
Effectively, we engineer two coupled qubits whose the dynamics are analogous to
that of a driven single two-level system. It is found that spatial variations
of the coupling constants actually help to create transient entanglement which
may appear on the time scale much longer than that predicted for the case of
equal coupling constants. When the atoms are initially prepared in an entangled
state, they may remain entangled for all times. We also find that the
entanglement exhibits an interesting phenomenon of diffraction when the the
atoms are located between the nodes and antinodes of the cavity mode. The
diffraction pattern of the entanglement varies with time and we explain this
effect in terms of the quantum property of complementarity, which is manifested
as a tradeoff between the knowledge of energy of the exchanged photon versus
the evolution time of the system.

according to which an external reality exists independent of observation. But
quantum physics has shattered some of our cornerstone beliefs. According to
Bell's theorem, any theory that is based on the joint assumption of realism and
locality (meaning that local events cannot be affected by actions in space-like
separated regions) is at variance with certain quantum predictions. Experiments
with entangled pairs of particles have amply confirmed these quantum
predictions, thus rendering local realistic theories untenable. Maintaining
realism as a fundamental concept would therefore necessitate the introduction
of 'spooky' actions that defy locality. Here we show by both theory and
experiment that a broad and rather reasonable class of such non-local realistic
theories is incompatible with experimentally observable quantum correlations.
In the experiment, we measure previously untested correlations between two
entangled photons, and show that these correlations violate an inequality
proposed by Leggett for non-local realistic theories. Our result suggests that
giving up the concept of locality is not sufficient to be consistent with
quantum experiments, unless certain intuitive features of realism are
abandoned.

invariant measures of the classical system, the so called quantum limits, and
one would like to understand which invariant measures can occur that way,
thereby classifying the semiclassical behaviour of eigenfunctions. We introduce

examples of non-ergodic maps where arbitrary convex combinations of absolutely

the squeezing properties of the light, is insensitive to linear losses, and has
potential applications. In this paper we describe analytically this behavior
for travelling-wave down-conversion with continuous or pulsed pumping, both for
high- and low-power regimes. For this we derive a quantum-mechanical expression
for the down-converted amplitude generated by an arbitrary pump, and formulate
operators that represent various two-photon interactions induced by broadband
light. This model is in excellent agreement with experimental results of TPA

value of one-round games played by a verifier and a team of provers who can
share quantum entanglement. In particular, we show that it is NP-hard to
approximate within an inverse polynomial the value of a one-round game with (i)
quantum verifier and two entangled provers or (ii) classical verifier and three
entangled provers. Previously it was not even known if computing the value
exactly is NP-hard. We also describe a mathematical conjecture, which, if true,
would imply hardness of approximation to within a constant.
  We start our proof by describing two ways to modify classical multi-prover
games to make them resistant to entangled provers. We then show that a strategy
for the modified game that uses entanglement can be ``rounded'' to one that
does not. The results then follow from classical inapproximability bounds. Our
work implies that, unless P=NP, the values of entangled-prover games cannot be
computed by semidefinite programs that are polynomial in the size of the
verifier's system, a method that has been successful for more restricted
quantum games.

motion. An initially nonlocal quantum state leaves a record whose redundancy
increases rapidly with its spatial extent. Significant delocalization (e.g., a
Schroedinger's Cat state) causes high redundancy: many observers can measure

  temperature</title><description>  We calculate exactly the von Neumann and topological entropies of the toric
code as a function of system size and temperature. We do so for systems with
infinite energy scale separation between magnetic and electric excitations, so
that the magnetic closed loop structure is fully preserved while the electric
loop structure is tampered with by thermally excited electric charges. We find
that the entanglement entropy is a singular function of temperature and system
size, and that the limit of zero temperature and the limit of infinite system
size do not commute. From the entanglement entropy we obtain the topological
entropy, which is shown to drop to half its zero-temperature value for any
infinitesimal temperature in the thermodynamic limit, and remains constant as
the temperature is further increased. Such discontinuous behavior is replaced
by a smooth decreasing function in finite-size systems. If the separation of
energy scales in the system is large but finite, we argue that our results hold
at small enough temperature and finite system size, and a second drop in the
topological entropy should occur as the temperature is raised so as to disrupt
the magnetic loop structure by allowing the appearance of free magnetic
charges. We interpret our results as an indication that the underlying magnetic
and electric closed loop structures contribute equally to the topological
entropy (and therefore to the topological order) in the system. Since each loop
structure \emph{per se} is a classical object, we interpret the quantum
topological order in our system as arising from the ability of the two
structures to be superimposed and appear simultaneously.

  Strong Pi Pulses</title><description>  In spectroscopy, it is conventional to treat pulses much stronger than the
linewidth as delta-functions. In NMR, this assumption leads to the prediction
that pi pulses do not refocus the dipolar coupling. However, NMR spin echo
measurements in dipolar solids defy these conventional expectations when more
than one pi pulse is used. Observed effects include a long tail in the CPMG
echo train for short delays between pi pulses, an even-odd asymmetry in the
echo amplitudes for long delays, an unusual fingerprint pattern for
intermediate delays, and a strong sensitivity to pi-pulse phase. Experiments
that set limits on possible extrinsic causes for the phenomena are reported. We
find that the action of the system's internal Hamiltonian during any real pulse
is sufficient to cause the effects. Exact numerical calculations, combined with
average Hamiltonian theory, identify novel terms that are sensitive to
parameters such as pulse phase, dipolar coupling, and system size.
Visualization of the entire density matrix shows a unique flow of quantum
coherence from non-observable to observable channels when applying repeated pi
pulses.

interesting alternative to the well-studied &quot;straight line&quot; adiabatic

prepare three types of states: Kitaev's toric code state, the cluster state of
the measurement-based computation model and the history state used in the
adiabatic simulation of quantum circuit. We also show that the method, when
adapted for quantum search, provides quadratic speedup as other optimal methods
do with the advantages that the problem Hamiltonian is time-independent and
that the energy gap above the ground state is strictly nondecreasing with time.
Likewise the method can be used for optimization as an alternative to the usual
adiabatic algorithm.

Conversely, in the absence of a quantum dot electron, the lifetime of nuclear

The balance region of parameters is divided into a phase-continuing region and

Due to the velocity singularities of vortex cores and the blowing-up of

information paradox. Further, there seems to be no unique prediction of where
the information about the collapsing body is localized. We propose that the
latter aspect of the paradox may be a manifestation of an inconsistent
self-reference in the semiclassical theory of black hole evolution. This
suggests the inadequacy of the semiclassical approach or, at worst, that
standard quantum mechanics and general relavity are fundamentally incompatible.
One option for the resolution for the paradox in the localization is to
identify the G\&quot;odel-like incompleteness that corresponds to an imposition of
consistency, and introduce possibly new physics that supplies this
incompleteness. Another option is to modify the theory in such a way as to
prohibit self-reference. We discuss various possible scenarios to implement
these options, including eternally collapsing objects, black hole remnants,
black hole final states, and simple variants of semiclassical quantum gravity.

While differences in classical states are easy to detect, quantum states, which

to several notions of equivalence. This provides flexibility in optimizing
quantum circuits, but leads to difficult new equivalence-checking issues for

the modification term can both be observed in successive projective
measurements. The complex modification term is a measure of measurement
disturbance. A selective phase rotation is needed to obtain the imaginary part.
This leads to a complex quasiprobability, the Kirkwood distribution. We show
that the Kirkwood distribution contains full information about the state if the
two observables are maximal and complementary. The Kirkwood distribution gives
a new picture of state reduction. In a nonselective measurement, the
modification term vanishes. A selective measurement leads to a quantum state as
a nonnegative conditional probability. We demonstrate the special significance

exposed to environment, decoheres at a rate scaling with the separation of its
component states in phase space. This is more or less consistent with the well
known proposition that a more macroscopic quantum state is reduced more quickly
to a classical state in general. Effects of initial mixedness, however, on the
subsequent decoherence of MQSs have been less known. In this paper, we study
the evolution of a highly mixed MQS interacting with an environment, and
compare it with that of a pure MQS having the same size of the central distance
between its component states. Although the decoherence develops more rapidly
for the mixed MQS in short times, its rate can be significantly suppressed
after a certain time and becomes smaller than the decoherence rate of its
corresponding pure MQS. In an optics experiment to generate a MQS, our result
has a practical implication that nonclassicality of a MQS can be still
observable in moderate times even though a large amount of noise is added to
the initial state.

$\ket{\psi}\longrightarrow\ket{\phi}$ of a bipartite entangled state by a
separable operation. If the separable operation is a local operation with
classical communication (LOCC), Nielsen's majorization theorem provides
necessary and sufficient conditions. For the general case we derive a necessary
condition in terms of products of Schmidt coefficients, which is equivalent to
the Nielsen condition when either of the two factor spaces is of dimension 2,
but is otherwise weaker. One implication is that no separable operation can
reverse a deterministic map produced by another separable operation, if one
excludes the case where the Schmidt coefficients of $\ket{\psi}$ and are the
same as those of $\ket{\phi}$. The question of sufficient conditions in the
general separable case remains open. When the Schmidt coefficients of
$\ket{\psi}$ are the same as those of $\ket{\phi}$, we show that the Kraus
operators of the separable transformation restricted to the supports of
$\ket{\psi}$ on the factor spaces are proportional to unitaries. When that
proportionality holds and the factor spaces have equal dimension, we find
conditions for the deterministic transformation of a collection of several full
Schmidt rank pure states $\ket{\psi_j}$ to pure states $\ket{\phi_j}$.

Here we give efficient syntheses of various unitary transformations on Ising

existence of a relation between arrangement of spins and entanglement, in which
the DM coupling plays an essential role. It suggests also that anisotropic

operations. We first present a necessary and sufficient condition for a finite
set of orthogonal quantum states to be distinguishable by separable operations.
An analytical version of this condition is derived for the case of $(D-1)$ pure
states, where $D$ is the total dimension of the state space under
consideration. A number of interesting consequences of this result are then
carefully investigated. Remarkably, we show there exists a large class of
$2\otimes 2$ separable operations not being realizable by local operations and
classical communication. Before our work only a class of $3\otimes 3$ nonlocal
separable operations was known [Bennett et al, Phys. Rev. A \textbf{59}, 1070
(1999)]. We also show that any basis of the orthogonal complement of a
multipartite pure state is indistinguishable by separable operations if and
only if this state cannot be a superposition of 1 or 2 orthogonal product
states, i.e., has an orthogonal Schmidt number not less than 3, thus generalize
the recent work about indistinguishable bipartite subspaces [Watrous, Phys.
Rev. Lett. \textbf{95}, 080505 (2005)]. Notably, we obtain an explicit
construction of indistinguishable subspaces of dimension 7 (or 6) by
considering a composite quantum system consisting of two qutrits (resp. three
qubits), which is slightly better than the previously known indistinguishable
bipartite subspace with dimension 8.

Electric and magnetic polarization densities of the medium are defined in terms

assuming a 1D attractive zero-range odd-wave interaction induced by a 3D p-wave
Feshbach resonance, as well as the usual repulsive zero-range even-wave
interaction stemming from 3D s-wave scattering. The calculations are based on
the exact mapping from the SFG to a ``Lieb-Liniger-Heisenberg'' model with
delta-function repulsions depending on isotropic Heisenberg spin-spin
interactions, and indicate that the SFG should be stable against three-body
recombination in a large region of the coupling constant plane encompassing
parts of both the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. However, the
limiting case of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas (FTG), a spin-aligned 1D
Fermi gas with infinitely attractive p-wave interactions, is unstable in this

there is no localization below a threshold value for the strength of

atoms. In a full quantum treatment, however, we find that localized states
exist for arbitrarily weak attractive or repulsive interactions for any number

two-particle bound state and an appropriate measure of entanglement, that the
entanglement tends to a finite value in the limit of weak interactions. Coupled
with the non-existence of localization in an optimized quantum product state,
we conclude that the localization exists by virtue of entanglement.

multilevel quantum system (with many degrees of freedom) interacting with
multi-bath reservoir and driven by ac fields. In this approach, the system is
described by a reduced density operator and the multi-bath reservoir is
characterized by a number of spectral densities. The reduced density operator
is governed by the master equation in which the effect of ac driving fields and
the leakage to non-computational states are included. The theory is applied to
the study of decoherence of a two-dimensional (2D) SQUID flux qubit coupled to
control and readout circuits. The predicted results are in very good agreement
with available experimental results in the absence of driving fields and with
the analytic results of a dissipative two-level system in the presence of weak
driving fields. The relaxation and decoherence times versus the parameters and
temperature of the control and readout circuits are also explored in details to
facilitate the optimization of the 2D SQUID qubit.

Fisher information of a one-parameter quantum channel. They showed that for
quasi-classical models their bound is achievable and they gave a necessary and
sufficient condition for positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) attaining
this bound. They asked (i) whether their bound is attainable more generally,
(ii) whether explicit expressions for optimal POVMs can be derived from the
attainability condition. We show that the symmetric logarithmic derivative
(SLD) quantum information is less than or equal to the SM bound, i.e.\
$H(\theta) \leq C_{\Upsilon}(\theta)$ and we find conditions for equality. As
the Fisher information is less than or equal to the SLD quantum information,
i.e. $F_M(\theta) \leq H(\theta)$, we can deduce when equality holds in
$F_M(\theta) \leq C_{\Upsilon}(\theta)$. Equality does not hold for all
channels. As a consequence, the attainability condition cannot be used to test
for optimal POVMs for all channels. These results are extended to
multi-parameter channels.

For pure Gaussian states, central resources for continuous-variable quantum

additional constraint of global purity, and the one following by the
local-unitary freedom. Counting arguments and insights from the phase-space
Schmidt decomposition and in general from the framework of symplectic analysis,
accompany our description of the standard form of pure n-mode Gaussian states.
In particular we clarify why only in pure states with n&lt;=3 modes all the direct
correlations between position and momentum operators can be set to zero by
local unitary operations. For any n, the emerging minimal set of parametres
contains complete information about all forms of entanglement in the
corresponding states. An efficient state engineering scheme (able to encode
direct correlations between position and momentum operators as well) is
proposed to produce entangled multimode Gaussian resources, its number of
optical elements matching the minimal number of locally invariant degrees of

qubits is essential for future implementations of large-scale quantum
communication and measurement-based quantum computation. Both steps have been
achieved separately in many proof-of-principle experiments, but the
demonstration of memory-built-in teleportation of photonic qubits remains an
experimental challenge. Here, we demonstrate teleportation between photonic
(flying) and atomic (stationary) qubits. In our experiment, an unknown
polarization state of a single photon is teleported over 7 m onto a remote
atomic qubit that also serves as a quantum memory. The teleported state can be
stored and successfully read out for up to 8 micro-second. Besides being of
fundamental interest, teleportation between photonic and atomic qubits with the
direct inclusion of a readable quantum memory represents a step towards an
efficient and scalable quantum network.

any multipartite quantum states. For bipartite pure states partial entropy is a
good entanglement measure. By using partial entropy, we firstly introduce the
Combinatorial Entropy of Fully entangled states (CEF) which can be used to
quantify entanglement for any fully entangled pure states. In order to quantify
entanglement for any multipartite states we also need another concept the
Entanglement Combination (EC) which can be used to completely describe the
entanglement between any parties of the given quantum states. Combining CEF
with EC, we define the Combinatorial Entropy (CE) for any multipartite pure
states and present some nice properties which indicate CE is a good
entanglement measure. Finally, we point out the feasibility of extending these
three concepts to mixed quantum states.

  Measurements: Quantum Information Theory Meets the Unruh-Davies Effect</title><description>  Building on the well-known Unruh-Davies effect, we examine the effects of
projective measurements and quantum communications between accelerated and
stationary observers. We find that the projective measurement by a uniformly
accelerated observer can excite real particles from the vacuum in the inertial
frame, even if no additional particles are created by the measurement process
in the accelerating frame. Furthermore, we show that the particles created by
this accelerating measurement can be highly entangled in the inertial frame,
and it is also possible to use this process to generate even maximally
entangled two-qubit states by a certain arrangement of measurements. As a
byproduct of our analysis, we also show that a single qubit of information can
be perfectly transmitted from the accelerating observer to the inertial one. In
principle, such an effect could be exploited in designing an entangled state
generator for quantum communication.

acting between a gold coated sphere and semiconductor plates with markedly
different charge carrier densities. In the first of these experiments a
patterned Si plate is used which consists of two sections of different dopant
densities and oscillates in the horizontal direction below a sphere. The
measurement scheme in this experiment is differential, i.e., allows the direct
high-precision measurement of the difference of the Casimir forces between the
sphere and sections of the patterned plate or the difference of the equivalent
pressures between Au and patterned parallel plates with static and dynamic
techniques, respectively. The second experiment proposes to measure the Casimir
force between the same sphere and a VO${}_2$ film which undergoes the
insulator-metal phase transition with the increase of temperature. We report
the present status of the interferometer based variable temperature apparatus
developed to perform both experiments and present the first results on the
calibration and sensitivity. The magnitudes of the Casimir forces and pressures
in the experimental configurations are calculated using different theoretical
approaches to the description of optical and conductivity properties of
semiconductors at low frequencies proposed in the literature. It is shown that
the suggested experiments will aid in the resolution of theoretical problems
arising in the application of the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature to
real materials. They will also open new opportunities in nanotechnology.

macroscopic players, say Alice and Bob (or in a more complex form - Alice, Bob
and Cecilia), which can be represented in the quantum-like (QL) way -- by using
a complex probability amplitude (game's ``wave function'') and noncommutative
operators. The crucial point is that games under consideration are so called
extensive form games. Here the order of actions of players is important, such a
game can be represented by the tree of actions. The QL probabilistic behavior
of players is a consequence of incomplete information which is available to
e.g. Bob about the previous action of Alice. In general one could not construct
a classical probability space underlying a QL-game. This can happen even in a
QL-game with two players. In a QL-game with three players Bell's inequality can

of the outgoing momentum flux. We show that the number of particles is
conserved for a resonant state, if we use an expanding volume of integration in
order to take account of the outgoing momentum flux; the number of particles
would decay exponentially in a fixed volume of integration. Moreover, we
introduce new numerical methods of treating the resonant state with the use of
the effective potential. We first give a numerical method of finding a
resonance pole in the complex energy plane. The method seeks an energy
eigenvalue iteratively. We found that our method leads to a super-convergence,
the convergence exponential with respect to the iteration step. The present
method is completely independent of commonly used complex scaling. We also give
a numerical trick for computing the time evolution of the resonant state in a
limited spatial area. Since the wave function of the resonant state is
diverging away from the scattering potential, it has been previously difficult
to follow its time evolution numerically in a finite area.

simultaneous emission of two, three, four and more photon is less than the
emission of a single photon are used. Since classical photon always comes in
bunch, the required single photon source must be nonclassical. In the
well-known antibunched state the rate of simultaneous emission of two photon is
less than that of single photon. But the requirement of quantum cryptography is
a multiphoton version of the antibunched state or the higher order antibunched

with a large system (the macrosystem) described by unknown stochastic
variables. The interaction between the two systems is diagonal for the
microsystem in a certain orthonormal basis, and the interaction gives an
imprint on the macrosystem. Moreover, the interaction is assumed to involve
only small transfers of energy and momentum between the two systems (as
compared to typical energies/momenta within the microsystem). The analysis is
carried out within scattering theory. Calculated in the conventional way, the
transition amplitude for the whole system factorizes. The interaction taking
place within the macrosystem is assumed to depend on the stochastic variables
in such a way that, on the average, no particular basis vector state of the
microsystem is favoured. The density matrix is studied in a formalism which
includes generation of the ingoing state and absorption of the final state.
Then the dependence of the final state on the conventional scattering amplitude
for the microsystem is highly non-linear.
  In the thermodynamic limit of the macrosystem, the density matrix of the
ensemble (of microsystem plus macrosystem) develops into a final state which
involves a set of macroscopically distinguishable states, each with the
microsystem in one of the basis vector states and the macrosystem in an
entangled state.
  For an element of the ensemble, i.e., for a single measurement, the result is
instead a random walk, where the microsystem ends up in one of the basis vector
states (reduction of the wave packet).

oscillator to its quantum ground state by means of radiation-pressure coupling
with a driven optical cavity. We apply it to two experimentally realized
schemes, back-action cooling via a detuned cavity and cold-damping
quantum-feedback cooling, and we determine the ultimate quantum limits of both
schemes for the full parameter range of a stable cavity. While both allow to
reach the oscillator's quantum ground state, we find that back-action cooling
is more efficient in the good cavity limit, i.e. when the cavity bandwidth is
smaller than the mechanical frequency, while cold damping is more suitable for
the bad cavity limit. The results of previous treatments are recovered as
limiting cases of specific parameter regimes.

our theory for the membership weights of items regarding the disjunction of

superposition of that are at the origin of the effects of overextension and
underextension observed by Hampton as deviations from a classical use of the
disjunction. It is essential for the perfect matches we obtain between the

items can be in superpositions of `different numbers states' which proves that
the genuine structure of quantum field theory is needed to match predictions

lead to precision limits on quantum computing. Lower bounds of the error
probability have been obtained for various logic operations from the
commutation relation between the noise operator and the conserved quantity or
from the recently developed universal uncertainty principle for the
noise-disturbance trade-off in general measurements. However, the problem of
obtaining the precision limit to realizing the quantum NOT gate has eluded a
solution from these approaches. Here, we develop a new method for this problem
based on analyzing the trace distance between the output state from the

mathematical apparatus of orthogonal polynomials, we obtain a general lower
bound on the error probability for the realization of the quantum NOT gate in
terms of the number of qubits in the control system under the conservation of
the total angular momentum of the computational qubit plus the the control
system along the direction used to encode the computational basis. The lower
bound turns out to be more stringent than one might expect from previous
results. The new method is expected to lead to more accurate estimates for
physical realizations of various types of quantum computations under
conservation laws, and to contribute to related problems such as the accuracy
of programmable quantum processors.

Motivated by the observation that certain modes of gravitational fluctuations

entropy of such a field, by tracing over its degrees of freedom inside a

sphere when the field is in its ground state, a correction term proportional to
a fractional power of area results when the field is in a superposition of
ground and excited states. The area law is thus recovered for large areas.
Further, we identify location of the degrees of freedom that give rise to the

between a two-level system and the Dirac electron that comes to light when the
two-level system is described within the formalism of second quantization in
terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. The analogy enables one
to introduce all the powerful tools of relativistic QED (albeit in a greatly

useful. In particular, the QED concept of the vacuum polarization finds its
close counterpart in the photon scattering off a two level-system leading via
the linear response theory to the general formulas for the atomic
polarizability and the dynamic single spin susceptibility. To illustrate the
usefulness of these methods, we calculate the polarizability and susceptibility
up to the fourth order of perturbation theory. These {\em ab initio}

optical damping that arise in the phenomenological treatment. We also show that

the degree of quantum decoherence and classical correlations of a harmonic
oscillator interacting with a thermal bath. The transition from quantum to
classical behaviour of the considered system is analyzed and it is shown that
the classicality takes place during a finite interval of time. We calculate
also the decoherence time and show that it has the same scale as the time after
which statistical fluctuations become comparable with quantum fluctuations.

been recently used to analyze quantum phase transitions from a geometrical
perspective. In this paper we unify these two approaches showing that the
underlying mechanism is the critical singular behavior of a complex tensor over
the Hamiltonian parameter space. This is achieved by performing a scaling
analysis of this quantum geometric tensor in the vicinity of the critical
points. In this way most of the previous results are understood on general
grounds and new ones are found. We show that criticality is not a sufficient
condition to ensure superextensive divergence of the geometric tensor, and
state the conditions under which this is possible. The validity of this
analysis is further checked by exact diagonalization of the spin-1/2 XXZ
Heisenberg chain.

  Phase Space Distributions</title><description>  We contrast two sets of conditions that govern the transition in which
classical dynamics emerges from the evolution of a quantum system. The first
was derived by considering the trajectories seen by an observer (dubbed the
``strong'' transition) [Bhattacharya, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85: 4852
(2000)], and the second by considering phase-space densities (the ``weak''
transition) [Greenbaum, et al., Chaos 15, 033302 (2005)]. On the face of it
these conditions appear rather different. We show, however, that in the
semiclassical regime, in which the action of the system is large compared to
$\hbar$, and the measurement noise is small, they both offer an essentially
equivalent local picture. Within this regime, the weak conditions dominate
while in the opposite regime where the action is not much larger than Planck's
constant, the strong conditions dominate.

the need for renewing shared secret keys have made this method unpractical.
This work presents a scheme to turn practical the fast sharing of random keys
over arbitrary Internet channels. Starting with a shared secret key sequence of
length K_0 the users end up with a secure new sequence K &gt;&gt; K_0. Using these
sequences for posteriori message encryption the legitimate users have absolute
security control without the need for third parties. Additionally, the security
level does not depend on the unproven difficulty of factoring numbers in
primes. In the proposed scheme a fast optical random source generates random
bits and noise for key renewals. The transmitted signals are recorded signals
that carries both the random binary signals to be exchanged and physical noise
that cannot be eliminated by the attacker. These signals allow amplification
over the Internet network without degrading security. The proposed system is
also secure against a-posteriori known-plaintext attack on the key.
Information-theoretic analysis is presented and bounds for secure operation are
quantitatively determined.

ranging from quantum information processing to nanotechnology. Typically, the
system whose coherent dynamics one wants to manipulate, interacts with an
environment that smoothly degrades its quantum dynamics. Thus, a precise
understanding of the inner mechanisms of this process, called &quot;decoherence&quot;, is
critical to develop strategies to control the quantum dynamics. In this thesis
we solved the generalized Liouville-von Neumann quantum master equation to
obtain the dynamics of many-spin systems interacting with a spin bath. We also
solve the spin dynamics within the Keldysh formalism. Both methods lead to
identical solutions and together gave us the possibility to obtain numerous
physical predictions that contrast well with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
experiments. We applied these tools for molecular characterizations,
development of new numerical methodologies and the control of quantum dynamics
in experimental implementations. But, more important, these results contributed
to fundamental physical interpretations of how quantum dynamics behaves in open
systems. In particular, we found a manifestation of an environmentally induced
quantum dynamical phase transition.

each qubit in a codeword is subject to a general Hamiltonian interaction with
an independent bath. We first consider the scheme in the case of a trivial
single-qubit code, which provides useful insights into the workings of
continuous error correction and the difference between Markovian and
non-Markovian decoherence. We then study the model of a bit-flip code with each
qubit coupled to an independent bath qubit and subject to continuous
correction, and find its solution. We show that for sufficiently large
error-correction rates, the encoded state approximately follows an evolution of
the type of a single decohering qubit, but with an effectively decreased
coupling constant. The factor by which the coupling constant is decreased
scales quadratically with the error-correction rate. This is compared to the
case of Markovian noise, where the decoherence rate is effectively decreased by
a factor which scales only linearly with the rate of error correction. The
quadratic enhancement depends on the existence of a Zeno regime in the
Hamiltonian evolution which is absent in purely Markovian dynamics. We analyze
the range of validity of this result and identify two relevant time scales.
Finally, we extend the result to more general codes and argue that the
performance of continuous error correction will exhibit the same qualitative
characteristics.

quantum mechanics which does not refer to a classical spacetime manifold. It
follows as a consequence that quantum mechanics as we know it is a limiting
case of a more general nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming
significant at the Planck mass/energy scale. This nonlinearity is responsible
for a dynamically induced collapse of the wave-function, during a quantum
measurement, and it hence falsifies the many-worlds interpretation of quantum
mechanics. We illustrate this conclusion using a mathematical model based on a
generalized Doebner-Goldin equation. The non-Hermitian part of the Hamiltonian
in this norm-preserving, nonlinear, Schrodinger equation dominates during a
quantum measurement, and leads to a breakdown of linear superposition.

&quot;Substate theorem: Let rho and sigma be quantum states in the same Hilbert
space with relative entropy S(rho|sigma) = Tr rho (log rho - log sigma) = c.
Then for all epsilon &gt; 0, there is a state rho' such that the trace distance
||rho' - rho||_t = Tr sqrt{(rho' - rho)^2} &lt;= epsilon, and
rho'/2^{O(c/epsilon^2)} &lt;= sigma.&quot;
  It states that if the relative entropy of rho and sigma is small, then there
is a state rho' close to rho, i.e. with small trace distance ||rho' - rho||_t,
that when scaled down by a factor 2^{O(c)} `sits inside', or becomes a
`substate' of, sigma. This result has several applications in quantum
communication complexity and cryptography. Using the substate theorem, we
derive a privacy trade-off for the set membership problem in the two-party
quantum communication model. Here Alice is given a subset A of [n], Bob an
input i in [n], and they need to determine if i in A.
  &quot;Privacy trade-off for set membership: In any two-party quantum communication
protocol for the set membership problem, if Bob reveals only k bits of
information about his input, then Alice must reveal at least n/2^{O(k)} bits of
information about her input.&quot;
  We also discuss relationships between various information theoretic
quantities that arise naturally in the context of the substate theorem.

the equivalence principle, at least for the finite Casimir energies associated
with perfectly conducting parallel plates. We here add further support to this
conclusion by considering parallel semitransparent plates, that is,
delta-function potentials, acting on a massless scalar field, in a spacetime
defined by Rindler coordinates (tau,x,y,xi). Fixed xi in such a spacetime
represents uniform acceleration. We calculate the force on systems consisting
of one or two such plates at fixed values of xi. In the limit of large Rindler
coordinate xi (small acceleration), we recover (via the equivalence principle)
the situation of weak gravity, and find that the gravitational force on the
system is just Mg, where g is the gravitational acceleration and M is the total
mass of the system, consisting of the mass of the plates renormalized by the
Casimir energy of each plate separately, plus the energy of the Casimir
interaction between the plates. This reproduces the previous result in the
limit as the coupling to the delta-function potential approaches infinity.

about the role of the time-parameter. Especially, the time reference within the
probability algorithm (the Born Rule, BR) is unclear. Using a plausible
principle P1, about the role of probability in a physical theory, and a second
principle P2 affording a most natural way to make BR precise, a logical
conflict with the standard expression for the completeness of QM can be
derived. Rejecting P1 is implausible. Rejecting P2 leads to unphysical results
and to a conflict with a generalization of P2, a principle P3. It is thus made
plausible that the standard expression of QM completeness must be revised. An
absolutely explicit form of the axioms is provided, including a precise form of
the projection postulate. An appropriate expression for QM completeness,

EPR-experiment: by performing suitable measurements on the box it is possible
to ``prepare'' the photon, long after it has escaped, in either of two
complementary states. Consistency requires that the corresponding box
measurements be complementary as well. At first sight it seems, however, that
these measurements can be jointly performed with arbitrary precision: they
pertain to different systems (the center of mass of the box and an internal
clock, respectively). But this is deceptive. As we show by explicit
calculation, although the relevant quantities are simultaneously measurable,
they develop non-vanishing commutators when calculated back to the time of
escape of the photon. This justifies Bohr's qualitative arguments in a precise
way; and it illustrates how the details of the dynamics conspire to guarantee
the requirements of complementarity. In addition, our calculations exhibit a
``fine structure'' in the distribution of the uncertainties over the
complementary quantities: depending on when the box measurement is performed,
the resulting quantum description of the photon differs. This brings us close
to the argumentation of the later EPR thought experiment.

  Environment with External Force</title><description>  We revisit the model of a system made up of a Brownian quantum oscillator
under the influence of an external classical force and linearly coupled to an
environment made up of many quantum oscillators at zero or finite temperature.
We show that the HPZ master equation for the reduced density matrix derived
earlier [B.L. Hu, J.P. Paz, Y. Zhang, Phys. Rev. D 45, 2843 (1992)] with
coefficients obtained from solutions of integro-differential equations can
assume closed functional forms for a fairly general class of spectral densities
of the environment at arbitrary temperature and coupling strength. As an
illustration of these new results we solve the corresponding master equation
and calculate, among other physical quantities, the uncertainty function whose
late time behavior can be obtained fully. This produces a formula for
investigating the standard quantum limit which is central to addressing many
theoretical issues in macroscopic quantum phenomena and experimental concerns
related to low temperature precision measurements. We find that any initial
state always settles down to a Gaussian density matrix whose covariance is
determined by the thermal reservoir and whose mean is determined by the
external force. For more general spectra we show that the solution of the
master equation can be reduced to solving for the motion of a classical
parametric oscillator with parametric frequency determined by the unsolved for
master equation coefficients. States in these systems experience evolution that
is parametrically similar to the simpler evolution explicitly determined for in
the case of Laurent-series spectra.

of Wigner tunneling an electron encounters a classically allowed regions, where
a discrete energy level coincides with its energy, in the magnetic field a
potential barrier is a constant in the direction of tunneling. Along the
tunneling path the certain regions are formed, where, in the classical
language, the kinetic energy of the motion perpendicular to tunneling is
negative. These regions play a role of potential wells, where a discrete energy

the certain magnetic field, is called Euclidean resonance and substantially
depends on a shape of potential forces in the direction perpendicular to
tunneling. Under conditions of Euclidean resonance a long distance underbarrier

state is akin to a quantum section. It defines a reduced pure state in the
cofactor Hilbert space. The collection of all the Wigner functions
corresponding to a full set of parallel quantum sections defines the
Husimi-Wigner reresentation. It occupies an intermediate ground between drastic
suppression of nonclassical features, characteristic of Husimi functions, and
the daunting complexity of higher dimensional Wigner functions. After analysing
these features for simpler states, we exploit this new representation as a
probe of numerically computed eigenstates of chaotic Hamiltonians. The
individual two-dimensional Wigner functions resemble those of semiclassically
quantized states, but the regular ring pattern is broken by dislocations.

position of a particle {\it before} a position measurement is performed on it.
This assumption cannot be deduced from the standard postulates of quantum
mechanics. In the present paper this assumption is made explicit and formally
postulated as a new rule, the {\it quantum typicality rule}. This rule
correlates the positions of the particles at two different times, thus defining
their trajectories. Unexpectedly, this rule is also equivalent to the Born rule
with regard to the explanation of the results of statistical experiments. For
this reason it can be considered a generalization of the Born rule. The
existence of the quantum typicality rule strongly suggests the possibility of a
new trajectory-based formulation of quantum mechanics. According to this new
formulation, a closed quantum system is represented as a {\it quantum process},
which corresponds to a canonical stochastic process in which the probability
measure is replaced by the wave function and the usual frequentist
interpretation of probability is replaced by the quantum typicality rule.

Combining these with the analytic form of the cascade-term yields a simple and

a sum over a few intermediate states. We demonstrate that the cascade term
naturally leads to a nearly Lorentzian shape of the two-photon profiles in the

corrections, the two-photon emission spectra deviate significantly from the
Lorentzian shape in the very distant wings of the resonances. We investigate up
to which distance the two-photon profiles are close to a Lorentzian and discuss
the role of the interference term. We then analyze how the deviation of the
two-photon profiles from the Lorentzian shape affects the dynamics of
cosmological hydrogen recombination. Since in this context the escape of
photons from the Lyman-alpha resonance plays a crucial role, we concentrate on
the two-photon corrections in the vicinity of the Lyman-alpha line. Our

another one labelled $B$ is uncoupled with that. We discuss two cases: (i) the

from the concept of individuality in classical physics, as E. Schroedinger
pointed out in the early steps of the theory. Regarding this fact, some authors
suggested that quantum mechanics does not possess its own language, and
therefore, quantum indistinguishability is not incorporated in the theory from
the beginning. Nevertheless, it is possible to represent the idea of quantum
indistinguishability with a first order language using quasiset theory (Q). In
this work, we show that Q cannot capture one of the most important features of
quantum non individuality, which is the fact that there are quantum systems for
which particle number is not well defined. An axiomatic variant of Q, in which
quasicardinal is not a primitive concept (for a kind of quasisets called finite
quasisets), is also given. This result encourages the searching of theories in
which the quasicardinal, being a secondary concept, stands undefined for some
quasisets, besides showing explicitly that in a set theory about collections of
truly indistinguishable entities, the quasicardinal needs not necessarily be a

represented as efficiently contractible unitary networks, including the
matrix-product states of density matrix renormalization, multiscale
entanglement renormalization (MERA) states, weighted graph states, and quantum
cellular automata. In particular, this provides a tool for varying over classes

self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QD) as a function of static external
electric and magnetic fields. To study QD spin dynamics we measure the degree
of resonant absorption which results from a competition between optical spin
pumping induced by the resonant laser field and spin relaxation induced by
reservoirs. Fundamental interactions that determine spin dynamics in QDs are
hyperfine coupling to QD nuclear spin ensembles, spin-phonon coupling and
exchange-type interactions with a nearby Fermi sea of electrons. We show that
the strength of spin relaxation generated by the three fundamental interactions
can be changed by up to five orders of magnitude upon varying the applied
electric and magnetic fields. We find that the strength of optical spin pumping
that we use to study the spin relaxation is determined predominantly by
hyperfine-induced mixing of single-electron spin states at low magnetic fields
and heavy-light hole mixing at high magnetic fields. Our measurements allow us
to determine the rms value of the hyperfine (Overhauser) field to be ~15 mTesla
with an electron g-factor of g_e=0.6 and a hole mixing strength of |epsilon|^2

EPR-Bell experiments to violate Bell's inequality verify nonlocality, and
nonlocal correlations respect special relativity - are false. Both the EPR-Bell
experiments and theorems to support the &quot;non-signalling principle&quot; are based on
the implicit assumption that all quantum postulates and, in particular, Born's
averaging rule are fully applicable to Cat states. However, this is not the
case. Introducing observables (e.g., correlations) for Cat states violates the
correspondence principle. Pure (macro- and micro-)Cat states must be governed
both by the PMRs and superposition principle. Our (macrorealistic) model of a
one-dimensional completed scattering shows how these principles coexist with
each other, in the case of a one-electron micro-Cat state.

which exploits a mirror inverting spin chain. Within this scheme the spin chain
is used repeatedly as an entanglement bus (EB) to create multi-partite
entanglement. The noise model we consider comprises of each spin of this EB
being exposed to independent local noise which degrades the capabilities of the
EB. Here we concentrate on quantifying its performance as a single-qubit
channel and as a mediator of a two-qubit entangling gate, since these are basic
operations necessary for graph state generation using the EB. In particular,
for the single-qubit case we numerically calculate the average channel fidelity
and whether the channel becomes entanglement breaking, i.e., expunges any
entanglement the transferred qubit may have with other external qubits. We find
that neither local decay nor dephasing noise cause entanglement breaking. This
is in contrast to local thermal and depolarizing noise where we determine a
critical length and critical noise coupling, respectively, at which
entanglement breaking occurs. The critical noise coupling for local
depolarizing noise is found to exhibit a power-law dependence on the chain
length. For two qubits we similarly compute the average gate fidelity and
whether the ability for this gate to create entanglement is maintained. The
concatenation of these noisy gates for the construction of a five qubit linear
cluster state and a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state indicates that the level
of noise that can be tolerated for graph state generation is tightly
constrained.

  standard numerical-electromagnetism techniques</title><description>  We describe a numerical method to compute Casimir forces in arbitrary
geometries, for arbitrary dielectric and metallic materials, with arbitrary
accuracy (given sufficient computational resources). Our approach, based on
well-established integration of the mean stress tensor evaluated via the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem, is designed to directly exploit fast methods
developed for classical computational electromagnetism, since it only involves
repeated evaluation of the Green's function for imaginary frequencies
(equivalently, real frequencies in imaginary time). We develop the approach by
systematically examining various formulations of Casimir forces from the
previous decades and evaluating them according to their suitability for
numerical computation. We illustrate our approach with a simple
finite-difference frequency-domain implementation, test it for known geometries
such as a cylinder and a plate, and apply it to new geometries. In particular,
we show that a piston-like geometry of two squares sliding between metal walls,
in both two and three dimensions with both perfect and realistic metallic
materials, exhibits a surprising non-monotonic ``lateral'' force from the
walls.

underlying ensemble evolves under a classical distribution of unitary
processes. While many incoherent processes appear decoherent, there are
important differences. The distribution functions underlying incoherent
processes are either static or slowly varying with respect to control
operations and so the errors introduced by these distributions are refocusable.
The observation and control of incoherence in small Hilbert spaces is well
known. Here we explore incoherence during an entangling operation, such as is
relevant in quantum information processing. As expected, it is more difficult
to separate incoherence and decoherence over such processes. However, by
studying the fidelity decay under a cyclic entangling map we are able to
identify distinctive experimental signatures of incoherence. This result is
demonstrated both through numerical simulations and experimentally in a three
qubit nuclear magnetic resonance implementation.

effective two-level atoms driven with laser and cavity fields. We show that
interesting ``entangled-state cycles'' arise probabilistically when the (Raman)
transition rates between the two atomic levels are set equal. For odd (even)
$N$, there are $(N+1)/2$ ($N/2$) possible cycles. During each cycle the
$N$-qubit state switches, with each cavity photon emission, between the states
$(|N/2,m&gt;\pm |N/2,-m&gt;)/\sqrt{2}$, where $|N/2,m&gt;$ is a Dicke state in a rotated
collective basis. The quantum number $m$ ($&gt;0$), which distinguishes the
particular cycle, is determined by the photon counting record and varies
randomly from one trajectory to the next. For even $N$ it is also possible,
under the same conditions, to prepare probabilistically (but in steady state)
the Dicke state $|N/2,0&gt;$, i.e., an $N$-qubit state with $N/2$ excitations,
which is of particular interest in the context of multipartite entanglement.

many-body systems. In particular, we consider standard harmonic and spin-1/2
chains, at thermal equilibrium and characterized by few interaction parameters.
The existence of bound entanglement is addressed by calculating explicitly the
negativity of entanglement for different partitions. This allows to individuate
a range of temperatures for which no entanglement can be distilled by means of
local operations, despite the system being globally entangled. We discuss how
the appearance of bound entanglement can be linked to entanglement-area laws,
typical of these systems. Various types of interactions and topologies are
explored, showing that the presence of bound entanglement is an intrinsic

thermal bound entanglement persists for systems composed by an arbitrary number

In the presence of three inhomogeneous light fields, the center-of-mass of a
three-level chiral molecule is subject to an optically induced gauge potential,
and the internal dynamics of the molecules can be described as an adiabatic

We demonstrate numerically that such an induced gauge potential can lead to

analysis of real-valued functions on the Boolean cube. In this paper we present
a version of this inequality for matrix-valued functions on the Boolean cube.
Its proof is based on a powerful inequality by Ball, Carlen, and Lieb. We also
present a number of applications. First, we analyze maps that encode $n$
classical bits into $m$ qubits, in such a way that each set of $k$ bits can be
recovered with some probability by an appropriate measurement on the quantum
encoding; we show that if $m&lt;0.7 n$, then the success probability is
exponentially small in $k$. This result may be viewed as a direct product
version of Nayak's quantum random access code bound. It in turn implies strong
direct product theorems for the one-way quantum communication complexity of
Disjointness and other problems. Second, we prove that error-correcting codes
that are locally decodable with 2 queries require length exponential in the
length of the encoded string. This gives what is arguably the first
``non-quantum'' proof of a result originally derived by Kerenidis and de Wolf
using quantum information theory, and answers a question by Trevisan.

rough expression brings on that the solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation and
the Dirac equation with the Coulomb potential are divergent at the origin of
the coordinates, also the virtual energies, when the nuclear charges number Z &gt;
137, meaning the original solutions do not satisfy the conditions for
determining solution. Any divergences of the wave functions also imply that the
probability density of the meson or the electron would rapidly increase when
they are closing to the atomic nucleus. What it predicts is not a truth that
the atom in ground state would rapidly collapse to the neutron-like. We
consider that the atomic nucleus has definite radius and write the exact
boundary condition for the hydrogen and hydrogen-like atom, then newly solve
the radial Dirac-Coulomb equation and obtain a new exact solution without any
mathematical and physical difficulties. Unexpectedly, the K value constructed
by Dirac is naturally written in the barrier width or the equivalent radius of
the atomic nucleus in solving the Dirac equation with the exact boundary
condition, and it is independent of the quantum energy. Without any divergent
wave function and the virtual energies, we obtain a new formula of the energy
levels that is different from the Dirac formula of the energy levels in the
Coulomb field.

dimensionality) arranged on a line. First, we prove that it is possible to
perform universal adiabatic quantum computation using a one-dimensional quantum
system (with 9 states per particle). This might have practical implications for
experimentalists interested in constructing an adiabatic quantum computer.
Building on the same construction, but with some additional technical effort
and 12 states per particle, we show that the problem of approximating the
ground state energy of a system composed of a line of quantum particles is
QMA-complete; QMA is a quantum analogue of NP. This is in striking contrast to
the fact that the analogous classical problem, namely, one-dimensional
MAX-2-SAT with nearest neighbor constraints, is in P. The proof of the
QMA-completeness result requires an additional idea beyond the usual techniques
in the area: Not all illegal configurations can be ruled out by local checks,
so instead we rule out such illegal configurations because they would, in the
future, evolve into a state which can be seen locally to be illegal. Our
construction implies (assuming the quantum Church-Turing thesis and that
quantum computers cannot efficiently solve QMA-complete problems) that there
are one-dimensional systems which take an exponential time to relax to their
ground states at any temperature, making them candidates for being
one-dimensional spin glasses.

The
problem of distilling local pure states from mixed ones can be cast in an
information theoretic paradigm. The bipartite version of this problem where
local purity must be distilled from an arbitrary quantum state shared between
two parties, Alice and Bob, is closely related to the problem of separating
quantum and classical correlations in the state and in particular, to a measure
of classical correlations called the one-way distillable common randomness. In
Phys. Rev. A 71, 062303 (2005), the optimal rate of local purity distillation
is derived when many copies of a bipartite quantum state are shared between
Alice and Bob, and the parties are allowed unlimited use of a unidirectional
dephasing channel. In the present paper, we extend this result to the setting
in which the use of the channel is bounded. We demonstrate that in the case of
a classical-quantum system, the expression for the local purity distilled is
efficiently computable and provide examples with their tradeoff curves.

crystal solvent, which introduces strong dipolar couplings among the spins.
Although the system Hamiltonian is never fully specified, we demonstrate high

as well as distributed quantum computation. Quantum repeaters improve the
reduction of quantum-communication throughput with distance from exponential to
polynomial. Because a quantum state cannot be copied, a quantum repeater is not
a signal amplifier, but rather executes algorithms for quantum teleportation in
conjunction with a specialized type of quantum error correction called
purification to raise the fidelity of the quantum states. We introduce our
banded purification scheme, which is especially effective when the fidelity of
coupled qubits is low, improving the prospects for experimental realization of
such systems. The resulting throughput is calculated via detailed simulations
of a long line composed of shorter hops. Our algorithmic improvements increase

important simplifying assumptions: (i) the gas of atoms forms a regular lattice

minimize the dipole potential. We show that the two assumptions are
inconsistent: the configuration of atoms minimizing the dipole potential is not
a perfect lattice. Assumption (ii) is erroneous, as in the strong coupling

steady state, where the dipole forces vanish, is indeed a regular lattice.
Furthermore, the bistability predicted by Meiser and Meystre does not occur in

propagates freely, and this makes it possible to analyze the walks in terms of
scattering theory. The probability of entering a graph from one tail and
leaving from another can be found from the scattering matrix of the graph. We
show how the scattering matrix of a graph that is an automorphic image of the
original is related to the scattering matrix of the original graph, and we show
how the scattering matrix of the reverse graph is related to that of the
original graph. Modifications of graphs and the effects of these modifications
are then considered. In particular we show how the scattering matrix of a graph
is changed if we remove two tails and replace them with an edge or cut an edge
and add two tails. This allows us to combine graphs, that is if we connect two
graphs we can construct the scattering matrix of the combined graph from those

crossings in K. Let $\epsilon_{1}$ and $\epsilon_{2}$ be two positive real
numbers such that $\epsilon_{2}$ is less than or equal to 1.
  In this paper, we create two algorithms for computing the value of the Jones
polynomial of K at all points $t=exp(i\phi)$ of the unit circle in the complex
plane such that the absolute value of $\phi$ is less than or equal to $\pi/3$.
  The first algorithm, called the classical 3-stranded braid (3-SB) algorithm,
is a classical deterministic algorithm that has time complexity O(L). The
second, called the quantum 3-SB algorithm, is a quantum algorithm that computes
an estimate of the Jones polynomial of K at $exp(i\phi))$ within a precision of
$\epsilon_{1}$ with a probability of success bounded below by $1-\epsilon_{2}%.
The execution time complexity of this algorithm is O(nL), where n is the
ceiling function of (ln(4/\epsilon_{2}))/(2(\epsilon_{2})^2). The compilation
time complexity, i.e., an asymptotic measure of the amount of time to assemble
the hardware that executes the algorithm, is O(L).

standard argument favoring this assertion is based on a possibility to expand
the energy or the entropy of the system into the Taylor series in the ramp
speed. Here we show that this argumentation is only valid in high enough

three generic regimes of a system response to a slow ramp: (A) mean-field, (B)
non-analytic, and (C) non-adiabatic. In the last regime the limits of the ramp
speed going to zero and the system size going to infinity do not commute and
the adiabatic process does not exist in the thermodynamic limit. We support our

These characteristics allowed us to construct a 10-GHz clock QKD system and
thus distribute secure keys over channel loss of 42 dB. In addition, we
achieved a 17 kbit/s secure key rate over 105 km of optical fibre, which is two
orders of magnitude higher than the previous record, and a 12.1 bit/s secure
key rate over 200 km of optical fibre, which is the longest terrestrial QKD yet
demonstrated. The keys generated in our experiment are secure against both
general collective attacks on individual photons and a specific collective
attack on multi-photons, known as a sequential unambiguous state discrimination
(USD) attack.

life? Normally, no violation can be seen either because of decoherence or the
restriction of coarse-grained measurements, transforming the time evolution of
any quantum state into a classical time evolution of a statistical mixture. We
find the sufficient condition for these classical evolutions for spin systems
under coarse-grained measurements. Then we demonstrate that there exist
&quot;non-classical&quot; Hamiltonians whose time evolution cannot be understood
classically, although at every instant of time the quantum spin state appears
as a classical mixture. We suggest that such Hamiltonians are unlikely to be

intermediate states have been proposed. Different nonclassical effects have
also been reported in these intermediate states. But till now higher order
antibunching or higher order subpoissonian photon statistics is predicted only
in one type of intermediate state, namely shadowed negative binomial state.
Recently we have shown the existence of higher order antibunching in some
simple nonlinear optical processes to establish that higher order antibunching
is not a rare phenomenon (J. Phys. B 39 (2006) 1137). To establish our earlier
claim further, here we have shown that the higher order antibunching can be
seen in different intermediate states, such as binomial state, reciprocal
binomial state, hypergeometric state, generalized binomial state, negative
binomial state and photon added coherent state. We have studied the possibility
of observing the higher order subpoissonian photon statistics in different
limits of intermediate states. The effect of different control parameters have
also been studied in this connection and it has been shown that the depth of
nonclassicality can be tuned by controlling various physical parameters.

system can be when the subspace contains only highly entangled states. This is
motivated in part by results of Hayden et al., which show that in large d x
d--dimensional systems there exist random subspaces of dimension almost d^2,
all of whose states have entropy of entanglement at least log d - O(1). It is
also related to results due to Parthasarathy on the dimension of completely
entangled subspaces, which have connections with the construction of
unextendible product bases. Here we take as entanglement measure the Schmidt
rank, and determine, for every pair of local dimensions dA and dB, and every r,
the largest dimension of a subspace consisting only of entangled states of
Schmidt rank r or larger. This exact answer is a significant improvement on the
best bounds that can be obtained using random subspace techniques. We also
determine the converse: the largest dimension of a subspace with an upper bound
on the Schmidt rank. Finally, we discuss the question of subspaces containing
only states with Schmidt equal to r.

formulation is an entirely general one in which Hilbert spaces play no special

defining the adjunction, and we prove that they are eigenstates of the lowering

exponential of a raising morphism acting on the zero-particle state. Finally,
we examine all of these constructions in a suitable category of Hilbert spaces,

  Bose-Einstein condensed and normal phases</title><description>  We formulate a bosonic dynamical mean-field theory (B-DMFT) which provides a
comprehensive, thermodynamically consistent framework for the theoretical
investigation of correlated lattice bosons. The B-DMFT is applicable for
arbitrary values of the coupling parameters and temperature and becomes exact
in the limit of high spatial dimensions d or coordination number Z of the
lattice. In contrast to its fermionic counterpart the construction of the
B-DMFT requires different scalings of the hopping amplitudes with Z depending
on whether the bosons are in their normal state or in the Bose-Einstein
condensate. A detailed discussion of how this conceptual problem can be
overcome by performing the scaling in the action rather than in the Hamiltonian
itself is presented. The B-DMFT treats normal and condensed bosons on equal
footing and thus includes the effects caused by their dynamic coupling. It
reproduces all previously investigated limits in parameter space such as the
Beliaev-Popov and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximations and generalizes the
existing mean-field theories of interacting bosons. The self-consistency
equations of the B-DMFT are those of a bosonic single-impurity coupled to two
reservoirs corresponding to bosons in the condensate and in the normal state,
respectively. We employ the B-DMFT to solve a model of itinerant and localized,
interacting bosons analytically. The local correlations are found to enhance
the condensate density and the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) transition
temperature T_{BEC}. This effect may be used experimentally to increase T_{BEC}

local operations and classical communication (LOCC) has attracted significant
attention. The latest work in the literature on this problem showed that two
multipartite unitary operations can always be perfectly distinguished by LOCC
when a finite number of runs are allowable. However, in these schemes, local
entanglement (an entangled state holden by one party) was required, which seems
to imply that local entanglement is necessary for perfect discrimination
between unitary operations by LOCC. In this article, we show that a perfect

be achieved without exploiting any entanglement. As a result, we conclude that
local entanglement is not necessary for perfect discrimination between unitary

is shown explicitly that the decoherence factor which displays a Gaussian decay

effect. The Casimir energy can be written as a sum over the modes of a real
cavity and one may identify two sorts of modes, two evanescent surface plasmon
modes and propagative modes. As one of the surface plasmon modes becomes
propagative for some choice of parameters we adopt an adiabatic mode definition
where we follow this mode into the propagative sector and count it together
with the surface plasmon contribution, calling this contribution &quot;plasmonic&quot;.
We evaluate analytically the contribution of the plasmonic modes to the Casimir
energy. Surprisingly we find that this becomes repulsive for intermediate and
large mirror separations. The contribution of surface plasmons to the Casimir
energy plays a fundamental role not only at short but also at large distances.
This suggests possibilities to taylor the Casimir force via a manipulation of
the surface plasmons properties.

equivalent to an orthonormal tetrad of vector fields together with a complex
scalar field. In this paper, we show that using Hestenes' tetrad for the spin
connection in a Riemannian space-time leads to a Yang-Mills formulation of the
Dirac Lagrangian in which the bispinor field is mapped to a set of Yang-Mills
gauge potentials and a complex scalar field. This result was previously proved
for a Minkowski space-time using Fierz identities. As an application we derive
several different non-Riemannian spin connections found in the literature
directly from an arbitrary linear connection acting on Hestenes' tetrad and
scalar fields. We also derive spin connections for which Dirac's bispinor
equation is form invariant. Previous work has not considered form invariance of
the Dirac equation as a criterion for defining a general spin connection.

corrected. An important class of such operations are {\em transversal}, acting
bitwise between corresponding qubits in each code block, thus allowing error
propagation to be carefully limited. If any quantum operation could be
implemented using a set of such gates, the set would be {\em universal}; codes
with such a universal, transversal gate set have been widely desired for
efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation. We study the structure of
GF(4)-additive quantum codes and prove that no universal set of transversal
logic operations exists for these codes. This result strongly supports the idea
that additional primitive operations, based for example on quantum
teleportation, are necessary to achieve universal fault-tolerant computation on
additive codes.

  cavity on a chip</title><description>  An optical cavity enhances the interaction between atoms and light, and the
rate of coherent atom-photon coupling can be made larger than all decoherence
rates of the system. For single atoms, this strong coupling regime of cavity
quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been the subject of spectacular experimental
advances, and great efforts have been made to control the coupling rate by
trapping and cooling the atom towards the motional ground state, which has been
achieved in one dimension so far. For N atoms, the three-dimensional ground
state of motion is routinely achieved in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates
(BECs), but although first experiments combining BECs and optical cavities have
been reported recently, coupling BECs to strong-coupling cavities has remained
an elusive goal. Here we report such an experiment, which is made possible by
combining a new type of fibre-based cavity with atom chip technology. This
allows single-atom cQED experiments with a simplified setup and realizes the
new situation of N atoms in a cavity each of which is identically and strongly
coupled to the cavity mode. Moreover, the BEC can be positioned
deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a
single antinode of the standing-wave cavity field. This gives rise to a
controlled, tunable coupling rate, as we confirm experimentally. We study the
heating rate caused by a cavity transmission measurement as a function of the
coupling rate and find no measurable heating for strongly coupled BECs. The
spectrum of the coupled atoms-cavity system, which we map out over a wide range
of atom numbers and cavity-atom detunings, shows vacuum Rabi splittings
exceeding 20 gigahertz, as well as an unpredicted additional splitting which we
attribute to the atomic hyperfine structure.

conjunction with quantum information processing tasks such as cloning.
Considerations of such joint measurements have until now been restricted to a
certain class of observables that can be characterized by a form of covariance.
Here we investigate conditions for the joint measurability of arbitrary pairs
of qubit observables. For pairs of noncommuting sharp qubit observables, a
notion of approximate joint measurement is introduced. Optimal approximate
joint measurements are shown to lie in the class of covariant joint
measurements. The marginal observables found to be optimal approximators are
generally not among the coarse-grainings of the observables to be approximated.
This yields scope for the improvement of existing joint measurement schemes.
Both the quality of the approximations and the intrinsic unsharpness of the
approximators are shown to be subject to Heisenberg-type uncertainty relations.

potential in high-precision quantum measurements, for example in the detection
of gravitational waves. Equally promising applications have been proposed in
quantum communication. However, after 20 years of intensive research doubts

  mixing with femtosecond laser pulses</title><description>  We propose a method to reconstruct the vibrational quantum state of molecules
excited by a general excitation laser pulse. Unlike existing methods, we do not
require the molecules before excitation to be in a pure state, allowing us to
treat the important case of initially thermally excited molecules. Even if only
a single initial level is appreciably populated, initial levels with small
populations can still give major contributions to the unknown vibrational
state, making it essential to take them into account. In addition to the
excitation pulse, the method uses two incident, short laser pulses in a
non-co-linear geometry to create four-wave mixing in the molecules. The
measurements used in the reconstruction are spectra of the outgoing four-wave
mixing pulse at different time delays of the excitation laser pulse. An
important point is that the method does not require detailed knowledge of
molecular transition moments between excited states nor of any of the incoming
laser pulses, but circumvents this requirement by using one or more calibration
laser pulses in a separate experiment either before or after the main data are
recorded. The only requirements for the calibration laser pulses are that the
constant parts of their spectrums should together cover the spectral range of
the excitation laser pulse, and the constant part of each should have
sufficient spectral overlap with one other calibration pulse to populate two of
the same levels. Finally, we discuss the extension of the reconstruction method
in this paper to more general situations, hereby presenting the new idea of
quantum state reconstruction through perturbations with calibration.

regimes for achieving complete coherent transfer of population in such a

strengths, the flow of population between the states of the system can be made
periodic in time. In the second regime, by employing a &quot;counterintuitive&quot;
sequence of couplings, the coherent population trapping eigenstate of the
system can be rotated from the initial to the final desired state, which is an
equivalent of the STIRAP technique for atoms or molecules. Our results may be

coupled into a chain and exchanging their angular momenta with a low
temperature phonon bath. Our master equation has four generators; we
concentrate on the damping and diffusion and use them to study the relaxation
and decoherence of a Heisenberg SQUID chain whose spectrum exhibits critical
point energy-level crossings, entangled states, and pairs of resonant
transitions. We note that at an energy-level crossing the relevant bath
wavelengths are so long that even well-spaced large SQUIDs can partially
exhibit collective coupling to the bath, dramatically reducing certain
relaxation and decoherence rates. Also, transitions into entangled states can
occur even in the case of an independent coupling of each SQUID to the bath.
Finally, the pairs of resonant transitions can cause decaying oscillations to
emerge in a lower energy subspace.

squared Euclidean distance between states and their images over the set of
single qubit unitary transformations. Moreover, both in the $(2\times{D})$- and

exactly coincides with the linear entropy (and thus as well with the tangle

unitary transformations. Each quantum state has a stabilizer subgroup and a
corresponding Lie algebra, the structure of which is a local unitary invariant.
In this paper, we study the structure of the stabilizer subalgebra for n-qubit
pure states, and find its maximum dimension to be n-1 for nonproduct states of
three qubits and higher. The n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state has a
stabilizer subalgebra that achieves the maximum possible dimension for pure
nonproduct states. The converse, however, is not true: we show examples of pure
4-qubit states that achieve the maximum nonproduct stabilizer dimension, but
have stabilizer subalgebra structures different from that of the n-qubit GHZ
state.

sufficiently small, then approximate quantum error correction is possible,
thereby generalizing what happens for coherent information. Explicit bounds are
obtained for the entanglement of formation and the distillable entanglement,
and their validity naturally extends to other bipartite entanglement measures
in between. Robustness of derived criteria is analyzed and their tightness
compared. Finally, as a byproduct, we prove a bound quantifying how large the

any given finite dimensional bipartite system, thus providing a sufficient

In order to obtain the atom-wall force fluctuation we first define an operator
directly associated to the force experienced by the atom considered as a
polarizable body in an electromagnetic field, and we use a time-averaged force
operator in order to avoid ultraviolet divergences appearing in the fluctuation
of the force. This time-averaged force operator takes into account that any
measurement involves a finite time. We also calculate the Casimir-Polder force
fluctuation for an atom between two conducting walls. Experimental
observability of these Casimir-Polder force fluctuations is also discussed, as
well as the dependence of the relative force fluctuation on the duration of the

  critical point</title><description>  We present here our study of the adiabatic quantum dynamics of a random Ising
chain across its quantum critical point. The model investigated is an Ising
chain in a transverse field with disorder present both in the exchange coupling
and in the transverse field. The transverse field term is proportional to a
function $\Gamma(t)$ which, as in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, is linearly
reduced to zero in time with a rate $\tau^{-1}$, $\Gamma(t)=-t/\tau$, starting
at $t=-\infty$ from the quantum disordered phase ($\Gamma=\infty$) and ending
at $t=0$ in the classical ferromagnetic phase ($\Gamma=0$). We first analyze
the distribution of the gaps -- occurring at the critical point $\Gamma_c=1$ --
which are relevant for breaking the adiabaticity of the dynamics. We then
present extensive numerical simulations for the residual energy $E_{\rm res}$
and density of defects $\rho_k$ at the end of the annealing, as a function of
the annealing inverse rate $\tau$. %for different lenghts of the chain. Both
the average $E_{\rm res}(\tau)$ and $\rho_k(\tau)$ are found to behave
logarithmically for large $\tau$, but with different exponents, $[E_{\rm
res}(\tau)/L]_{\rm av}\sim 1/\ln^{\zeta}(\tau)$ with $\zeta\approx 3.4$, and
$[\rho_k(\tau)]_{\rm av}\sim 1/\ln^{2}(\tau)$. We propose a mechanism for
$1/\ln^2{\tau}$-behavior of $[\rho_k]_{\rm av}$ based on the Landau-Zener
tunneling theory and on a Fisher's type real-space renormalization group
analysis of the relevant gaps. The model proposed shows therefore a
paradigmatic example of how an adiabatic quantum computation can become very
slow when disorder is at play, even in absence of any source of frustration.

particular the Hamiltonian must be diagonalizable and have a real spectrum. For
a time-independent Hamiltonian (with a discrete spectrum) these conditions
ensure the existence of a positive-definite inner product that renders the
Hamiltonian self-adjoint. Unlike for a time-independent Hamiltonian, this does
not imply the unitarity of the Schroedinger time-evolution for a general
time-dependent Hamiltonian. We give an additional necessary and sufficient
condition for the unitarity of time-evolution. In particular, we obtain the
general form of a two-level Hamiltonian that fulfils this condition. We show
that this condition is geometrical in nature and that it implies the reality of
the adiabatic geometric phases. We also address the problem of the uniqueness

  Vacuum</title><description>  In this paper we consider the question of the degree to which negative and
positive energy are intertwined. We examine in more detail a previously studied
quantum state of the massless minimally coupled scalar field, which we call a
``Helfer state''. This is a state in which the energy density can be made
arbitrarily negative over an arbitrarily large region of space, but only at one
instant in time. In the Helfer state, the negative energy density is
accompanied by rapidly time-varying energy fluxes. It is the latter feature
which allows the quantum inequalities, bounds which restrict the magnitude and
duration of negative energy, to hold for this class of states. An observer who
initially passes through the negative energy region will quickly encounter
fluxes of positive energy which subsequently enter the region. We examine in
detail the correlation between the energy density and flux in the Helfer state
in terms of their expectation values. We then study the correlation function
between energy density and flux in the Minkowski vacuum state, for a massless
minimally coupled scalar field in both two and four dimensions. In this latter
analysis we examine correlation functions rather than expectation values.
Remarkably, we see qualitatively similar behavior to that in the Helfer state.
More specifically, an initial negative energy vacuum fluctuation in some region
of space is correlated with a subsequent flux fluctuation of positive energy
into the region. We speculate that the mechanism which ensures that the quantum
inequalities hold in the Helfer state, as well as in other quantum states
associated with negative energy, is, at least in some sense, already
``encoded'' in the fluctuations of the vacuum.

It is our believe that all Gelfand Shilov spaces, especially those with
quasianalytic test function spaces, are good domains for the quantum field
theory. The theory requires technical results from the theory of generalized
functions and not merely differential calculus and well defined Fourier
transform, but also the kernel theorem and the structural theorem. In the paper
we give the structural (regularity) theorem and kernel theorem for
Gelfand-Shilov spaces, of Roumieu and Beurling type.

  finite evidence</title><description>  In the modern Bayesian view classical probability theory is simply an
extension of conventional logic, i.e., a quantitative tool that allows for
consistent reasoning in the presence of uncertainty. Classical theory
presupposes, however, that--at least in principle--the amount of evidence that
an experimenter can accumulate always matches the size of the hypothesis space.
I investigate how the framework for consistent reasoning must be modified in
non-classical situations where hypotheses form a continuum, yet the maximum
evidence accessible through experiment is not allowed to exceed some finite
upper bound. Invoking basic consistency requirements pertaining to the
preparation and composition of systems, as well as to the continuity of
probabilities, I show that the modified theory must have an internal symmetry
isomorphic to the unitary group. It thus appears that the only consistent
algorithm for plausible reasoning about a continuum of hypotheses on the basis
of finite evidence is furnished by quantum theory in complex Hilbert space.

state of a quantum dot, connected to two leads. We analyze the role played by
the different kinds of resonances in the transmission spectra and by the number
of scattering channels, into the amount of quantum correlations between the two
identical carriers. It is shown that the entanglement between their energy
states is not sensitive to the presence of Breit-Wigner resonances, while it
presents a peculiar behavior in correspondence of Fano peaks: two close maxima
separated by a minimum, for a two-channel scattering, a single maximum for a
multi-channel scattering. Such a behavior is ascribed to the different
mechanisms characterizing the two types of resonances. Our results suggest that
the production and detection of entanglement in quantum dot structures may be
controlled by the manipulation of Fano resonances through external fields.

We apply our formalism to a two-level system evolving nonadiabatically under

probability density P(x). However, this ``standard'' j is in fact only one of
infinitely many that transform correctly and satisfy \dot P + \del . j=0. In
this article I show that there is a unique j that can be determined
experimentally as a weak value using techniques that would make sense to a
classical physicist. Moreover, this operationally defined j equals the standard
j, so, assuming \dot x = j/P, the possible Bohmian paths can also be determined
experimentally from a large enough ensemble. Furthermore, this approach to
deriving BM singles out x as the hidden variable, because (for example) the
operationally defined momentum current is in general incompatible with the
evolution of the momentum distribution. Finally I discuss how, in this setting,
the usual quantum probabilities can be derived from a Bayesian standpoint, via

cryptography. It allows to transform a raw key about which an attacker has some
limited knowledge into a fully secure random key, on which the attacker has
essentially no information. Up to date, only very few randomness-extraction
techniques are known to work against an attacker holding quantum information on
the raw key. This is very much in contrast to the classical (non-quantum)
setting, which is much better understood and for which a vast amount of
different techniques are known and proven to work.
  We prove a new randomness-extraction technique, which is known to work in the
classical setting, to be secure against a quantum attacker as well. Randomness
extraction is done by XOR'ing a so-called delta-biased mask to the raw key. Our
result allows to extend the classical applications of this extractor to the
quantum setting. We discuss the following two applications. We show how to
encrypt a long message with a short key, information-theoretically secure
against a quantum attacker, provided that the attacker has enough quantum
uncertainty on the message. This generalizes the concept of entropically-secure
encryption to the case of a quantum attacker. As second application, we show
how to do error-correction without leaking partial information to a quantum
attacker. Such a technique is useful in settings where the raw key may contain
errors, since standard error-correction techniques may provide the attacker
with information on, say, a secret key that was used to obtain the raw key.

In
making this distinction precise, we are led to a novel classification of hidden
variable models of quantum theory. Indeed, representatives of each class can be
found among existing constructions for two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Our
approach also provides a fruitful new perspective on arguments for the
nonlocality and incompleteness of quantum theory. Specifically, we show that
for models wherein the quantum state has the status of something real, the
failure of locality can be established through an argument considerably more
straightforward than Bell's theorem. The historical significance of this result
becomes evident when one recognizes that the same reasoning is present in
Einstein's preferred argument for incompleteness, which dates back to 1935.
This fact suggests that Einstein was seeking not just any completion of quantum
theory, but one wherein quantum states are solely representative of our
knowledge. Our hypothesis is supported by an analysis of Einstein's attempts to
clarify his views on quantum theory and the circumstance of his otherwise
puzzling abandonment of an even simpler argument for incompleteness from 1927.

so-called mode entanglement, analyzing the differences between different types
of particles in this context. We first discuss the role of coherent states in
such experiments, and we comment on the existence of coherent states in nature.
The discussion of coherent states naturally raises questions about the role of
particle statistics in this problem. Although the Pauli exclusion principle
precludes coherent states with a large number of fermionic particles, we find
that a large number of fermionic coherent states, each containing at most one
particle, can be used to achieve the same effect as a bosonic coherent state
for the purposes of this problem. The discussion of superselection rules arises
naturally in this context, because their applicability to a given situation
prohibits the use of coherent states. This limitation particularly affects the
scenario that we propose for detecting the mode entanglement of fermionic
particles.

associative and stems from the composition of quantum maps acting on a simple
quantum system. It induces a semi-group in the subset of states with maximally
mixed partial traces. Subadditivity of the von Neumann entropy with respect to
this product is proved. It is equivalent to subadditivity of the entropy of
bistochastic maps with respect to their composition, where the entropy of a map
is the entropy of the corresponding state under the Jamiolkowski isomorphism.
Strong dynamical subadditivity of a concatenation of three bistochastic maps is
established. Analogous bounds for the entropy of a composition are derived for
general stochastic maps. In the classical case they lead to new bounds for the

The loss of entanglement for the maximally entangled two-qubit states, can be

shallow as to support only two bound states, and we prepare the atoms in the

potential analogous to those encountered in condensed-matter systems.
Experimentally, we find that a square pulse consisting of lattice displacements
and a delay is more efficient than single-step and Gaussian pulses. This is
described as an example of coherent control. It is striking that contrary to
the intuition that soft pulses minimize loss, the Gaussian pulse is
outperformed by the square pulse. Numerical calculations are in strong
agreement with our experimental results and show the superiority of the square
pulse to the single-step pulse for all lattice depths and to the Gaussian pulse
for lattice depths greater than 7 lattice recoil energies. We also compare the
effectiveness of these pulses for reviving oscillations of atoms in vibrational
superposition states using the pulse-echo technique. We find that the square

pulse. These improved echo pulses allow us to probe coherence at longer times

gap for a weak probe field under the conditions of electromagnetically induced
transparency. This system possesses a number of advantageous properties,
including reduced relaxation of Raman coherence and the associated probe
absorption, and simultaneous enhancement of the index modulation and the

The theoretical Casimir pressures calculated using the new approach are

information processing device. Typically, QEC is designed with minimal
assumptions about the noise process; this generic assumption exacts a high cost
in efficiency and performance. In physical systems, errors are not likely to be
arbitrary; rather we will have reasonable models for the structure of quantum
decoherence. We may choose quantum error correcting codes and recovery
operations that specifically target the most likely errors.
  We present a convex optimization method to determine the optimal (in terms of
average entanglement fidelity) recovery operation for a given channel,
encoding, and information source. This is solvable via a semidefinite program
(SDP). We present computational algorithms to generate near-optimal recovery
operations structured to begin with a projective syndrome measurement. These
structured operations are more computationally scalable than the SDP required
for computing the optimal; we can thus numerically analyze longer codes. Using
Lagrange duality, we bound the performance of the structured recovery
operations and show that they are nearly optimal in many relevant cases.
  We present two classes of channel-adapted quantum error correcting codes
specifically designed for the amplitude damping channel. These have
significantly higher rates with shorter block lengths than corresponding
generic quantum error correcting codes. Both classes are stabilizer codes, and
have good fidelity performance with stabilizer recovery operations. The
encoding, syndrome measurement, and syndrome recovery operations can all be
implemented with Clifford group operations.

interaction between matter and an electromagnetic field confined within a
resonator structure, and is providing a useful platform for developing concepts
in quantum information processing. By using high-quality resonators, a strong
coupling regime can be reached experimentally in which atoms coherently
exchange a photon with a single light-field mode many times before dissipation
sets in. This has led to fundamental studies with both microwave and optical
resonators. To meet the challenges posed by quantum state engineering and
quantum information processing, recent experiments have focused on laser
cooling and trapping of atoms inside an optical cavity. However, the tremendous
degree of control over atomic gases achieved with Bose-Einstein condensation
has so far not been used for cavity QED. Here we achieve the strong coupling of
a Bose-Einstein condensate to the quantized field of an ultrahigh-finesse
optical cavity and present a measurement of its eigenenergy spectrum. This is a
conceptually new regime of cavity QED, in which all atoms occupy a single mode
of a matter-wave field and couple identically to the light field, sharing a
single excitation. This opens possibilities ranging from quantum communication
to a wealth of new phenomena that can be expected in the many-body physics of
quantum gases with cavity-mediated interactions.

  output entropy conjecture</title><description>  Previous work on the classical information capacities of bosonic channels has
established the capacity of the single-user pure-loss channel, bounded the
capacity of the single-user thermal-noise channel, and bounded the capacity
region of the multiple-access channel. The latter is a multi-user scenario in
which several transmitters seek to simultaneously and independently communicate
to a single receiver. We study the capacity region of the bosonic broadcast
channel, in which a single transmitter seeks to simultaneously and
independently communicate to two different receivers. It is known that the
tightest available lower bound on the capacity of the single-user thermal-noise
channel is that channel's capacity if, as conjectured, the minimum von Neumann
entropy at the output of a bosonic channel with additive thermal noise occurs
for coherent-state inputs. Evidence in support of this minimum output entropy
conjecture has been accumulated, but a rigorous proof has not been obtained. In
this paper, we propose a new minimum output entropy conjecture that, if proved
to be correct, will establish that the capacity region of the bosonic broadcast
channel equals the inner bound achieved using a coherent-state encoding and
optimum detection. We provide some evidence that supports this new conjecture,
but again a full proof is not available.

entropy at large sub-system size, in integrable quantum field theories with
diagonal scattering matrices. We find a remarkably universal result, depending
only on the particle spectrum of the theory and not on the details of the
scattering matrix. We employ the &quot;replica trick&quot; whereby the entropy is
obtained as the derivative with respect to n of the trace of the n-th power of
the reduced density matrix of the sub-system, evaluated at n=1. The main
novelty of our work is the introduction of a particular type of twist fields in
quantum field theory that are naturally related to branch points in an
n-sheeted Riemann surface. Their two-point function directly gives the scaling
limit of the trace of the n-th power of the reduced density matrix. Taking
advantage of integrability, we use the expansion of this two-point function in
terms of form factors of the twist fields, in order to evaluate it at large
distances in the two-particle approximation. Although this is a well-known
technique, the new geometry of the problem implies a modification of the form
factor equations satisfied by standard local fields of integrable quantum field
theory. We derive the new form factor equations and provide solutions, which we
specialize both to the Ising and sinh-Gordon models.

photons, which can be used to explain the slow light propagation with the
mechanism of electromagnetically induced transparency. As quasi-particles,
these collective excitations possess the typical feature of the matter
particles, which can be reflected and deflected by the inhomogeneous medium in
its spatial motion with some velocity. In this paper we develop a quantum
theory to systematically describe the spatial motion of polaritons in
inhomogeneous magnetic and optical fields. This theoretical approach treats
these quasi-particles through an effective Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation with
anisotropic depression that the longitudinal motion is like a
ultra-relativistic motion of a &quot;slow light velocity&quot; while the transverse
motion is of non-relativity with certain effective mass. We find that, after
passing through the EIT medium, the light ray bends due to the
spatial-dependent profile of external field. This phenomenon explicitly
demonstrates the exotic corpuscular property of polaritons with anisotropic
nature.

  Scattering Processes</title><description>  The coherent control of scattering processes is considered, with electron
impact dissociation of H$_2^+$ used as an example. The physical mechanism
underlying coherently controlled stationary state scattering is exposed by
analyzing a control scenario that relies on previously established entanglement
requirements between the scattering partners. Specifically, initial state
entanglement assures that all collisions in the scattering volume yield the
desirable scattering configuration. Scattering is controlled by preparing the
particular internal state wave function that leads to the favored collisional
configuration in the collision volume. This insight allows coherent control to
be extended to the case of time-dependent scattering. Specifically, we identify
reactive scattering scenarios using incident wave packets of translational
motion where coherent control is operational and initial state entanglement is
unnecessary. Both the stationary and time-dependent scenarios incorporate
extended coherence features, making them physically distinct. From a
theoretical point of view, this work represents a large step forward in the
qualitative understanding of coherently controlled reactive scattering. From an
experimental viewpoint, it offers an alternative to entanglement-based control
schemes. However, both methods present significant challenges to existing
experimental technologies.

  Dissociation of D2+</title><description>  We examine the attosecond electron recollision dissociation of D2+ recently
demonstrated experimentally [H. Niikura et al., Nature (London) 421, 826
(2003)] from a coherent control perspective. In this process, a strong laser
field incident on D2 ionizes an electron, accelerates the electron in the laser
field to eV energies, and then drives the electron to recollide with the parent
ion, causing D2+ dissociation. A number of results are demonstrated. First, a
full dimensional Strong Field Approximation (SFA) model is constructed and
shown to be in agreement with the original experiment. This is then used to
rigorously demonstrate that the experiment is an example of coherent pump-dump
control. Second, extensions to bichromatic coherent control are proposed by
considering dissociative recollision of molecules prepared in a coherent
superposition of vibrational states. Third, by comparing the results to similar
scenarios involving field-free attosecond scattering of independently prepared
D2+ and electron wave packets, recollision dissociation is shown to provide an
example of wave-packet coherent control of reactive scattering. Fourth, this
analysis makes clear that it is the temporal correlations between the continuum
electron and D2+ wave packet, and not entanglement, that are crucial for the
sub-femtosecond probing resolution demonstrated in the experiment. This result
clarifies some misconceptions regarding the importance of entanglement in the
recollision probing of D2+. Finally, signatures of entanglement between the
recollision electron and the atomic fragments, detectable via coincidence
measurements, are identified.

of tools from many-body physics - matrix product states, finitely correlated

hence constitutes an instance where a quantum information problem - how to
realize quantum computation - was approached using tools from many-body theory
and not vice versa. We give a more detailed description of the setting, and
present a large number of new examples. We find novel computational schemes,
which differ from the original one-way computer for example in the way the
randomness of measurement outcomes is handled. Also, schemes are presented
where the logical qubits are no longer strictly localized on the resource
state. Notably, we find a great flexibility in the properties of the universal
resource states: They may for example exhibit non-vanishing long-range
correlation functions or be locally arbitrarily close to a pure state. We
discuss variants of Kitaev's toric code states as universal resources, and
contrast this with situations where they can be efficiently classically
simulated. This framework opens up a way of thinking of tailoring resource
states to specific physical systems, such as cold atoms in optical lattices or
linear optical systems.

for exact quantum mechanical calculations that are based on Bohmian mechanics.
As part of this effort we have recently developed as alternative formulation of
Bohmian mechanics in which the quantum action, S, is taken to be complex [JCP
{125}, 231103 (2006)]. In the alternative formulation there is a significant
reduction in the magnitude of the quantum force as compared with the
conventional Bohmian formulation, at the price of propagating complex
trajectories. In this paper we show that Bohmian mechanics with complex action
is able to overcome the main computational limitation of conventional Bohmian
methods -- the propagation of wavefunctions once nodes set in. In the vicinity
of nodes, the quantum force in conventional Bohmian formulations exhibits rapid
oscillations that pose severe difficulties for existing numerical schemes. We
show that within complex Bohmian mechanics, multiple complex initial conditions
can lead to the same real final position, allowing for the description of nodes
as a sum of the contribution from two or more crossing trajectories. The idea
is illustrated on the reflection amplitude from a one-dimensional Eckart
barrier. We believe that trajectory crossing, although in contradiction to the
conventional Bohmian trajectory interpretation, provides an important new tool
for dealing with the nodal problem in Bohmian methods.

$\psi=e^{\frac{iS}{\hbar}}$ where the action, $S$, is taken to be complex and
the quantum force is obtained by writing a hierarchy of equations of motion for

article a solution of the question is proposed on the basis of a realistic
explanation of quantum mechanics. The explanation implies that the tunneling
particle has a certain chance to borrow enough energy from self-interference to
high-jump over the barrier. The root-mean-square velocity and the effective
tunneling time of an electron tunneling through a rectangular barrier are
numerically calculated. No superluminal effect (Hartman effect) is found for
the tunneling electron. Heisenberg's energy-time uncertainty relation for the
tunneling effect is verified by calculating an introduced coefficient
representing uncertainty. The present author argues that phase time, dwell time

  superconducting circuits</title><description>  Superconducting circuits are among the leading contenders for quantum
information processing. This promising avenue has been strengthened with the
advent of circuit quantum electrodynamics, underlined by recent experiments
coupling on-chip microwave resonators to superconducting qubits. However,
moving towards more qubits will require suitable novel architectures. Here, we
propose a scalable setup for quantum computing where such resonators are
arranged in a two-dimensional grid with a qubit at each intersection. Its
versatility allows any two qubits on the grid to be coupled at a swapping
overhead independent of their distance and yields an optimal balance between
reducing qubit transition frequency spread and spurious cavity-induced
couplings. These features make this setup unique and distinct from existing
proposals in ion traps, optical lattices, or semiconductor spins. We
demonstrate that this approach encompasses the fundamental elements of a
scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture.

reduced density matrix of a system for a number of situations of practical
importance, as the system evolves under the influence of its environment,
interacting via a quantum nondemoliton type of coupling, such that there is
decoherence without dissipation, as well as when it interacts via a dissipative
interaction, resulting in decoherence as well as dissipation. The system is
taken to be either a two-level atom (or equivalently, a spin-1/2 system) or a
harmonic oscillator, and the environment is modeled as a bath of harmonic
oscillators, starting out in a squeezed thermal state. The impact of the
different environmental parameters on the dynamics of the quantum phase
distribution for the system starting out in various initial states, is
explicitly brought out. An interesting feature that emerges from our work is
that the relationship between squeezing and temperature effects depends on the
type of system-bath interaction. In the case of quantum nondemolition type of
interaction, squeezing and temperature work in tandem, producing a diffusive
effect on the phase distribution. In contrast, in case of a dissipative
interaction, the influence of temperature can be counteracted by squeezing,
which manifests as a resistence to randomization of phase. We make use of the
phase distributions to bring out a notion of complementarity in atomic systems.
We also study the dispersion of the phase using the phase distributions
conditioned on particular initial states of the system.

final quantum state and then back to the initial state, i.e., making a round
trip along the great circle over S^2, must have a lower bound in quantum
mechanics, if the difference between two eigenstates of the 2\times 2
Hamiltonian is kept fixed. Even the non-hermitian quantum mechanics can not
reduce it to arbitrarily small value. In fact, we show that whether one uses a
hermitian Hamiltonian or a non-hermitian, the required minimal total time of
evolution is same. It is argued that in hermitian quantum mechanics the
condition for minimal time evolution can be understood as a constraint coming
from the orthogonality of the polarization vector \bf P of the evolving quantum
state \rho={1/2}(\bf 1+ \bf{P}\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}) with the vector
\boldsymbol{\mathcal O}(\Theta) of the 2\times 2 hermitian Hamiltonians H

O}(\Theta)\cdot\boldsymbol{\sigma}) and it is shown that the Hamiltonian H can
be parameterized by two independent parameters {\mathcal O}_0 and \Theta.

a class of two-mode squeezed Bell-like states with one-parameter dependence for

two-mode squeezed vacuum and the, suitably measured, amount of non-Gaussianity.

compact expression for the time reversal of a quantum operation, which is
closely analogous to the time reversal of a classical Markov transition matrix.
Since open quantum dynamics are stochastic, and not, in general, deterministic,
the time reversal is not, in general, an inversion of the dynamics. Rather, the
system relaxes towards equilibrium in both the forward and reverse time

in spite of apparent complexity of the potential, a quantum spectral problem

corresponding classical Hamiltonian system can be treated as a gauge system,
with imaginary part of the Hamiltonian playing the role of the first class
constraint. We observe then that, on the basis of this classical problem,
several different nontrivial quantum problems can be formulated. We formulate
and solve some such problems. We find in particular that the spectrum of the
mixed Hamiltonian undergoes in certain cases rather amazing transformation when
the coupling g is sent to zero. There is an infinite set of phase transitions
in g when a couple of eigenstates of H coalesce and disappear from the
spectrum. When quantization is done in the most natural way such that gauge
constraints are imposed on quantum states, the spectrum should not be positive
definite, but must involve the negative energy states (ghosts). We speculate
that, in spite of the appearance of ghost states, unitarity might still be

Schrodinger cat type states should collapse on measurable time scales when
masses and lengths of the order of bacterial scales are involved. We analyze
this hypothesis in the context of modern developments in condensed matter and
cold atoms physics, aimed at realizing macroscopic quantum states. We first
consider 'micromechanical' quantum states, analyzing the capacity of an atomic
force microscopy based single spin detector to measure the gravitational state
reduction, but we conclude that it seems impossible to suppress environmental
decoherence to the required degree. We subsequently discuss 'split' cold atom
condensates to find out that these are at present lacking the required mass
scale by many orders of magnitude. We then extent Penrose's analysis to
superpositions of mass current carrying states, and we apply this to the flux
quantum bits realized in superconducting circuits. We find that the flux qubits
approach the scale where gravitational state reduction should become

conditions, this implies that the ``parabosons of order p'' correspond to a
unitary irreducible (infinite-dimensional) lowest weight representation V(p) of
osp(1|2n). Apart from the simple cases p=1 or n=1, these representations had
never been constructed due to computational difficulties, despite their
importance. In the present paper we give an explicit and elegant construction
of these representations V(p), and we present explicit actions or matrix
elements of the osp(1|2n) generators. The orthogonal basis vectors of V(p) are
written in terms of Gelfand-Zetlin patterns, where the subalgebra u(n) of
osp(1|2n) plays a crucial role. Our results also lead to character formulas for
these infinite-dimensional osp(1|2n) representations. Furthermore, by
considering the branching $ osp(1|2n) \supset sp(2n) \supset u(n)$, we find
explicit infinite-dimensional unitary irreducible lowest weight representations
of sp(2n) and their characters.

show that the high amplitude limit, when performed on the moment operators,

under some natural conditions (each of which is satisfied by the homodyne

entanglement of two or more distant particles. Although questions regarding
fundamental issues of quantum theory still exist, quantum entanglement has
started to play important roles in practical engineering applications. Quantum
imaging is one of these exciting areas. Quantum imaging has demonstrated two
peculiar features: (1) reproducing &quot;ghost&quot; images in a &quot;nonlocal&quot; manner, and
(2) enhancing the spatial resolution of imaging beyond the diffraction limit.
In this article, we start with the review of classical imaging to establish the
basic concepts and formalisms of imaging. We then analyze two-photon imaging
with particular emphasis on the physics of spatial resolution enhancement and
the &quot;ghost&quot; imaging phenomenon.

been suggested as an interesting alternative to single photon optical quantum
computing with lower physical resource overheads. These proposals have been
questioned as a practical way of performing quantum computing in the short term
due to the requirement of generating fragile diagonal states with large
coherent amplitudes. Here we show that by using a fault-tolerant error
correction scheme, one need only use relatively small coherent state amplitudes
($\alpha &gt; 1.2$) to achieve universal quantum computing. We study the effects
of small coherent state amplitude and photon loss on fault tolerance within the

than the best known single photon scheme. %We study this reigem using a Monte

transition systems. Strong bisimulation between processes modeled in qCCS is
defined, and its fundamental algebraic properties are established, including
uniqueness of the solutions of recursive equations. To model sequential
computation in qCCS, a reduction relation between processes is defined. By
combining reduction relation and strong bisimulation we introduce the notion of
strong reduction-bisimulation, which is a device for observing interaction of
computation and communication in quantum systems. Finally, a notion of strong
approximate bisimulation (equivalently, strong bisimulation distance) and its
reduction counterpart are introduced. It is proved that both approximate
bisimilarity and approximate reduction-bisimilarity are preserved by various
constructors of quantum processes. This provides us with a formal tool for
observing robustness of quantum processes against inaccuracy in the

important developments in the foundations of physics. It has even been
described as &quot;the most profound discovery of science.&quot; Yet even as we approach
the 50th anniversary of Bell's discovery, its meaning and implications remain
controversial. Many textbooks and commentators report that Bell's theorem
refutes the possibility (suggested especially by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen
in 1935) of supplementing ordinary quantum theory with additional (&quot;hidden&quot;)
variables that might restore determinism and/or some notion of an
observer-independent reality. On this view, Bell's theorem supports the
orthodox Copenhagen interpretation. Bell's own view of his theorem, however,
was quite different. He instead took the theorem as establishing an &quot;essential
conflict&quot; between the now well-tested empirical predictions of quantum theory
and relativistic \emph{local causality}. The goal of the present paper is, in
general, to make Bell's own views more widely known and, in particular, to
explain in detail Bell's little-known mathematical formulation of the concept
of relativistic local causality on which his theorem rests. We thus collect and
organize many of Bell's crucial statements on these topics, which are scattered
throughout his writings, into a self-contained, pedagogical discussion
including elaborations of the concepts &quot;beable&quot;, &quot;completeness&quot;, and
&quot;causality&quot; which figure in the formulation. We also show how local causality
(as formulated by Bell) can be used to derive an empirically testable Bell-type
inequality, and how it can be used to recapitulate the EPR argument.

covariant under the same group. This is done for damped harmonic oscillator,
two-level system and quantum Brownian motion. Special attention is devoted to
the general structure of translation-covariant master equations. Within this

significant obstacle in this direction is the problem of &quot;decoherence&quot;: the
extreme fragility of quantum systems to environmental noise and other control
limitations. The theory of fault-tolerant quantum error correction has shown
that quantum computation is possible even in the presence of decoherence
provided that the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain
well-defined theoretical conditions. However, existing methods for noise
characterisation have become intractable already for the systems that are

symmetrisation that enables direct experimental characterisation of key

encode a multipartite classical probability distribution, i.e. does not
describe the joint state of many classical registers. Even unentangled states
may exhibit such \emph{quantumness}, that is pointed out by the new task of
\emph{local broadcasting}, i.e. of locally sharing pre-established
correlations: this task is feasible if and only if correlations are classical

local broadcasting is able to point out the quantumness of correlations, as
standard broadcasting points out the quantum character of single system states.
Further, we argue that our theorem implies the standard no-broadcasting theorem

undergoes a dissipative (i.e., an apparently irreversible) process that leads
to thermal equilibrium. This dynamical process can be described fully within
quantum physics, involving only unitary, therefore reversible, maps. The
information, initially present in the system, is not erased, but is diluted in
the bath because of entanglement. Irreversibility may arise if, after quantum
information has been thus diluted, some classical information is lost. This
paper reviews a model for thermalization that displays these features. Two new
analytical results are provided for the zero-temperature channels: a new
quantitative measure of entanglement, and a study of irreversibility in the
case where the lost classical information is the label of the particles in the
bath.

gates can be implemented with sufficiently low error. One method for
determining the error behavior of a gate implementation is to perform process
tomography. However, standard process tomography is limited by errors in state
preparation, measurement and one-qubit gates. It suffers from inefficient
scaling with number of qubits and does not detect adverse error-compounding
when gates are composed in long sequences. An additional problem is due to the
fact that desirable error probabilities for scalable quantum computing are of
the order of 0.0001 or lower. Experimentally proving such low errors is
challenging. We describe a randomized benchmarking method that yields estimates
of the computationally relevant errors without relying on accurate state
preparation and measurement. Since it involves long sequences of randomly
chosen gates, it also verifies that error behavior is stable when used in long
computations. We implemented randomized benchmarking on trapped atomic ion
qubits, establishing a one-qubit error probability per randomized pi/2 pulse of
0.00482(17) in a particular experiment. We expect this error probability to be
readily improved with straightforward technical modifications.

two-dimensional systems. In one dimension, fractional statistics has been
established so far only through Haldane's fractional exclusion principle, but
not via a fractional phase the wave function acquires as particles are
interchanged. At first sight, the topology of the configuration space appears
to preclude such phases in one dimension. Here we argue that the crossings of
one-dimensional anyons are always unidirectional, which makes it possible to
assign phases consistently and hence to introduce a statistical parameter
theta. The fractional statistics then manifests itself in fractional spacings
of the single-particle momenta of the anyons when periodic boundary conditions
are imposed. These spacings are given by Delta p = 2 pi hbar/L
(|theta|/pi+non-negative integer) for a system of length L. This condition is
the analogue of the quantisation of relative angular momenta according to
l_z=hbar(-theta/pi+2integer) for two-dimensional anyons.

when the recoil frequency is much smaller than the trapping frequency

supposed to be unaffected by vibronic transitions in which the vibrational
number changes. While this is strictly true in the Lamb-Dicke limit (infinitely
tight confinement), the vibronic transitions do play a role in the Lamb-Dicke
regime. In this paper we quantify the asymptotic behaviour of their effect with
respect to the Lamb-Dicke parameter. In particular, we give analytical

the carrier absorption band by the vibronic transitions both for Rabi and
Ramsey schemes. This shift is shown to be independent of the initial

that preserve its other desirable properties such as locality, separability,
conservation of probability and Poincar\'e invariance. We determine the
constraints that the nonlinear term must obey and classify the resultant
non-polynomial nonlinearities in a double expansion in the degree of
nonlinearity and number of derivatives. We give explicit examples of such
nonlinear equations, studying their discrete symmetries and other properties.
Motivated by some previously suggested applications we then consider nonlinear
terms that simultaneously violate Lorentz covariance and again study various
explicit examples. We contrast our equations and construction procedure with
others in the literature and also show that our equations are not gauge
equivalent to the linear Dirac equation. Finally we outline various physical
applications for these equations.

application of quantum information theory to communication complexity. To
demonstrate this phenomenon researchers in the field of quantum communication
complexity devised a number of quantum non-locality games. The setting of these
games is as follows: the players are separated so that no communication between
them is possible and are given a certain computational task. When the players
have access to a quantum resource called entanglement, they can accomplish the
task: something that is impossible in a classical setting. To an observer who
is unfamiliar with the laws of quantum mechanics it seems that the players
employ some sort of telepathy; that is, they somehow exchange information
without sharing a communication channel. This paper provides a formal framework
for specifying, implementing, and analysing quantum non-locality games.

magnetic field strengths where the Larmor frequency of the nucleus is
comparable to the hyperfine coupling strength. The quantization axis for the
nuclear spin differs from the static B_0 field direction and depends on the
state of the electron spin. The quantization axis can be switched by flipping
the state of electron spin, allowing for universal control on nuclear spin
states. We show that by performing a sequence of flips (each followed by a
suitable delay), we can perform any desired rotation on the nuclear spins,
which can also be conditioned on the state of the electron spin. These
operations, combined with electron spin rotations can be used to synthesize any
unitary transformation on the coupled electron-nuclear spin system. We discuss
how these methods can be used for design of experiments for transfer of
polarization from the electron to the nuclear spins.

  membrane</title><description>  Macroscopic mechanical objects and electromagnetic degrees of freedom couple
to each other via radiation pressure. Optomechanical systems with sufficiently
strong coupling are predicted to exhibit quantum effects and are a topic of
considerable interest. Devices reaching this regime would offer new types of
control of the quantum state of both light and matter and would provide a new
arena in which to explore the boundary between quantum and classical physics.
Experiments to date have achieved sufficient optomechanical coupling to
laser-cool mechanical devices but have not yet reached the quantum regime. The
outstanding technical challenge in this field is integrating sensitive
micromechanical elements (which must be small, light, and flexible) into high
finesse cavities (which are typically much more rigid and massive) without
compromising the mechanical or optical properties of either. A second, and more
fundamental, challenge is to read out the mechanical element's quantum state:
displacement measurements (no matter how sensitive) cannot determine the energy
eigenstate of an oscillator, and measurements which couple to quantities other
than displacement have been difficult to realize. Here we present a novel
optomechanical system which seems to resolve both these challenges. We
demonstrate a cavity which is detuned by the motion of a thin dielectric
membrane placed between two macroscopic, rigid, high-finesse mirrors. This
approach segregates optical and mechanical functionality to physically distinct
structures and avoids compromising either. It also allows for direct
measurement of the square of the membrane's displacement, and thus in principle
the membrane's energy eigenstate. We estimate it should be practical to use
this scheme to observe quantum jumps of a mechanical system.

as sophisticated pulse shaping experiments allow to coherently control product

transfer an initial state to a given final state can be achieved with the help
of quantum optimal control theory (QOCT). This tutorial provides an

explain the most successful schemes to solve these control equations and show
how to incorporate additional constraints in the pulse design. The algorithms

Specifically, we consider Hamiltonians of the form $H=H_0+\epsilon V$, where
H_0 describes non-interacting qubits, V is a perturbation that involves
arbitrary two-qubit interactions on a graph of bounded degree, and $\epsilon$
is a small parameter. The algorithm works if $|\epsilon|$ is below a certain
threshold value that depends only upon the spectral gap of H_0, the maximal

state using radiation pressure in an appropriately detuned cavity
(self-cooling). From a simple theory based on Heisenberg-Langevin equations we
find that optimal self-cooling occurs in the good cavity regime, when the
cavity bandwidth is smaller than the mechanical frequency, but still larger
than the effective mechanical damping. In this case the intracavity field and
the vibrational mechanical mode coherently exchange their fluctuations. We also
present dynamical calculations which show how to access the mirror final
temperature from the fluctuations of the field reflected by the cavity.

The resulting decoherence originates completely from the dynamics of the system

  Orthonormal Bases and Minimum-Uncertainty States</title><description>  Since Renes et al. [J. Math. Phys. 45, 2171 (2004)], there has been much
effort in the quantum information community to prove (or disprove) the
existence of symmetric informationally complete (SIC) sets of quantum states in
arbitrary finite dimension. This paper strengthens the urgency of this question
by showing that if SIC-sets exist: 1) by a natural measure of orthonormality,
they are as close to being an orthonormal basis for the space of density
operators as possible, and 2) in prime dimensions, the standard construction
for complete sets of mutually unbiased bases and Weyl-Heisenberg covariant
SIC-sets are intimately related: The latter represent minimum uncertainty
states for the former in the sense of Wootters and Sussman. Finally, we
contribute to the question of existence by conjecturing a quadratic redundancy
in the equations for Weyl-Heisenberg SIC-sets.

This condition, verified by generic PEPS and examples like the AKLT model, is

While it implies the existence of an energy gap in the 1D case we will show
that in certain cases (e.g., on a 2D hexagonal lattice) the parent Hamiltonian

functional theory in the coherent-state representation, we derive an exact
master equation with time-dependent coefficients reflecting the non-Markovian
influence of the environment. The influence of environments with different
spectral densities, e.g., Ohmic, sub-Ohmic, and super-Ohmic, is numerically
studied. The non-Markovian process shows its remarkable influences on the
entanglement dynamics due to the sensitive time-dependence of the dissipation

environment shows a weak dissipation-noise effect on the entanglement dynamics,
while the sub-Ohmic and super-Ohmic environments induce much more severe noise.
In particular, the memory of the system interacting with the environment
contributes a strong decoherence effect to the entanglement dynamics in the
super-Ohmic case.

the nature of the adsorbate-substrate and the substrate-substrate interactions.
In particular, the experimental broadening observed in the diffusive peak with
increasing coverage is usually interpreted in terms of a dipole-dipole like
interaction among adsorbates via extensive molecular dynamics calculations
within the Langevin framework. Here we present an alternative way to interpret
this broadening by means of a purely stochastic description, namely the
interacting single adsorbate approximation, where two noise sources are
considered: (1) a Gaussian white noise accounting for the surface friction and
temperature, and (2) a white shot noise replacing the interaction potential
between adsorbates. Standard Langevin numerical simulations for flat and
corrugated surfaces (with a separable potential) illustrate the dynamics of Na
atoms on a Cu(100) surface which fit fairly well to the analytical expressions
issued from simple models (free particle and anharmonic oscillator) when the
Gaussian approximation is assumed. A similar broadening is also expected for

entropy is an automorphic function with respect to a certain subgroup of the
modular group; moreover, the subgroup depends on whether the magnetic field is

This hole is manifested by a void in the pair wavefunction and a momentum kick.
Photoassociation into loosely bound levels of the external well in Cs_2
0$_g^-$(6S + 6P$_{3/2}$ is considered as a case study. After the pulse, the
free evolution of the ground triplet state wavepacket is analyzed. Due to a
negative momentum kick, motion to small distances is manifested and a
compression effect is pointed out, markedly increasing the density of atom
pairs at short distance. A consequence of the hole is the redistribution of the
vibrational population in the ground triplet state, with population of the last
bound level and creation of pairs of hot atoms. The physical interpretation
makes use of the time dependence of the probability current and population on
each channel to understand the role of the parameters of the photoassociation
pulse. By varying such parameters, optimization of the compression effect in
the ground state wavepacket is demonstrated. Due to an increase of the short
range density probability by more than two orders of magnitude, we predict
important photoassociation rates into deeply bound levels of the excited state
by a second pulse, red-detuned relative to the first one and conveniently

fluctuations of the zero point field may lead to a breakdown of the
superluminal quantum correlations over very large distances. A phenomenological
model that was proposed by Winterberg to estimate the transition scale of the
conjectured breakdown, does not lead to a distance that is large enough to be
agreeable with recent experiments. We consider, but rule out, the possibility
of a steeper slope in the energy spectrum of the turbulent fluctuations, due to
compressibility, as a possible mechanism that may lead to an increased
lower-bound for the transition scale. Instead, we argue that Winterberg
overestimated the intensity of the ZPF turbulent fluctuations. We calculate a
very generous corrected lower bound for the transition distance which is
consistent with current experiments.

This protocol is a multiparty version of the fully quantum Slepian-Wolf

for the plat closure of a braid is a BQP-complete problem. That is, this
problem exactly captures the power of the quantum circuit model. The one clean
qubit model is a model of quantum computation in which all but one qubit starts
in the maximally mixed state. One clean qubit computers are believed to be
strictly weaker than standard quantum computers, but still capable of solving
some classically intractable problems. Here we show that evaluating a certain

closure of a braid is a complete problem for the one clean qubit complexity

polynomials in time polynomial in both the number of strands and number of

reducible to approximating the Jones polynomial of the trace closure of a

measuring the sign of two local quadratures. On Gaussian states, such `bit
quadrature correlations' majorize entanglement, reducing to an entanglement
monotone for pure states. For non-Gaussian states, such as photonic Bell
states, ideal and real de-Gaussified photon-subtracted states, and mixtures of
pure Gaussian states, the bit correlations are shown to be a {\em monotonic}
function of the negativity. This yields a feasible, operational way to
quantitatively measure non-Gaussian entanglement in current experiments by
means of direct homodyne detection, without a full tomographical reconstruction
of the Wigner function.

construct quantum games. In our framework a game attains classical
interpretation when joint probabilities are factorizable and a quantum game
corresponds when these probabilities cannot be factorized. We analyze how
non-factorizability changes Nash equilibria in two-player games while
considering the games of Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt, and Chicken. In this

EPR joint probabilities cannot be helpful to escape from the classical outcome
of the game. For a particular version of the Chicken game, however, we find
that the two non-factorizable sets of joint probabilities, that maximally

after a sudden displacement of the trap minimum is monitored for different
interaction strengths and lattice fillings. With increasingly strong attractive
interactions the weakly damped oscillation, observed for the non-interacting
case, turns into a slow relaxational drift. Tuning the interaction strength
during the evolution allows us to dynamically control the transport behavior.
Strong attraction between the atoms leads to the formation of local pairs with
a reduced tunneling rate. The interpretation in terms of pair formation is
supported by a measurement of the number of doubly occupied lattice sites. This
quantity also allows us to determine the temperature of the non-interacting gas
in the lattice to be as low as (27\pm2)% of the Fermi temperature.

  Potentials</title><description>  We highlight the conceptual issues that arise when one applies the
quasi-Hermitian framework to analyze scattering from localized non-Hermitian
potentials, in particular complex square-wells or delta-functions. When treated
in the framework of conventional quantum mechanics, these potentials are
generally considered as effective theories, in which probability is not
conserved because of processes that have been ignored. However, if they are
treated as fundamental theories, the Hilbert-space metric must be changed. In
order for the newly-defined probability to be conserved, it must differ from
the standard one, even at asymptotically large distances from the scattering
centre, and the mechanism for this is the non-locality of the new metric, as we
show in detail in the model of a single complex delta function. However,
properties of distant bound-state systems, which do not interact physically
with the non-Hermitian scattering potential, should not be affected. We analyze
a model Hamiltonian that supports this contention.

  Laws: Extension of the Wigner-Araki-Yanase Theorem</title><description>  The Wigner-Araki-Yanase (WAY) theorem shows that additive conservation laws
limit the accuracy of measurements. Recently, various quantitative expressions
have been found for quantum limits on measurements induced by additive
conservation laws, and have been applied to the study of fundamental limits on
quantum information processing. Here, we investigate generalizations of the WAY
theorem to multiplicative conservation laws. The WAY theorem is extended to
show that an observable not commuting with the modulus of, or equivalently the
square of, a multiplicatively conserved quantity cannot be precisely measured.
We also obtain a lower bound for the mean-square noise of a measurement in the
presence of a multiplicatively conserved quantity. To overcome this noise it is
necessary to make large the coefficient of variation (the so-called relative
fluctuation), instead of the variance as is the case for additive conservation
laws, of the conserved quantity in the apparatus.

juntas, i.e. Boolean functions which depend only on an unknown set of k out of
n input variables. Our aim is to develop efficient algorithms:
  - whose sample complexity has no dependence on n, the dimension of the domain
the Boolean functions are defined over;
  - with no access to any classical or quantum membership (&quot;black-box&quot;)
queries. Instead, our algorithms use only classical examples generated
uniformly at random and fixed quantum superpositions of such classical
examples;
  - which require only a few quantum examples but possibly many classical
random examples (which are considered quite &quot;cheap&quot; relative to quantum
examples).
  Our quantum algorithms are based on a subroutine FS which enables sampling
according to the Fourier spectrum of f; the FS subroutine was used in earlier
work of Bshouty and Jackson on quantum learning. Our results are as follows:
  - We give an algorithm for testing k-juntas to accuracy $\epsilon$ that uses
$O(k/\epsilon)$ quantum examples. This improves on the number of examples used
by the best known classical algorithm.
  - We establish the following lower bound: any FS-based k-junta testing
algorithm requires $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ queries.
  - We give an algorithm for learning $k$-juntas to accuracy $\epsilon$ that
uses $O(\epsilon^{-1} k\log k)$ quantum examples and $O(2^k \log(1/\epsilon))$
random examples. We show that this learning algorithms is close to optimal by
giving a related lower bound.

promising arena to study strongly correlated systems. In experiments realizing
such mixtures in the quantum degenerate regime the temperature is a key
parameter. In this work, we investigate the intrinsic heating and cooling
effects due to an entropy-preserving raising of the optical lattice potential.
We analyze this process, identify the generic behavior valid for a wide range
of parameters, and discuss it quantitatively for the recent experiments with
87Rb and 40K atoms. In the absence of a lattice, we treat the bosons in the
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov-Popov-approximation, including the fermions in a
self-consistent mean field interaction. In the presence of the full
three-dimensional lattice, we use a strong coupling expansion. As a result of
the presence of the fermions, the temperature of the mixture after the lattice
ramp-up is always higher than for the pure bosonic case. This sheds light onto
a key point in the analysis of recent experiments.

quantum information processing (QIP). Whereas QIP has been demonstrated for a
few qubits in several systems, many technical difficulties must be overcome in
order to construct a large-scale device. In one proposal for large-scale QIP,
trapped ions are manipulated by precisely controlled light pulses and moved
through and stored in multizone trap arrays. The technical overhead necessary
to precisely control both the ion geometrical configurations and the laser
interactions is demanding. Here we propose methods that significantly reduce
the overhead on laser beam control for performing single and multiple qubit
operations on trapped ions. We show how a universal set of operations can be
implemented by controlled transport of ions through stationary laser beams. At
the same time, each laser beam can be used to perform many operations in
parallel, potentially reducing the total laser power necessary to carry out QIP
tasks. The overall setup necessary for implementing transport gates is simpler
than for gates executed on stationary ions. We also suggest a transport-based
two-qubit gate scheme utilizing microfabricated permanent magnets that can be
executed without laser light.

constraints admit polynomial-time upper bounds if the underlying graph has
small treewidth. The same problems often encourage reducing the maximal degree
of vertices to simplify theoretical arguments or address practical concerns.
Such degree reduction can be performed through a sequence of splittings of
vertices, resulting in an _expansion_ of the original graph. We observe that
the treewidth of a graph may increase dramatically if the splittings are not
performed carefully. In this context we address the following natural question:
is it possible to reduce the maximum degree to a constant without substantially
increasing the treewidth?
  Our work answers the above question affirmatively. We prove that any simple
undirected graph G=(V, E) admits an expansion G'=(V', E') with the maximum
degree &lt;= 3 and treewidth(G') &lt;= treewidth(G)+1. Furthermore, such an expansion
will have no more than 2|E|+|V| vertices and 3|E| edges; it can be computed
efficiently from a tree-decomposition of G. We also construct a family of
examples for which the increase by 1 in treewidth cannot be avoided.

equivalent structures on principal bundles, the general conditions for
equivalence of their Lagrangians have not been explicitly stated. In this paper
we address the conditions for equivalence. The formulation of these conditions
is based on previous work in which the Dirac and Einstein equations were
unified in a tetrad formulation of the Kaluza-Klein model. This Kaluza-Klein
model is derived from mapping a bispinor field to a set of SL(2,R) x U(1) gauge
potentials and a complex scalar field. (A straightforward derivation of this
map using Hestenes' tetrad for the spin connection in a Riemannian space-time
is included in this paper.) Investigation of this Kaluza-Klein model reveals
two general conditions for establishing an exact equivalence between
Kaluza-Klein and Yang-Mills theories. The first condition is that only
horizontal vector fields occur in the Kaluza-Klein Lagrangian. The second is
that the scalar curvature be restricted to a sum over horizontal sectional
curvatures. We conclude that all known fields (including fermion fields) can
then be represented as components of a Kaluza-Klein metric together with scalar
fields.

paper we focus our attention on pilot-wave theories in which the additional

for the free electromagnetic field. Since Bohm, similar pilot-wave theories
have been proposed for other quantum fields. The purpose of this paper is to
present an overview and further development of these proposals. We discuss
various bosonic quantum field theories such as the Schroedinger field, the free

We further discuss the proposals for fermionic fields by Holland and Valentini.
In the case of Holland's model we indicate that further work is required in

method of evaluating the coherent-state propagator is presented. It is found
that the cavity radiation exhibits squeezing which is directly attributed to
the squeezed radiation in the cavity. The intensity of the cavity radiation
increases with the squeeze parameter and interaction time. It is also shown

  system</title><description>  We formulate the accuracy of quantum measurement for a qubit system in terms
of a 3 by 3 matrix. This matrix, which we refer to as the accuracy matrix, can
be calculated from a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) corresponding to
the quantum measurement. Based on the accuracy matrix, we derive new trade-off
relations between the measurement accuracy of two or three noncommuting
observables of a qubit system. These trade-off relations offer a quantitative
information-theoretic representation of Bohr's principle of complementarity.
They can be interpreted as the uncertainty relations between measurement errors
in simultaneous measurements, and also as the trade-off relations between the
measurement error and back-action of measurement. A no-cloning inequality is
derived from the trade-off relations. Furthermore, our formulation and the
obtained results can be applied to analyze quantum state tomography. We also
show that the accuracy matrix is closely related to the maximum-likelihood
estimation and the Fisher information matrix for a finite number of samples;
the accuracy matrix tells us how accurately we can estimate the probability
distributions of observables of an unknown state by quantum measurement.

  counting</title><description>  The irreversible evolution of a microscopic system under measurement is a
central feature of quantum theory. From an initial state generally exhibiting
quantum uncertainty in the measured observable, the system is projected into a
state in which this observable becomes precisely known. Its value is random,
with a probability determined by the initial system's state. The evolution
induced by measurement (known as 'state collapse') can be progressive,
accumulating the effects of elementary state changes. Here we report the
observation of such a step-by-step collapse by measuring non-destructively the
photon number of a field stored in a cavity. Atoms behaving as microscopic
clocks cross the cavity successively. By measuring the light-induced
alterations of the clock rate, information is progressively extracted, until
the initially uncertain photon number converges to an integer. The suppression
of the photon number spread is demonstrated by correlations between repeated
measurements. The procedure illustrates all the postulates of quantum
measurement (state collapse, statistical results and repeatability) and should
facilitate studies of non-classical fields trapped in cavities.

distribution system containing such detectors. In this regime, all single
photon detectors in the receiver Bob are uniformly blinded by continuous
illumination coming from the eavesdropper Eve. When Eve needs a certain
detector in Bob to produce a click, she modifies polarization (or other
parameter used to encode quantum states) of the light she sends to Bob such
that the target detector stops receiving light while the other detector(s)
continue to be illuminated. The target detector regains single photon
sensitivity and, when Eve modifies the polarization again, produces a single
click. Thus, Eve has full control of Bob and can do a successful
intercept-resend attack. To check the feasibility of the attack, 3 different

constitutes one of the hallmark effects of quantum physics. When interactions
between the particles compete with their mobility through a tunnel junction,
intriguing novel dynamical behaviour can arise where particles do not tunnel
independently. In single-electron or Bloch transistors, for example, the
tunnelling of an electron or Cooper pair can be enabled or suppressed by the
presence of a second charge carrier due to Coulomb blockade. Here we report on
the first direct and time-resolved observation of correlated tunnelling of two
interacting atoms through a barrier in a double well potential. We show that
for weak interactions between the atoms and dominating tunnel coupling,
individual atoms can tunnel independently, similar to the case in a normal
Josephson junction. With strong repulsive interactions present, two atoms
located on one side of the barrier cannot separate, but are observed to tunnel
together as a pair in a second order co-tunnelling process. By recording both
the atom position and phase coherence over time, we fully characterize the
tunnelling process for a single atom as well as the correlated dynamics of a
pair of atoms for weak and strong interactions. In addition, we identify a
conditional tunnelling regime, where a single atom can only tunnel in the
presence of a second particle, acting as a single atom switch. Our work
constitutes the first direct observation of second order tunnelling events with
ultracold atoms, which are the dominating dynamical effect in the strongly
interacting regime. Similar second-order processes form the basis of
superexchange interactions between atoms on neighbouring lattice sites of a
periodic potential, a central component of quantum magnetism.

that every two stabilizer states which are related by a local unitary
operation, must also be related by a local operation within the Clifford group.
The contribution of this paper is a reduction of the LU-LC conjecture to a

we show that, if the LU-LC conjecture could be proved for the restricted case

totality. Furthermore, the reduced version of the problem, involving such
diagonal local operations, is mapped to questions regarding quadratic forms
over the finite field GF(2). Finally, we prove that correctness of the LU-LC
conjecture for stabilizer states implies a similar result for the more general

it must also satisfy the known entropic inequalities. Now the questions arises
whether on the assumption that stronger criteria based on positive but not
completely positive maps are satisfied, it is possible to derive some scalar
inequalities stronger than the entropic ones. In this paper we show that under
some assumptions the extended reduction criterion [H.-P. Breuer, Phys. Rev.
Lett 97, 080501 (2006); W. Hall, J. Phys. A 40, 6183 (2007)] leads to some
entropic--like inequalities which are much stronger than their entropic
counterparts. The comparison of the derived inequalities with other
separability criteria shows that such approach might lead to strong scalar
criteria detecting both distillable and bound entanglement. In particular, in
the case of SO(3)-invariant states it is shown that the present inequalities
detect entanglement in regions in which entanglement witnesses based on
extended reduction map fail. It should be also emphasized that in the case of
$2\otimes N$ states the derived inequalities detect entanglement efficiently,
while the extended reduction maps are useless when acting on the qubit

there is a possibility of experimental realization. Some open problems and

  quantum impurity: an outline of exact and complete solutions</title><description>  We consider the transport properties of multiple-particle quantum states in a
class of one-dimensional systems with a single quantum impurity. In these
systems, the local interaction at the quantum impurity induces strong and
non-trivial correlations between the multi-particles. We outline an exact
theoretical approach, based upon real-space equations of motion and the Bethe
ansatz, that allows one to construct the full scattering matrix (S-matrix) for
these systems. In particular, we emphasize the need for completeness check upon
the eigenstates of the S-matrix, when these states obtained from Bethe Ansatz
are used for describing the scattering properties. As a detailed example of our
approach, we solve the transport properties of two photons incident on a single
two-level atom, when the photons are restricted to a one-dimensional system
such as a photonic crystal waveguide. Our approach predicts a number of novel
nonlinear effects involving only two photons, including background
fluorescence, spatial attraction and repulsion between the photons, as well as
the emergence of a two-photon bound state.

  properties with light</title><description>  The experimental demonstration of the modification of the Casimir force
between a gold coated sphere and a single-crystal Si membrane by light pulses
is performed. The specially designed and fabricated Si membrane was irradiated
with 514 nm laser pulses of 5 ms width in high vacuum leading to a change of
the charge-carrier density. The difference in the Casimir force in the presence
and in the absence of laser radiation was measured by means of an atomic force
microscope as a function of separation at different powers of the absorbed
light. The total experimental error of the measured force differences at a
separation of 100 nm varies from 10 to 20% in different measurements. The
experimental results are compared with theoretical computations using the
Lifshitz theory at both zero and laboratory temperatures. The total theoretical
error determined mostly by the uncertainty in the concentration of charge
carriers when the light is incident is found to be about 14% at separations
less than 140 nm. The experimental data are consistent with the Lifshitz theory
at laboratory temperature, if the static dielectric permittivity of
high-resistivity Si in the absence of light is assumed to be finite. If the dc
conductivity of high-resistivity Si in the absence of light is included into
the model of dielectric response, the Lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature is
shown to be experimentally inconsistent at 95% confidence. The demonstrated
phenomenon of the modification of the Casimir force through a change of the
charge-carrier density is topical for applications of the Lifshitz theory to
real materials in fields ranging from nanotechnology and condensed matter
physics to the theory of fundamental interactions.

this paper we address a question whether local operations (without classical

arbitrary unilocal channel (i.e., a channel that acts on one sub-system of a

singularity that would prevent the particles from falling into the singularity,
in the case we are interested in here particles have positive probability to
hit the singularity and get annihilated. The wish for reversibility,
equivariance and the Markov property then dictate that particles must also be
created by the singularity, and indeed dictate the rate at which this must

We specify explicit model equations, involving a boundary condition on the wave

interaction is quenched at a slow but uniform rate. The two quenching schemes
are called transverse and anisotropic quenching respectively. Our emphasis in
this paper is on the anisotropic quenching scheme and we compare the results
with those of the other scheme. In the process of anisotropic quenching, the
system crosses all the quantum critical lines of the phase diagram where the
relaxation time diverges. The evolution is non-adiabatic in the time interval
when the parameters are close to their critical values, and is adiabatic
otherwise. The density of defects produced due to non-adiabatic transitions is
calculated by mapping the many-particle system to an equivalent Landau-Zener
problem and is generally found to vary as $1/\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the
characteristic time scale of quenching, a scenario that supports the
Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Interestingly, in the case of anisotropic quenching,
there exists an additional non-adiabatic transition, in comparison to the
transverse quenching case, with the corresponding probability peaking at an
incommensurate value of the wave vector. In the special case in which the
system passes through a multi-critical point, the defect density is found to
vary as $1/\tau^{1/6}$. The von Neumann entropy of the final state is shown to
maximize at a quenching rate around which the ordering of the final state

response function determines the ability of the physical system to generate
genuine quantum correlations between the probes. We show that the biquadratic
Heisenberg spin-1 chain is able to produce LDE in the thermodynamical limit and

number, in the presence of a Kerr nonlinearity, exhibits BEC if the transfer
amplitude is greater than the mode frequency. A symmetry-breaking field (SBF)
can be introduced by taking into account a classical electron current. The
ground state, in the limit of small nonlinearity, becomes a squeezed state, and
thus the modes become entangled. The smaller is the SBF, the greater is
entanglement. Superfluid-like behavior is observed in the study of entanglement
growth from an initial coherent state, since in the short-time range the growth
does not depend on the SBF amplitude, and on the initial state amplitude. On
the other hand, the latter is the only parameter which determines entanglement
in the absence of the SBF.

Dirac-Einstein Lagrangian. In this model, Dirac's bispinor equation is obtained
in the limit for which the radius of higher compact dimensions of the

splitting of single fermion wave packets. That is, the model predicts a single
fermion wave packet will split into two wave packets with slightly different
group velocities. Observation of such wave packet splits would determine the
size of the Kaluza-Klein radius. If wave packet splits were not observed in
experiments with currently achievable accuracies, the Kaluza-Klein radius would

spin only (one cannot unambiguously ascribe a spin to a QD) and the system
state is fully described by the spin-density matrix. Accounting for the spatial
degrees of freedom, we examine to what extent a Hamiltonian description of the
spin-only degrees of freedom is valid. We show that as long as there is no
coupling between singlet and triplet states this is indeed the case, but when
there is such a coupling there are open systems effects, i.e., the dynamics is
non-unitary even without interaction with a true bath. Our primary focus is an
investigation of non-unitary effects, based on exact master equations we derive

through a single-mode cavity. The interaction of an atom with the cavity field
allows the atom to make a transition from the upper most (lower most) to the
lower most (upper most) level by emission (absoprtion) of two photons via the
middle level. We employ an effective Hamiltonian that describes the system with
a Stark shifted two-photon atomic transition. We compute the entanglement of
formation of the joint two-atom state as a function of Rabi angle $gt$. It is
shown that the Stark shift can be used to enhance the magnitude of atomic
entanglement over that obtained in the resonant condition for certain parameter
values. We find that though the two-atom entanglement generally diminishes with
the increase of the two-photon detuning and the Stark shift, it is possible to
sustain the entanglement over a range of interaction times by making the
detuning and the Stark shift compensate each other. Similar characteristics are
obtained for a thermal state cavity field too.

  theory</title><description>  The monochromatic Dirac and polychromatic Titulaer-Glauber quantized field
theories (QFTs) of electromagnetism are derived from a photon-energy wave
function in much the same way that one derives QFT for electrons, that is, by
quantization of a single-particle wave function. The photon wave function and
its equation of motion are established from the Einstein energy-momentum-mass
relation, assuming a local energy density. This yields a theory of photon wave
mechanics (PWM). The proper Lorentz-invariant single-photon scalar product is
found to be non-local in coordinate space, and is shown to correspond to
orthogonalization of the Titulaer-Glauber wave-packet modes. The wave functions
of PWM and mode functions of QFT are shown to be equivalent, evolving via
identical equations of motion, and completely describe photonic states. We
generalize PWM to two or more photons, and show how to switch between the PWM
and QFT viewpoints. The second-order coherence tensors of classical coherence
theory and the two-photon wave functions are shown to propagate equivalently.
We give examples of beam-like states, which can be used as photon wave
functions in PWM, or modes in QFT. We propose a practical mode converter based
on spectral filtering to convert between wave packets and their corresponding
biorthogonal dual wave packets.

demonstrate this technique as an efficient means to accomplish broadband
dipolar recoupling of homonuclear spins, while decoupling heteronuclear dipolar
couplings and anisotropic chemicals shifts and retaining influence from
isotropic chemical shifts. In this manner, it possible to synthesize Ising
interactions in homonuclear spin networks and thereby avoid dipolar truncation
- a serious problem essentially all previous homonuclear dipolar recoupling
experiments suffer from. Combination of this recoupling concept with rotor

them both in the interior and on the boundary of, for example, the black hole

long-range bulk-boundary dependence among these degrees of freedom. In contrast
to other approaches we regard the vacuum fluctuations on microscopic scales as

importantly, we prove that the existence of a large energy gap between a few
low-lying excitation patterns and the majority of the other (in principle)
possible excitation patterns in a subvolume with given boundary excitation is
crucial for this area-dependence. We also remark that this is an indication
that some particular entangled space-time geometry of a somewhat non-local

corroborated by the explanation of a number of open questions in the field (see

using the Abel-Plana summation formula. This enables to derive the renormalized
quantities in a manifestly cutoff independent way and to present them in the
form of strongly convergent integrals. However, applications of the Abel-Plana
formula, in its usual form, are restricted by simple geometries when the
eigenmodes have a simple dependence on quantum numbers. The author generalized
the Abel-Plana formula which essentially enlarges its application range. Based
on this generalization, formulae have been obtained for various types of series
over the zeros of combinations of Bessel functions and for integrals involving
these functions. It has been shown that these results generalize the special
cases existing in literature. Further, the derived summation formulae have been
used to summarize series arising in the direct mode summation approach to the
Casimir effect for spherically and cylindrically symmetric boundaries, for
boundaries moving with uniform proper acceleration, and in various braneworld
scenarios. This allows to extract from the vacuum expectation values of local
physical observables the parts corresponding to the geometry without boundaries
and to present the boundary-induced parts in terms of integrals strongly
convergent for the points away from the boundaries. As a result, the
renormalization procedure for these observables is reduced to the corresponding
procedure for bulks without boundaries. The present paper reviews these
results. We also aim to collect the results on vacuum expectation values for
local physical observables such as the field square and the energy-momentum
tensor in manifolds with boundaries for various bulk and boundary geometries.

original unknown state? We give a positive answer to this question and quantify
the information obtainable by a given observer as a function of the number of
copies in the ensemble, and of the number of independent observers that, one
after the other, have independently measured the same ensemble of qubits before
him. The optimality of the protocol is proven and extensions to other states
and encodings are also studied. According to the general lore, the state after
a measurement has no information about the state before the measurement. Our
results manifestly show that this statement has to be taken with a grain of
salt, specially in situations where the quantum states encode confidential
information.

transparent a connection between matrix product factorizations of states and
operators, and complex weighted finite state automata. It is then shown how one
can proceed in the opposite direction: writing an automaton that ``generates''
an operator gives one an immediate matrix product factorization of it. Matrix
product factorizations have the advantage of reducing the cost of computing
expectation values by facilitating caching of intermediate calculations. Thus
our connection to complex weighted finite state automata yields insight into
what allows for efficient caching in matrix product algorithms. Finally, these
techniques are generalized to the case of multiple dimensions.

Hanle-type situation, with an optical irradiation under normal incidence and
resonant with the atomic transition. The dark resonance spectrum is predicted
to combine broad wings with a sharp maximum at line-center, that can be singled
out when detecting a derivative of the dark resonance spectrum. This narrow

a signature of the contribution of atoms slow enough to fly between the cell

presents a generalization of these concepts and methods to the quantum case,
based on the idea that quantum theory can be thought of as a noncommutative,
operator-valued, generalization of classical probability theory. Some novel
characterizations of quantum conditional independence are derived, and
definitions of Quantum n-Bifactor Networks, Markov Networks, Factor Graphs and
Bayesian Networks are proposed. The structure of Quantum Markov Networks is
investigated and some partial characterization results are obtained, along the
lines of the Hammersely-Clifford theorem. A Quantum Belief Propagation
algorithm is presented and is shown to converge on 1-Bifactor Networks and
Markov Networks when the underlying graph is a tree. The use of Quantum Belief
Propagation as a heuristic algorithm in cases where it is not known to converge
is discussed. Applications to decoding quantum error correcting codes and to
the simulation of many-body quantum systems are described.

  Control Landscapes</title><description>  A quantum control landscape is defined as the physical objective as a

these landscapes is important for understanding the origins of the increasing
number of laboratory successes in the optimal control of quantum processes.
This paper proposes a simple scheme to compute the characteristics of the
critical topology of the quantum ensemble control landscapes for observables,
showing that the set of disjoint critical submanifolds one-to-one corresponds
to a finite number of contingency tables that solely depend on the degeneracy
structure of the eigenvalues of the initial system density matrix and the
observable to be controlled. The landscape characteristics can be calculated as
functions of the table entries, including the dimensions and the numbers of
positive and negative eigenvalues of the Hessian quadratic form of each of the
connected components of the critical submanifolds. Typical examples are given
to illustrate the effectiveness of this method.

degree of freedom of a massive particle like an electron or as the spin 1
polarisation of a massless photon. In this lecture, I first use irreducible

Combining these two dynamics yields a coherent, unified picture of diffusive

induced by sequential injection of spins for a spin quantum dot that has a
quantum spin. The system consists of ``electrode/quantum
well(QW)/dot/QW/electrode&quot; junctions, in which the left QW has an energy level
of conduction electrons with only up-spin. We consider a situation in which
up-spin electrons are sequentially injected from the left electrode into the
dot through the QW and an exchange interaction acts between the electrons and
the localized spin. To describe the sequentially injected electrons, we propose
a simple method based on approximate solutions from the time-dependent
Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation. Using this method, it is shown that the spin
reversal occurs when the right QW has energy levels of conduction electrons
with only down-spin. In particular, the expression of the reversal time of a
localized spin is derived and the upper and lower limits of the time are
clearly expressed. This expression is expected to be useful for a rough
estimation of the minimum relaxation time of the localized spin to achieve the
reversal. We also obtain analytic expressions for the expectation value of the
localized spin and the electrical current as a function of time. In addition,
we found that a system with the non-magnetic right QW exhibits spin reversal or
non-reversal depending on the exchange interaction.

To what

lower bound on the classical channel capacity C(A&lt;--B) in terms of the capacity
C(A--&gt;B) for the case that the bipartite unitary operation consists of
controlled local unitaries on B conditioned on basis states on A. This can be
interpreted as a statement on the strength of the inevitable backaction of a
quantum system on its controller.
  If the local operations are given by the regular representation of a finite
group G we have C(A--&gt;B)=log |G| and C(A&lt;--B)=log N where N is the sum over the
degrees of all inequivalent representations. Hence the information deficit
C(A--&gt;B)-C(A&lt;--B) between the forward and the backward capacity depends on the
&quot;non-abelianness&quot; of the control group. For regular representations, the ratio
between backward and forward capacities cannot be smaller than 1/2. The
symmetric group S_n reaches this bound asymptotically. However, for the general
case (without group structure) all bounds must depend on the dimensions since
it is known that the ratio can tend to zero.

of alternating cell types, one with wide wells and the other narrow wells,
separated by equal strength barriers. If the wells were identical, it would be
a simply periodic system of $N = 2n$ half-cells. When asymmetry is introduced,
an allowed band splits at the Bragg point into two disjoint allowed bands. The
Bragg resonance turns into a transparent state located close to the band edge
of the lower(upper) band when the first(second) well is the wider. Analysis of
this system gives insight into how band splitting occurs. Further we consider
semi-periodic systems having $N= 2n+1$ half-cells. Surprisingly these have very
different transmission properties, with an envelope of maximum transmission
probability that crosses the envelope of minima at the transparent point.

  from the weak-coupling to the strong-coupling regime</title><description>  We study the transmission through different small systems as a function of
the coupling strength $v$ to the two attached leads. The leads are identical
with only one propagating mode $\xi^E_C$ in each of them. Besides the
conductance $G$, we calculate the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the scattering wave
function $\Psi^E_C$ in the interior of the system. Most interesting results are
obtained in the regime of strongly overlapping resonance states where the
crossover from staying to traveling modes takes place. The crossover is
characterized by collective effects. Here, the conductance is plateau-like
enhanced in some energy regions of finite length while corridors with zero
transmission (total reflection) appear in other energy regions. This
transmission picture depends only weakly on the spectrum of the closed system.
It is caused by the alignment of some resonance states of the system with the
propagating modes $\xi^E_C$ in the leads. The alignment of resonance states
takes place stepwise by resonance trapping, i.e. it is accompanied by the
decoupling of other resonance states from the continuum of propagating modes.
This process is quantitatively described by the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the
scattering wave function. Averaged over energy in the considered energy window,
$&lt;G&gt;$ is correlated with $1-&lt;\rho&gt;$. In the regime of strong coupling, only two
short-lived resonance states survive each aligned with one of the channel wave
functions $\xi^E_C$. They may be identified with traveling modes through the
system. The remaining $M-2$ trapped narrow resonance states are well separated
from one another.

the chaoticity parameter lambda has been introduced phenomenologically to
represent the momentum correlation function at zero relative momentum. It is
useful to study an exactly solvable problem in which the lambda parameter and
its dependence on the coherence properties of the boson system can be worked
out in great detail. We are therefore motivated to study the state of a gas of
noninteracting identical bosons at various temperatures held together in a
harmonic oscillator potential that arises either externally or from bosons' own
mean fields. We determine the degree of Bose-Einstein condensation and its
momentum correlation function as a function of the attributes of the boson
environment. The parameter lambda can then be evaluated from the momentum
correlation function. We find that the lambda(p,T) parameter is a sensitive
function of both the average pair momentum p and the temperature T, and the
occurrence of lambda=1 is not a consistent measure of the absence of a coherent
condensate fraction. In particular, for large values of p, the lambda parameter
attains the value of unity even for significantly coherent systems with large
condensate fractions. We find that if a pion system maintains a static
equilibrium within its mean field, and if it contains a root-mean-squared
radius, a pion number, and a temperature typical of those in high-energy
heavy-ion collisions, then it will contain a large fraction of the
Bose-Einstein pion condensate.

phase transitions, we argue that second-order transitions -- typically
associated with broken or restored symmetries -- should be advantageous in
comparison to first-order transitions. Guided by simple examples we construct
an alternative adiabatic algorithm for the NP-complete problem {\em Exact Cover
3}. We show numerically that its average performance (for the considered cases
up to ${\cal O}\{20\}$ qubits) is better than that of the conventional scheme.
The run-time of adiabatic algorithms is not just determined by the minimum
value of the fundamental energy gap (between the ground state and the exited
states), but also by its curvature at the critical point. The proposed
symmetry-restoring adiabatic quantum algorithm only contains contributions
linear and quadratic in the Pauli matrices and can be generalized to other
problem Hamiltonians which are decomposed of terms involving one and two
qubits. We show how the factoring problem can be cast into such a quadratic
form. These findings suggest that adiabatic quantum algorithms can solve a
large class of NP problems much faster than the Grover search routine (which
corresponds to a first-order transition and yields a quadratic enhancement
only).

power over classical computer \cite{er1,er2}. As is well-know, a moving quantum
object passing through a double-slit exhibits particle wave duality. A quantum
computer is static and lacks this duality property. The recently proposed
duality computer has exploited this particle wave duality property, and it may
offer additional computing power \cite{r1}. Simply put it, a duality computer
is a moving quantum computer passing through a double-slit. A duality computer
offers the capability to perform separate operations on the sub-waves coming
out of the different slits, in the so-called duality parallelism. Here we show
that an $n$-dubit duality computer can be modeled by an $(n+1)$-qubit quantum
computer. In a duality mode, computing operations are not necessarily unitary.
A $n$-qubit quantum computer can be used as an $n$-bit reversible classical
computer and is energy efficient. Our result further enables a $(n+1)$-qubit
quantum computer to run classical algorithms in a $O(2^n)$-bit classical
computer. The duality mode provides a natural link between classical computing
and quantum computing. Here we also propose a recycling computing mode in which
a quantum computer will continue to compute until the result is obtained. These
two modes provide new tool for algorithm design. A search algorithm for the
unsorted database search problem is designed.

  optical lattice</title><description>  Ultra-cold atoms trapped by light, with their robust quantum coherence and
controllability, provide an attractive system for quantum information
processing and for simulation of complex problems in condensed matter physics.
Many quantum information processing schemes require that individual qubits be
manipulated and deterministically entangled with one another, a process that
would typically be accomplished by controlled, state-dependent, coherent
interactions among qubits. Recent experiments have made progress toward this
goal by demonstrating entanglement among an ensemble of atoms confined in an
optical lattice. Until now, however, there has been no demonstration of a key
operation: controlled entanglement between atoms in isolated pairs. We have
used an optical lattice of double-well potentials to isolate and manipulate
arrays of paired atoms, inducing controlled entangling interactions within each
pair. Our experiment is the first realization of proposals to use controlled
exchange coupling in a system of neutral atoms. Although 87Rb atoms have nearly
state-independent interactions, when we force two atoms into the same physical
location, the wavefunction exchange symmetry of these identical bosons leads to
state-dependent dynamics. We observe repeated interchange of spin between atoms
occupying different vibrational levels, with a coherence time of more than ten
milliseconds. This observation represents the first demonstration of the
essential component of a quantum SWAP gate in neutral atoms. The &quot;half
implementation&quot; of SWAP, the sqrt(SWAP) gate, is entangling, and together with
single qubit rotations form a set of universal gates for quantum computation.

known separable state. When a state is shown to be separable, a proof of this
fact is provided in the form of an explicit convex decomposition of the state
in terms of product states. All states in the interior of the set of separable
states can be detected in this way, except maybe for a set of measure zero.
Even though this technique is more suited for a numerical approach, a new

implementing quantum gates in continuous variable systems with quadratic
Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that it is possible to define a fidelity measure
for continuous variable (CV) gate optimization that is devoid of traps, such
that the search for optimal control fields using local algorithms will not be
hindered. The optimal control of several quantum computing gates, as well as
that of algorithms composed of these primitives, is investigated using several
typical physical models and compared for discrete and continuous quantum
systems. Numerical simulations indicate that the optimization of generic CV
quantum gates is inherently more expensive than that of generic discrete
variable quantum gates, and that the exact-time controllability of CV systems
plays an important role in determining the maximum achievable gate fidelity.
The resulting optimal control fields typically display more complicated Fourier
spectra that suggest a richer variety of possible control mechanisms. Moreover,
the ability to control interactions between qunits is important for delimiting
the total control fluence. The comparative ability of current experimental
protocols to implement such time-dependent controls may help determine which
physical incarnations of CV quantum information processing will be the easiest
to implement with optimal fidelity.

the system control variables. Such landscapes were introduced to provide a
basis to understand the increasing number of successful experiments controlling
quantum dynamics phenomena. This paper extends the concept to encompass the
broader context of the environment having an influence. For the case that the
open system dynamics are fully controllable, it is shown that the control
landscape for open systems can be lifted to the analysis of an equivalent
auxiliary landscape of a closed composite system that contains the
environmental interactions. This inherent connection can be analyzed to provide
relevant information about the topology of the original open system landscape.
Application to the optimization of an observable expectation value reveals the
same landscape simplicity observed in former studies on closed systems. In
particular, no false sub-optimal traps exist in the system control landscape
when seeking to optimize an observable, even in the presence of complex
environments. Moreover, a quantitative study of the control landscape of a
system interacting with a thermal environment shows that the enhanced
controllability attainable with open dynamics significantly broadens the range
of the achievable observable values over the control landscape.

outgoing target photon modes of the gate are available and feed-forwardable.
Individual atoms are controlled by a stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
transition and photons by a ring resonator with two outgoing ports. Realistic

is mounted show that a strong atom-photon coupling can be achieved. It is also
shown how the resonator can be used for controlling superposition of atom

  state of a single atom in a quadratic potential field</title><description>  The paper first discusses theoretically the off-resonance selective
excitation method that is dependent on the atomic internal states and used to
generate approximately a standard coherent state of harmonic oscillator. The
coherent average method then is proposed to construct the state-selective
trigger pulse. A state-selective trigger pulse can keep Gaussian shape
unchanged but change in an internal-state-dependent form the center-of-mass
position and/or momentum of an atomic Gaussian wave-packet motional state. A
Gaussian wave-packet state is one of the simplest wave-packet states that can
be easily manipulated and controlled in time and space. The paper also
investigates how to manipulate in time and space an atomic Gaussian wave-packet
motional state by a generalized quadratic potential field. A general quadratic
Hamiltonian can affect not only the center-of-mass position and momentum but
also the complex linewidth of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state while keep
Gaussian shape of the motional state unchanged. It is shown that generally
quadratic terms of a quadratic Hamiltonian can control directly the complex
linewidth, while linear terms of a quadratic Hamiltonian can affect only the
center-of-mass position and momentum of a Gaussian wave-packet motional state.

  Coupling and Non-Markovian Regimes</title><description>  We examine the dynamics of bipartite entanglement between a two-level atom
and the electromagnetic field. We treat the Jaynes-Cummings model with a single
field mode and examine in detail the exact time evolution of entanglement,
including cases where the atomic state is initially mixed and the atomic
transition is detuned from resonance. We then explore the effects of other
nearby modes by calculating the exact time evolution of entanglement in more
complex systems with two, three, and five field modes. For these cases we can
obtain exact solutions which include the strong coupling regimes. Finally, we
consider the entanglement of a two-level atom with the infinite collection of
modes present in the intracavity field of a Fabre-Perot cavity. In contrast to
the usual treatment of atom-field interactions with a continuum of modes using
the Born-Markov approximation, our treatment in all cases describes the full
non-Markovian dynamics of the atomic subsystem. Only when an analytic
expression for the infinite mode case is desired do we need to make a weak
coupling assumption which at long times approximates Markovian dynamics.

expressed as a special instance of the partition function of a 2D Ising model

Resonant tunneling through single quantum dot can be observed at room

been a crucial element in the development of information sciences. The Chernoff
bound gives the minimal Bayesian error probability when discriminating two
hypotheses given a large number of observations. Recently the combined work of
Audenaert et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 160501] and Nussbaum and Szkola
  [quant-ph/0607216] has proved the quantum analog of this bound, which applies
when the hypotheses correspond to two quantum states. Based on the quantum
Chernoff bound, we define a physically meaningful distinguishability measure
and its corresponding metric in the space of states; the latter is shown to
coincide with the Wigner-Yanase metric. Along the same lines, we define a
second, more easily implementable, distinguishability measure based on the
error probability of discrimination when the same local measurement is
performed on every copy. We study some general properties of these measures,
including the probability distribution of density matrices, defined via the
volume element induced by the metric, and illustrate their use in the
paradigmatic cases of qubits and Gaussian infinite-dimensional states.

we address an exactly solvable two-particle scattering problem where the target
is an excitable scatterer. Useful entanglement, as measured by the two particle
concurrence, is obtained from post-selection of oppositely scattered particle
states. The $S$ matrix formalism is generalized in order to address non-unitary
evolution in the propagating channels. We find the striking result that
inelasticity can actually increase concurrence as compared to the elastic case
by increasing the uncertainty of the single particle subspace. Concurrence
zeros are controlled by either single particle resonance energies or total
reflection conditions that ascertain precisely one of the electron states.
Concurrence minima also occur and are controlled by entangled resonance
situations were the electron becomes entangled with the scatterer, and thus
does not give up full information of its state. In this model, exciting the
scatterer can never fully destroy phase coherence due to an intrinsic limit to
the probability of inelastic events.

draw positive work locally from the individual subsystems while $W_{AB}$ is
positive. This could be another interesting manifestation of quantum

between two real metals described by Leontovich surface impedance are obtained
in the framework of thermal quantum field theory. It is shown that the Casimir
entropy computed using the impedance of infrared optics vanishes in the limit
of zero temperature. By contrast, the Casimir entropy computed using the
impedance of the Drude model attains at zero temperature a positive value which
depends on the parameters of a system, i.e., the Nernst heat theorem is
violated. Thus, the impedance of infrared optics withstands the thermodynamic
test, whereas the impedance of the Drude model does not. We also perform a
phenomenological analysis of the thermal Casimir force and of the radiative
heat transfer through a vacuum gap between real metal plates. The
characterization of a metal by means of the Leontovich impedance of the Drude
model is shown to be inconsistent with experiment at separations of a few
hundred nanometers. A modification of the impedance of infrared optics is
suggested taking into account relaxation processes. The power of radiative heat
transfer predicted from this impedance is several times less than previous
predictions due to different contributions from the transverse electric
evanescent waves. The physical meaning of low frequencies in the Lifshitz

Improvements in position-like measurements can increase the accuracy by an

accurate measurements of the energy levels. The GRANIT experiment is devoted to
the study of resonant transitions between quantum states induced by an
oscillating perturbation.
  According to Heisenberg's uncertainty relations, the accuracy of measurement
of the energy levels is limited by the time available to perform the

that he knows an agreed (possibly low-entropy) password w, while giving away as
little information on w as possible, namely the adversary can exclude at most
one possible password for each execution of the scheme. We propose a solution
in the bounded-quantum-storage model, where U and S may exchange qubits, and a
dishonest party is assumed to have limited quantum memory. No other restriction
is posed upon the adversary.
  An improved version of the proposed identification scheme is also secure
against a man-in-the-middle attack, but requires U and S to additionally share
a high-entropy key k. However, security is still guaranteed if one party loses
k to the attacker but notices the loss. In both versions of the scheme, the
honest participants need no quantum memory, and noise and imperfect quantum
sources can be tolerated. The schemes compose sequentially, and w and k can
securely be re-used.
  A small modification to the identification scheme results in a
quantum-key-distribution (QKD) scheme, secure in the bounded-quantum-storage
model, with the same re-usability properties of the keys, and without assuming
authenticated channels. This is in sharp contrast to known QKD schemes (with
unbounded adversary) without authenticated channels, where authentication keys
must be updated, and unsuccessful executions can cause the parties to run out

As a result, the continuum components of the regularized wave function are

state and few excited states are \sim 10^{-12}eV. We show that the energy of
the ground state of a neutron confined above Earth's surface should be \sim
10^{-37}eV. The experimentally observed energy levels are 10^{25} times deeper
than the actual energy levels it should be and thus certainly not due to
gravitational effect of Earth. Therefore the correct interpretation for the
painstaking experimental results of Ref. \cite{nes1} is due to the confinement
potential of a one dimensional box of length L \sim 50\mu m, generated from the

entanglement is completely lost and both modes are finally uncorrelated. In a
common reservoir both modes interact indirectly via the coupling to the same
bath variables. Below a critical bath temperature entanglement between the two
modes is preserved even in the steady state. A separability criterion is
derived, which depends on the bath temperature and the response function of the
open quantum system. Thus, the extended quantum Brownian motion model of a
two-mode continuous variable system in a common reservoir provides an example
of environment-induced entanglement.

quantum information theory and the theory of extremal stringy black hole
solutions. We show that the three-qubit interpretation of supersymmetric black
hole solutions in the STU model can be extended also to include
non-supersymmetric ones. First we show that the black hole potential can be
expressed as one half the norm of a suitably chosen three-qubit entangled state
containing the quantized charges and the moduli. The extremization of the black
hole potential in terms of this entangled state amounts to either supressing
bit flip errors (BPS-case) or allowing very special types of flips transforming
the states between different classes of non-BPS solutions. We are illustrating
our results for the example of the D2-D6 system. In this case the bit flip
errors are corresponding to sign flip errors of the charges originating from
the number of D2 branes. After moduli stabilization the states depending
entirely on the charges are maximally entangled graph states (of the triangle
graph) well-known from quantum information theory. An N=8 interpretation of the
STU-model in terms of a mixed state with fermionic purifications is also given.

statistical mechanics. A close examination of the foundations of statistical
mechanics and the need to reconcile the probabilistic and deterministic views
of the world leads us to a discussion of chaotic dynamics, where information
plays a crucial role in quantifying predictability. We then discuss a variety
of fundamental issues that emerge in defining information and how one must
exercise care in discussing concepts such as order, disorder, and incomplete

relevance for nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
  In the final part of the paper we discuss how quantum mechanics gives rise to
the very different concept of quantum information. Entirely new possibilities
for information storage and computation are possible due to the massive
parallel processing inherent in quantum mechanics. We also point out how
entropy can be extended to apply to quantum mechanics to provide a useful
measurement for quantum entanglement.
  Finally we make a small excursion to the interface betweeen quantum theory
and general relativity, where one is confronted with an &quot;ultimate information

initialised in a product of their ground states, the resonator is initialised
in a coherent field state, and the state of the system is allowed to evolve
under a rotating wave Hamiltonian. Making a homodyne measurement on the
resonator at a given time projects the qubits into an state of the form (|gg&gt; +

the qubits induce the time evolution that can be regarded, at discrete times,
as the Rabi oscillation of a logical qubit. Neither fine tuning of the

straightforward application of quantum error correction fails, we propose a
protocol by which the logical Rabi oscillation is protected against all
single-qubit errors. The present method thus opens a simple and realistic way
of protecting the unitary time evolution against noise.

Specifically we examine whether it is better to measure each of the observables
separately on different copies or to perform a joint measurement of the

an advantage over separate measurements, but only if we make estimates of an

we instead use both sets of results to estimate each observable then we find
that individual measurements will be better. Finally we consider estimating the

These algorithms can be implemented experimentally and offer an alternative to

the effect given their causes tend to be less complex and smoother than
conditionals for causes, given their effects. We have recently proposed and
tested methods for causal inference in machine learning using a formalization
of this principle.
  Here we try to provide some theoretical justification for causal inference
methods based upon such a ``causally asymmetric'' interpretation of Occam's
Razor. To this end, we discuss toy models of cause-effect relations from
classical and quantum physics as well as computer science in the context of
various aspects of complexity.
  We argue that this asymmetry of the statistical dependences between cause and
effect has a thermodynamic origin. The essential link is the tendency of the
environment to provide independent background noise realized by physical
systems that are initially uncorrelated with the system under consideration
rather than being finally uncorrelated. This link extends ideas from the
literature relating Reichenbach's principle of the common cause to the second

using two measures: the average bipartite entanglement and the Groverian

one dimensional chain in which two-qubit gates apply only locally between
nearest neighbors and a non-local geometry in which such gates may apply
between any pair of qubits. More specifically, we use a combination of random
single qubit rotations and a fixed two-qubit gate such as the controlled-phase

at a higher rate. In both geometries, the Groverian measure converges to its
asymptotic value more slowly than the average bipartite entanglement. These
results are expected to have implications on different proposed geometries of
future quantum computers with local and non-local interactions between the

We consider a superconducting lattice with a magnetic impurity inserted at its
centre, and look at the fidelity between partial (either one-site or two-site)
quantum states. In the vicinity of the point of the quantum phase transition,
we observe a sudden drop of the fidelity between two one-site partial states
corresponding to the impurity location and its close vicinity. In the case of
two-site states, the fidelity reveals the transition point as long as one of
the two electron sites is located at the impurity, while the other lies
elsewhere in the lattice. We also determine the Uhlmann mixed state geometric
phase, recently introduced in the study of the structural change of the system
state eigenvectors in the vicinity of the lines of thermal phase transitions,
and find it to be trivial, both for one- and two-site partial states, except
when an electron site is at the impurity. This means that the system partial
state eigenvectors do not contribute significantly to the enhanced state
distinguishability around the point of this quantum phase transition. Finally,
we use the fidelity to analyze the total amount of correlations contained
within a composite system, showing that, even for the smallest two-site states,
it features an abrupt quantitative change in the vicinity of the point of the
quantum phase transition.

connect quantum theory to experimental predictions, leaving the predictions of

unitarity of the formalism in the presence of measurements allows us to invoke
time-reversal symmetry to obtain new predictions closely related to the quantum

that local projective measurements and classical communication are as powerful
as the most general local measurements and classical communication. Remarkably,
this indicates that the local distinguishability of multi-qubit states can be
decided efficiently. Another useful consequence is that a set of orthogonal
$n$-qubit states is locally distinguishable only if the summation of their
orthogonal Schmidt numbers is less than the total dimension $2^n$. When $n=2$
such a condition is also sufficient. Employing these results, we show that any
orthonormal basis of a subspace spanned by arbitrary three-qubit orthogonal
unextendible product bases (UPB) cannot be exactly distinguishable by local
operations and classical communication. This not only reveals another intrinsic
property of three-qubit orthogonal UPB, but also provides a class of locally
indistinguishable subspaces with dimension 4. We also explicitly construct
locally indistinguishable subspaces with dimensions 3 and 5, respectively. In
particular, 3 is the minimal possible dimension of locally indistinguishable
subspaces. Combining with the previous results, we conclude that any positive
integer between 3 and 7 is the possible dimension of some three-qubit locally

wave function to one of the common eigenstates of the collapsing operators, and
that the collapse occurs with the correct quantum probabilities. We also
develop a perturbation expansion of the solution of the equation with respect
to the parameter which sets the strength of the collapse process; such an

possible worlds arising in an evolving closed quantum system, in which each
possible world corresponds to a (generally mixed) evolving quantum state. In a
realistic model, the states corresponding to different worlds should be
expected to tend towards orthogonality as different possible quasiclassical
structures emerge or as measurement-like interactions produce different
classical outcomes. However, as the worlds have a precise mathematical
definition, real world interpretations need no definition of quasiclassicality,
measurement, or other concepts whose imprecision is problematic in other
interpretational approaches. It is natural to postulate that precisely one
world is chosen randomly, using the natural probability distribution, as the
world realised in Nature, and that this world's mathematical characterisation
is a complete description of reality.

by using non-Hermitian Hamilton operators of different type. Here, it is
demonstrated that the passage time is tunable in realistic open quantum systems

operator. As an example, the numerical results obtained by Bulgakov et al. for
the transmission through microwave cavities of different shape are analyzed
from the point of view of the brachistochrone problem. The passage time is
shortened in the crossover from the weak-coupling to the strong-coupling regime
where the resonance states overlap and many branch points (exceptional points)
in the complex plane exist. The effect can {\it not} be described in the
framework of standard quantum mechanics with Hermitian Hamilton operator and

framework to address the problem of which ensemble averages can be estimated by
means of an available set of measuring apparatuses, e. g. estimate the ensemble
average of an observable by measuring other observable. A main ingredient in
this approach is that of informationally complete (infocomplete in short)
measurements, which allow to estimate the ensemble average of any arbitrary
system operator, as for quantum tomography. This naturally leads to the more
stringent concept of AB-informationally complete measurements, by which one can
estimate jointly all the moments of two incompatible observables A and B. After
analyzing all general properties of such measurements, we address the problem
of their optimality, and we completely solve the case of qubits, showing that a
sigma_x sigma_y-infocomplete measurement is less noisy than any infocomplete
one. We will also discuss the relation between the concept of
AB-infocompleteness and the notion of joint measurement of observables A and B.

exhibit an asymmetry between dephasing and relaxation that may result in qubits
experiencing discrete phase errors more frequently than discrete bit errors. In
the presence of such an error asymmetry, an appropriately asymmetric quantum
code - that is, a code that can correct more phase errors than bit errors -
will be more efficient than a traditional, symmetric quantum code. Here we
construct fault tolerant circuits to convert between an asymmetric subsystem
code and a symmetric subsystem code. We show that, for a moderate error
asymmetry, the failure rate of a logical circuit can be reduced by using a
combined symmetric asymmetric system and that doing so does not preclude
universality.

then additional quantum information deposited in the black hole is revealed in
the Hawking radiation very rapidly. Information deposited prior to the half-way

These conclusions hold because typical local quantum circuits are efficient

appropriately motivated information theoretic extension, is described by a
general nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. Depending on the choice of the
enthalpy function, one obtains the cubic NLS or other modified NLS equations
that have applications in various fields. Next, by considering the integrable

measures which include the Fisher measure as their first member. The lowest
members of the hiearchy are shown to be included in the expansion of a
regularized Kullback-Leibler measure while, on the other hand, a suitable
combination of the NLS hierarchy leads to a Wootters type measure related to a

is currently attracting a lot of interest. Various methods have been developed
to produce ultracold molecules in pre-set quantum states. For future
experiments it will be important to efficiently transfer these molecules from
their initial quantum state to other quantum states of interest. Optical Raman
schemes are excellent tools for transfer, but can be involved in terms of
equipment, laser stabilization and finding the right transitions. Here we
demonstrate a very general and simple way for transfer of molecules from one
quantum state to a neighboring quantum state with better than 99% efficiency.
The scheme is based on Zeeman tuning the molecular state to avoided level
crossings where radio-frequency transitions can then be carried out. By
repeating this process at different crossings, molecules can be successively
transported through a large manifold of quantum states. As an important
spin-off of our experiments, we demonstrate a high-precision spectroscopy
method for investigating level crossings.

&quot;closed&quot; hamiltonian operator and &quot;open&quot; markovian Lindblad operators, is
obtained. The theory is based on the chord function, i.e. the Fourier transform
of the Wigner function. It reduces to an exact solution of the Lindblad master
equation if the hamiltonian operator is a quadratic function and the Lindblad
operators are linear functions of positions and momenta.
  Initially, the semiclassical formulae for the case of hermitian Lindblad
operators are reinterpreted in terms of a (real) double phase space, generated
by an appropriate classical double Hamiltonian. An extra &quot;open&quot; term is added
to the double Hamiltonian by the non-hermitian part of the Lindblad operators
in the general case of dissipative markovian evolution. The particular case of
generic hamiltonian operators, but linear dissipative Lindblad operators, is
studied in more detail. A Liouville-type equivariance still holds for the
corresponding classical evolution in double phase, but the centre subspace,
which supports the Wigner function, is compressed, along with expansion of its
conjugate subspace, which supports the chord function.
  Decoherence narrows the relevant region of double phase space to the
neighborhood of a caustic for both the Wigner function and the chord function.
This difficulty is avoided by a propagator in a mixed representation, so that a
further &quot;small-chord&quot; approximation leads to a simple generalization of the
quadratic theory for evolving Wigner functions.

an experiment to cool a nanometers-thick membrane [Thompson \textit{et al.},
arXiv:0707.1724v2, 2007]. The self-consistent cavity field modes of this system
depend strongly on the position of the middle mirror, leading to important
qualitative differences in the radiation pressure effects: in one case, the
situation is similar that of a perfectly reflecting middle mirror, with only
minor quantitative modifications. In addition, we also identify a range of
mirror positions for which the radiation-mirror coupling becomes purely
dispersive and the back-action effects that usually lead to cooling are absent,
although the mirror can still be optically trapped. The existence of these two
regimes leads us to propose a bichromatic scheme that optimizes the cooling and
trapping of partially transmissive mirrors.

This entails pumping energy into the system, which can be especially dangerous

We express the effective Hamiltonians for several pulse sequences in terms of

[quant-ph/0610027] and [quant-ph/0607216], respectively, and that are also well
suited to prove the quantum generalisation of the Hoeffding bound, which is a
modification of the Chernoff distance and specifies the optimal achievable
asymptotic error rate in the context of asymmetric hypothesis testing. This has
been done subsequently by Hayashi [quant-ph/0611013] and Nagaoka
[quant-ph/0611289] for the special case where both hypotheses have full
support.
  Moreover, quantum Stein's Lemma and quantum Sanov's theorem may be derived
directly from the quantum Hoeffding bound combining it with a result obtained
recently in [math/0703772].
  The goal of this paper is to present the proofs of the above mentioned
results in a unified way and in full generality (allowing hypothetic states
with different supports). Additionally, we give an in-depth treatment of the
properties of the quantum Chernoff distance. We argue that, although it is not
a metric, it is a natural distance measure on the set of density operators, due
to its clear operational meaning.

subsets of parties representing {\it ensembles (or collections)} of shared
multipartite CAT states, we study transformations between such {\it ensembles}
under {\it local operations and classical communication (LOCC)}. We show using
partial entropic criteria, that any two such distinct ensembles represented by
{\it $r$-uniform hypergraphs} with the same number of hyperedges (CAT states),
are LOCC incomparable for even integers $r\geq 2$, generalizing results in
\cite{mscthesis,sin:pal:kum:sri}. We show that the cardinality of the largest
set of mutually LOCC incomparable ensembles represented by $r$-uniform
hypergraphs for even $r\geq 2$, is exponential in the number of parties. We
also demonstrate LOCC incomparability between two ensembles represented by
3-uniform hypergraphs where partial entropic criteria do not help in
establishing incomparability. Further we characterize LOCC comparability of EPR
graphs in a model where LOCC is restricted to teleportation and edge
destruction. We show that this model is equivalent to one in which LOCC
transformations are carried out through a sequence of operations where each
operation adds at most one new EPR pair.

This is demonstrated both formally and with an explicit numerical example. The

introducing a new, operator theoretic form of entanglement assisted quantum
error correction, which incorporates as special cases all known error
correcting protocols, and is itself a special case of the QCC.

  wall boundary conditions in gl(1|n) solutions</title><description>  We describe a quantum system consisting of a one-dimensional linear chain of
n identical harmonic oscillators coupled by a nearest neighbor interaction. Two
boundary conditions are taken into account: periodic boundary conditions (where
the nth oscillator is coupled back to the first oscillator) and fixed wall
boundary conditions (where the first oscillator and the $n$th oscillator are
coupled to a fixed wall). The two systems are characterized by their
Hamiltonian. For their quantization, we treat these systems as Wigner Quantum
Systems (WQS), allowing more solutions than just the canonical quantization
solution. In this WQS approach, one is led to certain algebraic relations for
operators (which are linear combinations of position and momentum operators)
that should satisfy triple relations involving commutators and
anti-commutators. These triple relations have a solution in terms of the Lie
superalgebra gl(1|n). We study a particular class of gl(1|n) representations
V(p), the so-called ladder representations. For these representations, we
determine the spectrum of the Hamiltonian and of the position operators (for
both types of boundary conditions). Furthermore, we compute the eigenvectors of
the position operators in terms of stationary states. This leads to explicit
expressions for position probabilities of the n oscillators in the chain. An
analysis of the plots of such position probability distributions gives rise to
some interesting observations. In particular, the physical behavior of the
system as a WQS is very much in agreement with what one would expect from the
classical case, except that all physical quantities (energy, position and
momentum of each oscillator) have a finite spectrum.

causes almost no ionization, an addition of a Gaussian white noise to the pulse
leads to a significantly enhanced ionization probability. Tuning the noise
level, a stochastic resonance-like curve is observed showing the existence of
an optimum noise for a given laser pulse. Besides studying the sensitivity of
the obtained enhancement curve on the pulse parameters, such as the pulse

broadband chaotic light can also be used instead of the white noise to observe
similar features. The underlying enhancement mechanism is analyzed in the

unconstrained parameters and on one upper-bounded parameter, the factorization
energy. A detailed study of the model is done for the $2\times 2$ case: a
geometrical analysis of the zeros of the Jost-matrix determinant shows that the

parameters are explicitly expressed in terms of its bound-state energies, of
its resonance energy and width, or of the open-channel scattering length, which

Rev. Lett. {\bf 98}, 140402 (2007)] we defined
``steering'', a type of quantum nonlocality that is logically distinct from
both nonseparability and Bell-nonlocality. In the bipartite setting, it hinges
on the question of whether Alice can affect Bob's state at a distance through
her choice of measurement. More precisely and operationally, it hinges on the
question of whether Alice, with classical communication, can convince Bob that
they share an entangled state, under the circumstances that Bob trusts nothing
that Alice says. We argue that if she can, then this demonstrates the nonlocal
effect first identified in the famous EPR paper [Phys. Rev. {\bf 47}, 777
(1935)] as a universal effect for pure entangled states. This ability of Alice
to remotely prepare Bob's state was subsequently called steering by
Schr\&quot;odinger, whose terminology we adopt. The phenomenon of steering has been
largely overlooked, and prior to our work had not even been given a rigorous
definition that is applicable to mixed states as well as pure states. Armed
with our rigorous definition, we proved that steerable states are a strict
subset of the entangled states, and a strict superset of the states that can
exhibit Bell-nonlocality. In this work we expand on these results and provide
further examples of steerable states. We also elaborate on the connection with
the original EPR paradox.

  positive qubit maps</title><description>  A problem in quantum information theory that has received considerable
attention in recent years is the question of multiplicativity of the so-called
maximal output purity (MOP) of a quantum channel. This quantity is defined as
the maximum value of the purity one can get at the output of a channel by
varying over all physical input states, when purity is measured by the Schatten
$q$-norm, and is denoted by $\nu_q$. The multiplicativity problem is the
question whether two channels used in parallel have a combined $\nu_q$ that is
the product of the $\nu_q$ of the two channels. A positive answer would imply a
number of other additivity results in QIT.
  Very recently, P. Hayden has found counterexamples for every value of $q&gt;1$.
Nevertheless, these counterexamples require that the dimension of these
channels increases with $1-q$ and therefore do not rule out multiplicativity
for $q$ in intervals $[1,q_0)$ with $q_0$ depending on the channel dimension. I
argue that this would be enough to prove additivity of entanglement of
formation and of the classical capacity of quantum channels.
  More importantly, no counterexamples have as yet been found in the important
special case where one of the channels is a qubit-channel, i.e. its input
states are 2-dimensional. In this paper I focus attention to this qubit case
and I rephrase the multiplicativity conjecture in the language of block
matrices and prove the conjecture in a number of special cases.

surmount a high mountain in spite of the fact that they don't have the
necessary energy cannot be explained by classical physics. However, this so
called tunneling became allowed by quantum mechanics. Experimental tunneling
studies with different photonic barriers from microwave frequencies up to
ultraviolet frequencies pointed towards a universal tunneling time
(Haibel,Esposito). Experiments and calculations have shown that the tunneling
time of opaque photonic barriers (optical mirrors, e.g.) equals approximately
the reciprocal frequency of the corresponding electromagnetic wave. The
tunneling process is described by virtual photons. Virtual particles like
photons or electrons are not observable. However, from the theoretical point of
view, they represent necessary intermediate states between observable real
states. In the case of tunneling there is a virtual particle between the
incident and the transmitted particle. Tunneling modes have a purely imaginary
wave number. They represent solutions of the Schroedinger equation and of the
classical Helmholtz equation. Recent experimental and theoretical data of
electron and sound tunneling confirmed the conjecture that the tunneling
process is characterized by a universal tunneling time independent of the kind
of field. Tunneling proceeds at a time of the order of the reciprocal frequency
of the wave.

optimal. This might be important for experiment, where general Hamiltonian with
the all allowed parameters is difficult to implement, but constrained one

combined traps. It explores new features for this type of quantum effects: In a
limit of vanishing mechanical kinetic energy the AB vector potential alone
cannot induce a fractional zero-point canonical angular momentum on charged
particles at the quantum mechanical level in the AB magnetic field-free region;
But for the case of the AB vector potential with another one of a &quot;spectator&quot;

canonical angular momentum in the same limit. The &quot;spectator&quot; one does not
contribute to such a fractional zero-point quantity, but plays essential role
in guaranteeing non-trivial dynamics survived in this limit at the quantum
mechanical level. These results are significance in investigations of the AB

consider theoretically the analogous scenario for a Bose-Einstein condensate
confined within a three well system. In particular, we predict the adiabatic
transportation of an interacting Bose-Einstein condensate of 2000 Li atoms from
well one to well three without transiting the allowed intermediate region. To
an observer of this macroscopic quantum effect it would appear that, over a
timescale of the order of one second, the condensate had transported, but not
transited, a macroscopic distance of 20 microns between wells one and three.

organizes itself into regular patterns provided the size of the box in large
enough; more, above some critical time-dependent size, the density patterns are
independent of the expansion parameter. It is seen how the density at these

two distant solid-state ensembles of atoms that are coherently excited by a
short laser pulse. The ensembles are Erbium ions doped into two LiNbO3 crystals
with channel waveguides, which are placed in the two arms of a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer. The light that is spontaneously emitted after the excitation
pulse shows first-order interference. By a strong collective enhancement of the
emission, the atoms behave as ideal two-level quantum systems and no which-path

results in a high fringe visibility of 95%, which implies that the observed
spontaneous emission is highly coherent.

a simple quantum system corresponding to the superposition of three stationary
states in a 2D harmonic well with incommensurable frequencies. We study in
particular the role of nodal points in the transition to chaos. Our main
findings are: a) A proof of the existence of bounded domains in configuration
space which are devoid of nodal points, b) An analytical construction of formal
series representing regular orbits in the central domain as well as a numerical
investigation of its limits of applicability. c) A detailed exploration of the
phase-space structure near the nodal point. In this exploration we use an
adiabatic approximation and we draw the flow chart in a moving frame of
reference centered at the nodal point. We demonstrate the existence of a saddle
point (called X-point) in the vicinity of the nodal point which plays a key
role in the manifestation of exponential sensitivity of the orbits. One of the
invariant manifolds of the X-point continues as a spiral terminating at the
nodal point. We find cases of Hopf bifurcation at the nodal point and explore
the associated phase space structure of the nodal point - X-point complex. We
finally demonstrate the mechanism by which this complex generates chaos.
Numerical examples of this mechanism are given for particular chaotic orbits,

understanding of the theory of QMA-completeness is not as rich as its classical
analogue, the NP- completeness. In this paper we consider the clique problem in
graphs, which is NP- complete, and try to find its quantum analogue. We show
that, quantum clique problem can be defined as follows; Given a quantum
channel, decide whether there are k states that are distinguishable, with no
error, after passing through channel. This definition comes from reconsidering
the clique problem in terms of the zero-error capacity of graphs, and then
redefining it in quantum information theory. We prove that, quantum clique
problem is QMA-complete. In the second part of paper, we consider the same
problem for the Holevo capacity. We prove that computing the Holevo capacity as
well as the minimum entropy of a quantum channel is NP-complete. Also, we show
these results hold even if the set of quantum channels is restricted to

Here, we discuss several setups of interest where the geometry is not fixed,
such as particles in a trap or gases, by averaging over different sets of
geometries. Two averaging methods are compared. In the first method, it is
assumed that the internal electronic evolution is much faster than the change

of physical quantities determined from local variables must conform to a family
of inequalities. In this work we show that a classical model containing a local
probabilistic interaction in the measurement process can lead to a violation of
the Bell inequalities. We first introduce two-particle phase-space
distributions in classical mechanics constructed to be the analogs of quantum
mechanical angular momentum eigenstates. These distributions are then employed
in four schemes characterized by different types of detectors measuring the
angular momenta. When the model includes an interaction between the detector
and the measured particle leading to ensemble dependencies, the relevant Bell
inequalities are violated if total angular momentum is required to be
conserved. The violation is explained by identifying assumptions made in the
derivation of Bell's theorem that are not fulfilled by the model. These
assumptions will be argued to be too restrictive to see in the violation of the
Bell inequalities a faithful signature of nonlocality.

bits (qubits) in a quantum computer; single-qubit operations are now routine,
and several examples of two qubit interactions and gates having been
demonstrated. These experiments show that two nearby qubits can be readily
coupled with local interactions. Performing gates between an arbitrary pair of
distant qubits is highly desirable for any quantum computer architecture, but
has not yet been demonstrated. An efficient way to achieve this goal is to
couple the qubits to a quantum bus, which distributes quantum information among
the qubits. Here we show the implementation of such a quantum bus, using
microwave photons confined in a transmission line cavity, to couple two
superconducting qubits on opposite sides of a chip. The interaction is mediated
by the exchange of virtual rather than real photons, avoiding cavity induced
loss. Using fast control of the qubits to switch the coupling effectively on
and off, we demonstrate coherent transfer of quantum states between the qubits.
The cavity is also used to perform multiplexed control and measurement of the
qubit states. This approach can be expanded to more than two qubits, and is an
attractive architecture for quantum information processing on a chip.

coherent laser beam as input, a high-finesse optical cavity is required to
overcome sensitivity to spontaneous emission. We show, however, that with a

and best results would be obtained by combining both cavity-feedback and
twin-Fock inputs. Such an approach may allow a fidelity of $.99$ using a

-2.6 +/- 0.3 dB below the shot noise level respectively. The degree of

perturbed Floquet operator of the quantum map and its spectrum are shown to

the periodicity of the perturbed Floquet operator and exhibits an anholonomy.
Furthermore, this induces another anholonomy in the eigenspaces, i.e., the

  regime</title><description>  This article analyzes the decoherence induced on a single qubit by the
interaction with a spin chain with nontrivial internal dynamics (XY-type
interactions). The aim of the paper is to study the existence and properties of
the so-called universal regime, in which the decoherence time scale becomes
independent of the strength of the coupling with the environment. It is shown
that although such regime does exist, as previously established by Cucchietti
\textit{et al} in {\em Phys. Rev. A}, 75:032337 (2007), it is not a clear
signature of a quantum phase transition in the environment. In fact, this kind
of universality also exists in the absence of quantum phase transitions. A
universal regime can be related to the existence of an energy scale separation
between the Hamiltonian of the environment and the one characterizing the
system-environment interaction. The results presented also indicate that in the
strong coupling regime the quantum phase transition does not produce an
enhancement of decoherence (as opposed to what happens in the weak coupling
regime).

that is based on states of single, finite strings of qukits for any base k &gt; 1.
Both unary representations and the possibility that qukits with k a prime
number are elementary and the rest composite are discussed. Cauchy sequences of
qukit string states are defined from the arithmetic properties. The
representations of R and C, as equivalence classes of these sequences, differ
from classical kit string state representations in two ways: the freedom of
choice of basis states, and the fact that each quantum theory representation is
part of a mathematical structure that is itself based on the real and complex
numbers. These aspects enable the description of 3 dimensional frame fields
labeled by different k values, different basis or gauge choices, and different
iteration stages. The reference frames in the field are based on each R and C
representation where each frame contains representations of all physical
theories as mathematical structures based on the R and C representation.
Approaches to integrating this with physics are described. It is observed that
R and C values of physical quantities, matrix elements, etc. which are viewed
in a frame as elementary and featureless, are seen in a parent frame as
equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of qukit string states.

of the most promising proposals of physical realization, and opens new
perspectives for parallelization by taking advantage of quantum entanglement.
Since a one-way quantum computation is based on quantum measurement, which is a
fundamentally nondeterministic evolution, a sufficient condition of global
determinism has been introduced as the existence of a causal flow in a graph
that underlies the computation. A O(n^3)-algorithm has been introduced for
finding such a causal flow when the numbers of output and input vertices in the
graph are equal, otherwise no polynomial time algorithm was known for deciding
whether a graph has a causal flow or not. Our main contribution is to introduce
a O(n^2)-algorithm for finding a causal flow, if any, whatever the numbers of
input and output vertices are. This answers the open question stated by Danos
and Kashefi and by de Beaudrap. Moreover, we prove that our algorithm produces
an optimal flow (flow of minimal depth.)
  Whereas the existence of a causal flow is a sufficient condition for
determinism, it is not a necessary condition. A weaker version of the causal
flow, called gflow (generalized flow) has been introduced and has been proved
to be a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of deterministic
computations. Moreover the depth of the quantum computation is upper bounded by
the depth of the gflow. However, the existence of a polynomial time algorithm
that finds a gflow has been stated as an open question. In this paper we answer
this positively with a polynomial time algorithm that outputs an optimal gflow
of a given graph and thus finds an optimal correction strategy to the
nondeterministic evolution due to measurements.

  by local system-environment interactions</title><description>  This article studies the decoherence induced on a system of two qubits by
local interactions with a spin chain with nontrivial internal dynamics
(governed by an XY Hamiltonian). Special attention is payed to the transition
between two limits: one in which both qubits interact with the same site of the
chain and another one where they interact with distant sites. The two cases
exhibit different behaviours in the weak and strong coupling regimes: when the
coupling is weak it is found that decoherence tends to decrease with distance,
while for strong coupling the result is the opposite. Also, in the weak
coupling case, the long distance limit is rapidly reached, while for strong
coupling there is clear evidence of an expected effect: environment-induced
interactions between the qubits of the system. A consequence of this is the
appearance of quasiperiodic events that can be interpreted as ``sudden deaths''
and ``sudden revivals'' of the entanglement between the qubits, with a time
scale related to the distance between them.

surface code models that display low d-dimensional Gauge-Like Symmetries, such

symmetry operators vanishes at any non-zero temperature, a phenomenon that we
coined thermal fragility. The autocorrelation time for the non-local
topological quantities in these systems may remain finite even in the
thermodynamic limit. We provide explicit expressions for the autocorrelation
functions in Kitaev's model. If temperatures far below the gap may be achieved
then these autocorrelation times, albeit finite, can be made large. The
physical engine behind the loss of correlations at large spatial and/or

we point out that the instance of self-trapping of the condensate, without
external trap potential, is physically best understood by introducing
appropriate &quot;atomic&quot; units. This reveals a remarkable scaling property: the
physics of the condensate depends only on the two parameters $N^2 a/a_u$ and
$\gamma/N^2$, where $N$ is the particle number, $a$ the scattering length,
$a_u$ the &quot;Bohr&quot; radius and $\gamma$ the trap frequency in atomic units. We
calculate accurate numerical results for self-trapping wave functions and
potentials, for energies, sizes and peak densities, and compare with previous
variational results. As a novel feature we point out the existence of a second
solution of the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation for negative scattering
lengths, with and without trapping potential, which is born together with the
ground state in a tangent bifurcation. This indicates the existence of an
unstable collectively excited state of the condensate for negative scattering

- are widely conjectured to be different: there exists quantum discrete
memoryless channel for which $Q_2&gt;Q_B$. We then present a general scheme to

newly-defined quantity of the quantum depolarizing channel, and illustrate with
Cat (repetition) code and Shor code. We contrast the present notion with
entanglement purification protocols by showing that whilst the Leung-Shor

aforementioned Cat code. For the quantum depolarizing channel, we prove a

observables are the proton spectra associated to the H^+ + H^+ fragmentation
channel. The model is based on the time-dependent Schr\&quot;odinger equation and
treats on the same level the electronic and nuclear coordinates. Therefore it
allows to follow the ultrafast nuclear dynamics as a function of the laser
pulse duration, carrier-envelope phase offset and peak intensity. We mainly
report results in the sequential double ionization regime above 2 10^{14}
W/cm^2. The proton spectra are shifted to higher energies as the pulse duration
is reduced from 40fs down to 10fs. The good agreement between the model
predictions and the experimental data at 10fs permits a theoretical study with
pulse durations down to a few femtoseconds. We demonstrate the very fast

the two ionization events giving respectively H2^+ from H2 and H^+ + H^+ from

measurement of optical phase, used in length metrology and many other
applications. Advances in precision measurement have consistently led to
important scientific discoveries. At the fundamental level, measurement
precision is limited by the number N of quantum resources (such as photons)
that are used. Standard measurement schemes, using each resource independently,
lead to a phase uncertainty that scales as 1/sqrt(N) - known as the standard
quantum limit. However, it has long been conjectured that it should be possible
to achieve a precision limited only by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle,
dramatically improving the scaling to 1/N. It is commonly thought that
achieving this improvement requires the use of exotic quantum entangled states,
such as the NOON state. These states are extremely difficult to generate.
Measurement schemes with counted photons or ions have been performed with N &lt;=
6, but few have surpassed the standard quantum limit and none have shown
Heisenberg-limited scaling. Here we demonstrate experimentally a
Heisenberg-limited phase estimation procedure. We replace entangled input
states with multiple applications of the phase shift on unentangled
single-photon states. We generalize Kitaev's phase estimation algorithm using
adaptive measurement theory to achieve a standard deviation scaling at the
Heisenberg limit. For the largest number of resources used (N = 378), we
estimate an unknown phase with a variance more than 10 dB below the standard
quantum limit; achieving this variance would require more than 4,000 resources
using standard interferometry. Our results represent a drastic reduction in the
complexity of achieving quantum-enhanced measurement precision.

optical power of the coherent pulses by applying different levels of
well-calibrated attenuation. The linearity at high repetition rates is limited
by the APD dead time and a non-linear response arises at higher photon-numbers
due to multiphoton events. Assuming Poissonian input light statistics we
ascertain the effective mean photon-number of the incident light with high
accuracy. Time multiplexed detectors (TMD) allow to accomplish photon- number
resolution by photon chopping. This detection setup extends the linear response
function to higher photon-numbers and statistical methods may be used to
compensate for non-linearity. We investigated this effect, compare it to the
single APD case and show the validity of the convolution treatment in the TMD
data analysis.

Schulman gives an explicit physical mechanism for this connection, based on the

It will be shown that any computational process that can take place in an

of merit between LOCC optimal protocol and globally optimal protocol in doing
certain task, e.g., state estimation, state discrimination, cloning and
broadcasting. Especially, we focus on the case where $n$ tensor of unknown

  Our conclusion is that separable pure states are more non-local than
entangled pure states. More specifically, the difference in the figure of the
merit is exponentially small if the state is entangled, and the exponent is log
of the largest Schmidt coefficient. On the other hand, in many cases,
estimation of separable states by LOCC is worse than the global optimal
estimate by $O(\frac{1}{n})$.
  To show that the gap is exponentially small for entangled states, we propose
self-teleportation protocol as the key component of construct of LOCC
protocols. Objective of the protocol is to transfer Alice's part of quantum

few-photon interference effects. In these proposals, the photons are treated as
being indistinguishable particles. However, single photon sources are typically
subject to variation from device to device. Thus the photons emitted from
different sources will not be perfectly identical, and there will be some
variation in their frequencies. Here, we analyse the effect of this frequency
mismatch on QIP schemes. As examples, we consider the distributed QIP protocol
proposed by Barrett and Kok, and Hong-Ou-Mandel interference which lies at the
heart of many linear optical schemes for quantum computing. In the distributed
QIP protocol, we find that the fidelity of entangled qubit states depends
crucially on the time resolution of single photon detectors. In particular,
there is no reduction in the fidelity when an ideal detector model is assumed,
while reduced fidelities may be encountered when using realistic detectors with
a finite response time. We obtain similar results in the case of Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference -- with perfect detectors, a modified version of quantum
interference is seen, and the visibility of the interference pattern is reduced
as the detector time resolution is reduced. Our findings indicate that problems
due to frequency mismatch can be overcome, provided sufficiently fast detectors
are available.

intelligent states (GIS) do so in the more generalized uncertainty relation,
the Schrodinger-Robertson inequality. In general, OISs form a subset of GISs.
However, if there exists a unitary evolution U that transforms the operators
{A, B} to a new pair of operators in a rotation form, it is shown that an
arbitrary GIS can be generated by applying the rotation operator U to a certain
OIS. In this sense, the set of OISs is unitarily equivalent to the set of GISs.
It is the case, for example, with the su(2) and the su(1,1) algebra that have

U corresponds to phase shift, beam splitting, or parametric amplification,

Molecular and High Performance Modeling and Simulation for Devices and Systems
(QMHP) in its core program. The main purpose of this thrust area is to capture
scientific opportunities that result from new fundamental cross-cutting
research involving three core research communities: (1) experts in modeling and
simulation of electronic devices and systems; (2) high performance computing
relevant to devices and systems; and (3) the quantum many-body principles
relevant to devices and systems. ECCS is especially interested in learning how
work in these areas could enable whole new classes of systems or devices,
beyond what is already under development in existing mainstream research. The
workshop helped identify technical areas that will enable fundamental
breakthroughs in the future. Modeling and simulation in the electronics and
optoelectronics areas, in general, have already resulted in important
fundamental scientific understanding and advances in design and development of
devices and systems. With the increasing emphasis on the next generation of
devices and systems at the nano, micro, and macro scales and the
interdisciplinary nature of the research, it is imperative that we explore new
mathematical models and simulation techniques. This workshop report provides a
better understanding of unmet emerging new opportunities to improve modeling,
simulation and design techniques for hybrid devices and systems. The purpose
the QMHP workshop was to define the field and strengthen the focus of the
thrust. The ultimate goal of the workshop was to produce a final report (this

frequency multiplexing scheme can achieve better stability in practice than the
time-multiplexing scheme, because it allows one to use matched fiber lengths
for the signal and the LO paths on both sides of the double MZI, greatly
reducing the phase instability caused by unmatched fiber lengths. Our
experimental noise analysis quantifies the three main contributions to the
excess noise, which will be instructive to future studies of the GMCS QKD
systems. Finally, we demonstrate, under the &quot;realistic model&quot; in which Eve
cannot control the system within Bob's terminal, a secure key rate of
0.3bit/pulse over a 5km fiber link. This key rate is about two orders of
magnitude higher than that of a practical BB84 QKD system.

  initialization errors</title><description>  In the theory of operator quantum error correction (OQEC), the notion of
correctability is defined under the assumption that states are perfectly
initialized inside a particular subspace, a factor of which (a subsystem)
contains the protected information. If the initial state of the system does not
belong entirely to the subspace in question, the restriction of the state to
the otherwise correctable subsystem may not remain invariant after the
application of noise and error correction. It is known that in the case of
decoherence-free subspaces and subsystems (DFSs) the condition for perfect
unitary evolution inside the code imposes more restrictive conditions on the
noise process if one allows imperfect initialization. It was believed that
these conditions are necessary if DFSs are to be able to protect imperfectly
encoded states from subsequent errors. By a similar argument, general OQEC
codes would also require more restrictive error-correction conditions for the
case of imperfect initialization. In this study, we examine this requirement by
looking at the errors on the encoded state. In order to quantitatively analyze
the errors in an OQEC code, we introduce a measure of the fidelity between the
encoded information in two states for the case of subsystem encoding. A major
part of the paper concerns the definition of the measure and the derivation of
its properties. In contrast to what was previously believed, we obtain that
more restrictive conditions are not necessary neither for DFSs nor for general
OQEC codes. This is because the effective noise that can arise inside the code
as a result of imperfect initialization is such that it can only increase the
fidelity of an imperfectly encoded state with a perfectly encoded one.

space-time--as predicted by the dynamical Casimir effect--is studied for the
case of a semitransparent mirror initially at rest, then accelerating for some
finite time, along a specified trajectory, and finally moving with constant
velocity. When the reflection and transmission coefficients are those in the
model proposed by Barton, Calogeracos, and Nicolaevici
[$r(w)=-i\alpha/(\w+i\alpha)$ and $s(w)=\w/(\w+i\alpha)$, with $\alpha\geq 0$],
the Bogoliubov coefficients on the back side of the mirror can be computed
exactly. This allows us to prove that, when $\alpha$ is very large (case of an
ideal, perfectly reflecting mirror) a thermal emission of scalar massless
particles obeying Bose-Einstein statistics is radiated from the mirror (a black
body radiation), in accordance with previous results in the literature.
However, when $\alpha$ is finite (semitransparent mirror, a physically
realistic situation) the striking result is obtained that the thermal emission
of scalar massless particles obeys Fermi-Dirac statistics. Possible
consequences of this result are envisaged.

compare pure- and pseudo-spin dynamics using as an example a system of two
quantum dots, a pair of localized conduction-band electrons in an n-doped GaAs
semiconductor. Pure-spin dynamics is obtained by tracing out the orbital
degrees of freedom, whereas pseudo-spin dynamics retains (as is conventional)
an implicit coordinate dependence. We show that magnetic field inhomogeneity
and spin-orbit interaction result in a non-unitary evolution in pure-spin
dynamics, whereas these interactions contribute to the effective pseudo-spin
Hamiltonian via terms that are asymmetric in spin permutations, in particular,
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) spin-orbit interaction. We numerically
investigate the non-unitary effects in the dynamics of the triplet states
population, purity, and Lamb energy shift, as a function of interdot distance
and magnetic field difference. The spin-orbit interaction is found to produce
effects of roughly four orders of magnitude smaller than those due to magnetic
field difference in the pure-spin model. We estimate the spin-orbit interaction
magnitude in the DM-interaction term. Our estimate gives a smaller value than
that recently obtained by Kavokin [Phys. Rev. B 64, 075305 (2001)], who did not
include double occupancy effects. We show that a necessary and sufficient
condition for obtaining a universal set of quantum logic gates, involving only
two spins, in both pure- and pseudo-spin models is that the magnetic field
inhomogeneity and the Heisenberg interaction are both non-vanishing. We also
briefly analyze pure-spin dynamics in the electron on liquid helium system
recently proposed by Lyon [Phys. Rev. A 74, 052338 (2006)].

We determine the complete Schr\&quot;odinger time evolution of the subsystem of

corresponding microcanonical temperature. Moreover, the time evolution of the

quantum information processing. There are, however, difficulties associated
with the laser cooling of one of the radial motions of ions in these traps,
namely the magnetron motion. The application of a small radio-frequency
quadrupolar electric potential resonant with the sum of the two radial motional
frequencies has been shown to couple these motions and to lead to more
efficient laser cooling. We present an analytical model that enables us to
determine laser cooling rates in the presence of such an 'axializing' field. It
is found that this field leads to an averaging of the laser cooling rates for
the two motions and hence improves the overall laser cooling efficiency. The
model also predicts shifts in the motional frequencies due to the axializing
field that are in qualitative agreement with those measured in recent
experiments. It is possible to determine laser cooling rates experimentally by
studying the phase response of the cooled ions to a near resonant excitation
field. Using the model developed in this paper, we study the expected phase
response when an axializing field is present.

not of the correlations that are present in the input state. This is shown by
establishing an appealing relation between the set of copy-correlated

system in or close to its quantum ground state. Remarkable progress in ground
state cooling has been achieved for trapped ions and atoms confined in optical
lattices. Imperative to this progress has been the technique of resolved
sideband cooling, which allows overcoming the inherent temperature limit of
Doppler cooling and necessitates a harmonic trapping frequency which exceeds
the atomic species' transition rate. The recent advent of cavity back-action
cooling of mechanical oscillators by radiation pressure has followed a similar
path with Doppler-type cooling being demonstrated, but lacking inherently the
ability to attain ground state cooling as recently predicted. Here we
demonstrate for the first time resolved sideband cooling of a mechanical
oscillator. By pumping the first lower sideband of an optical microcavity,
whose decay rate is more than twenty times smaller than the eigen-frequency of
the associated mechanical oscillator, cooling rates above 1.5 MHz are attained.
Direct spectroscopy of the motional sidebands reveals 40-fold suppression of
motional increasing processes, which could enable reaching phonon occupancies

  Population Oscillation</title><description>  In recent experiments[e.g., Nature Physics 2, 332 (2006)], the enhanced light
deflection in an atomic ensemble due to inhomogeneous fields is demonstrated by
the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) based mechanism. In this
paper, we explore an different mechanism for the similar phenomenon of the
enhanced light deflection. This mechanism is based on the coherent population
oscillation, which leads to the hole burning in the absorption spectrum. The
medium causing the deflection of probe light is an ensemble of two-level atoms
manipulated by a strong controlled field on the two photon resonances. In the
large detuning condition, the response of the medium to the pump field and
signal field is obtained with steady state approximation. And it is found that
after the probe field travels across the medium, the signal ray bends due to
the spatial-dependent profile of the control beam.

interacting via a unitary transformation and coupled to two separate baths at
different temperatures $T_h &gt; T_c$. The purpose of the engine is to extract
work due to the temperature difference. Its dynamics is not restricted to the
near equilibrium regime. The engine structure is determined by maximizing the
extracted work under various constraints. When this maximization is carried out
at finite power, the engine dynamics is described by well-defined temperatures
and satisfies the local version of the second law. In addition, its efficiency
is bounded from below by the Curzon-Ahlborn value $1-\sqrt{T_c/T_h}$ and from
above by the Carnot value $1-(T_c/T_h)$. The latter is reached|at finite
power|for a macroscopic engine, while the former is achieved in the equilibrium
limit $T_h\to T_c$. When the work is maximized at a zero power, even a small
(few-level) engine extracts work right at the Carnot efficiency.

metals consist of mobile quantum charges in thermal equilibrium with the photon
field at positive temperature $T$. Fluctuations of all degrees of freedom,

This supports the fact that, in the framework of Lifshitz' theory of

this regime. Moreover the microscopic origin of universality is seen to rely on
perfect screening sum rules that hold in great generality for conducting media.

teaches us something about the quantum mechanical universe, regardless of the
validity of such realistic assumptions. It has also recently been appreciated
that these kinds of studies are fruitful for questions relating to quantum
information and computation. Motivated by this, we extend the ontological model
formalism for realistic theories to describe a set of theories emphasizing the
role of measurement and preparation devices by introducing `hidden variables'
to describe them. We illustrate both the ontological model formalism and our
generalization of it through a series of example models taken from the
literature. Our extension of the formalism allows us to quantitatively analyze
the meaning contextuality (a constraint on successful realistic theories),
finding that - taken at face-value - it can be realized as a natural
interaction between the configurations of a system and measurement device.
However, we also describe a property that we call deficiency, which follows
from contextuality, but does not admit such a natural interpretation. Loosely
speaking, deficiency breaks a symmetry between preparations and measurements in
quantum mechanics. It is the property that the set of ontic states which a
system prepared in quantum state psi may actually be in, is strictly smaller
than the set of ontic states which would reveal the measurement outcome psi
with certainty.

theory, so as to construct new foundations for quantum logic and quantum

is accessible only through classical physics, we show how a C*-algebra of
observables A induces a topos T(A) in which the amalgamation of all of its
commutative subalgebras comprises a single commutative C*-algebra. According to
the constructive Gelfand duality theorem of Banaschewski and Mulvey, the latter
has an internal spectrum S(A) in T(A), which in our approach plays the role of
a quantum phase space of the system. Thus we associate a locale (which is the
topos-theoretical notion of a space and which intrinsically carries the
intuitionistic logical structure of a Heyting algebra) to a C*-algebra (which
is the noncommutative notion of a space). In this setting, states on A become
probability measures (more precisely, valuations) on S(A), and self-adjoint
elements of A define continuous functions (more precisely, locale maps) from
S(A) to Scott's interval domain. Noting that open subsets of S(A) correspond to
propositions about the system, the pairing map that assigns a (generalized)
truth value to a state and a proposition assumes an extremely simple
categorical form. Formulated in this way, the quantum theory defined by A is
essentially turned into a classical theory, internal to the topos T(A).

protocols can be exponentially more efficient than classical protocols on
_total_ Boolean functions in the two-party interactive model. The answer
appears to be ``No''. In 2002, Razborov proved this conjecture for so far the
most general class of functions
  F(x, y) = f(x_1 * y_1, x_2 * y_2, ..., x_n * y_n), where f is a_symmetric_
Boolean function on n Boolean inputs, and x_i, y_i are the i'th bit of x and y,
respectively. His elegant proof critically depends on the symmetry of f.
  We develop a lower-bound method that does not require symmetry and prove the
conjecture for a broader class of functions. Each of those functions F(x, y) is
obtained by what we call the ``block-composition'' of a ``building block'' g :
{0, 1}^k by {0, 1}^k --&gt; {0, 1}, with an f : {0, 1}^n --&gt;{0, 1}, such that
  F(x, y) = f(g(x_1, y_1), g(x_2, y_2), ..., g(x_n, y_n)), where x_i and y_i
are the i'th k-bit block of x and y, respectively.
  We show that as long as g itself is ``hard'' enough, its block-composition
with an_arbitrary_ f has polynomially related quantum and classical
communication complexities. Our approach gives an alternative proof for
Razborov's result (albeit with a slightly weaker parameter), and establishes
new quantum lower bounds. For example, when g is the Inner Product function for

study the quantum evolution of dark soliton initial conditions in the context
of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. An extensive set of quantum measures is
utilized in our analysis, including von Neumann and generalized quantum
entropies, quantum depletion, and the pair correlation function. We find that
quantum effects cause the soliton to fill in. Moreover, soliton-soliton
collisions become inelastic, in strong contrast to the predictions of

manipulating its states, following an inverse process of state population
inversion, and then the qubit is switched on to resonantly interact with the
neighboring quantum system. By repeating these steps, the two subsystems can be
simultaneously cooled. Our results show that this cooling is robust and

  and three-path interferometers</title><description>  For two-path interferometers, the which-path predictability $\mathcal{P}$ and
the fringe visibility $\mathcal{V}$ are familiar quantities that are much used
to talk about wave-particle duality in a quantitative way. We discuss several
candidates that suggest themselves as generalizations $P$ of $ mathcal{P}$ for
multi-path interferometers, and treat the case of three paths in considerable
detail. To each choice for the \emph{path knowledge} $P$, the
\emph{interference strength} $V$ -- the corresponding generalization of
$\mathcal{V}$ -- is found by a natural, operational procedure. In experimental
terms it amounts to finding those equal-weight superpositions of the path
amplitudes which maximize $P$ for the emerging intensities. Mathematically
speaking, one needs to identify a certain optimal one among the Fourier
transforms of the state of the interfering quantum object. Wave-particle
duality is manifest, inasmuch as P=1 implies V=0 and V=1 implies P=0, whatever
definition is chosen. The possible values of the pair $(P,V)$ are restricted to
an area with corners at $(P,V)=(0,0)$, $(P,V)=(1,0)$, and $(P,V)=(0,1)$, with
the shape of the border line from $(1,0)$ to $(0,1)$ depending on the

  tunneling</title><description>  State of the art nanomechanical resonators present quality factors Q ~ 10^3 -
10^5, which are much lower than those that can be naively extrapolated from the
behavior of micromechanical resonators. We analyze the dissipation mechanism
that arises in nanomechanical beam-structures due to the tunneling of
mesoscopic phonons between the beam and its supports (known as clamping
losses). We derive the environmental force spectral density that determines the
quantum Brownian motion of a given resonance. Our treatment is valid for low
frequencies and provides the leading contribution in the aspect ratio. This
yields fundamental limits for the Q-values which are described by simple
scaling laws and are relevant for state of the art experimental structures. In
this context, for resonant frequencies in the 0.1-1GHz range, while this
dissipation mechanism can limit flexural resonators it is found to be
negligible for torsional ones. In the case of structureless 3D supports the
corresponding environmental spectral densities are Ohmic for flexural
resonators and super-Ohmic for torsional ones, while for 2D slab supports they
yield 1/f noise. Furthermore analogous results are established for the case of
suspended semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes. Finally, we provide a
general expression for the spectral density that allows to extend our treatment
to other geometries and illustrate its use by applying it to a microtoroid. Our
analysis is relevant for applications in high precision measurements and for
the prospects of probing quantum effects in a macroscopic mechanical degree of
freedom.

hydrothermal mound scenario of Russell et al, by appealing to its wider canvas
for hypothesizing self-assembly of gregite clusters via interplay of forces
within the gel phase of FeS membranes: directed heat transport a la
Rayleigh-Benard convection for dissociation, vs oriented attachment (small
clusters) and magnetic forces (large clusters) for association, the latter
assisted by magnetic mound constituents. The directed movement of tiny clusters
through cluster layers are reminiscent of processes like budding, molecular
motors, pre-RNA world on the lines of Cairns-Smith's hypothesis, and optical
polarity. Higher rate of (soft) multinucleate formation vs growth rate of
(rigid) microcrystals, correlates with icosahedral (forbidden
crystallographically!) framboidal morphology. This pattern indicates a link to
phylotaxis, thus reinforcing the quasi-periodicity connection which can provide
a natural access to features like surface limit, anomalous transport and low
thermal conductivity, while facilitating diffusion through clusters. And
magnetism offers a hierarchy of features: primordial multicellularity; phase
correlations of assembled molecules; overcoming thermal decoherence. These
dynamical nested structures offer possibilities for iterative computations,
adaptive learning, and coherent quantum searches. The link between enzymatic
FeS clusters and the Hadean ocean floor is seen as part of a larger conceptual
framework uncovering a role for Magnetism and the Origin of Life.

reduced to that in CV quantum teleportation. The fidelity of quantum
teleportation of an optical setup is limited by the finite degree of quantum
correlation which can be prepared with a pair of finitely squeezed states.
Reports of improvement of squeezing level have appeared recently, and we
adopted the improved methods in our experimental system of quantum
teleportation. As a result, we teleported a coherent state with a fidelity
$F=0.83\pm 0.01$, which is better than any other figures reported to date. In
this paper, we introduce a measure $n_{s}$, the number of teleportations
expected to be carried out sequentially. Our result corresponds to
$n_{s}$=5.0$\pm$0.4. It suggests that our improvement would enable us to

generalized quantum metrology protocols that involve estimating an unknown

theoretical lower bound on the uncertainty in the estimate of the parameter.
For arbitrary initial states, the lower bound scales as 1/n^k, and for initial
product states, it scales as 1/n^(k-1/2). We show that the latter scaling can
be achieved using simple, separable measurements. We analyze in detail the case
of a quadratic Hamiltonian (k = 2), implementable with Bose-Einstein
condensates. We formulate a simple model, based on the evolution of
angular-momentum coherent states, which explains the O(n^(-3/2)) scaling for k

that phase decoherence does not affect the O(n^(-3/2)) sensitivity scaling for

a model is an accurate representation of the real world from the perspective of
its intended uses. Validation is crucial as industries and governments depend
increasingly on predictions by computer models to justify their decisions. In
this article, we survey the model validation literature and propose to
formulate validation as an iterative construction process that mimics the
process occurring implicitly in the minds of scientists. We thus offer a formal
representation of the progressive build-up of trust in the model, and thereby
replace incapacitating claims on the impossibility of validating a given model
by an adaptive process of constructive approximation. This approach is better
adapted to the fuzzy, coarse-grained nature of validation. Our procedure
factors in the degree of redundancy versus novelty of the experiments used for
validation as well as the degree to which the model predicts the observations.
We illustrate the new methodology first with the maturation of Quantum
Mechanics as the arguably best established physics theory and then with several
concrete examples drawn from some of our primary scientific interests: a
cellular automaton model for earthquakes, an anomalous diffusion model for
solar radiation transport in the cloudy atmosphere, and a computational fluid
dynamics code for the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. This article is an

two-level open quantum systems, whose evolution is described by general
completely positive trace preserving maps (i.e., Kraus maps), are investigated
in details. The objective function, which is the expectation value of a target
system operator, is defined on the Stiefel manifold representing the space of
Kraus maps. Three practically important properties of the objective function
are found: (a) the absence of local maxima or minima (i.e., false traps); (b)
the existence of multi-dimensional sub-manifolds of optimal solutions
corresponding to the global maximum and minimum; and (c) the connectivity of
each level set. All of the critical values and their associated critical
sub-manifolds are explicitly found for any initial system state. Away from the
absolute extrema there are no local maxima or minima, and only saddles may
exist, whose number and the explicit structure of the corresponding critical
sub-manifolds are determined by the initial system state. There are no saddles
for pure initial states, one saddle for a completely mixed initial state, and
two saddles for other initial states. In general, the landscape analysis of
critical points and optimal manifolds is relevant to the problem of explaining
the relative ease of obtaining good optimal control outcomes in the laboratory,

operations, as differences between quantum operations can become magnified when
their inputs are entangled with auxiliary systems. Bounds on the dimension of
the auxiliary system needed to optimally distinguish quantum operations are
known in several situations. For instance, the dimension of the auxiliary space
never needs to exceed the dimension of the input space of the operations for
optimal distinguishability, while no auxiliary system whatsoever is needed to
optimally distinguish unitary operations. Another bound, which follows from
work of R. Timoney, is that optimal distinguishability is always possible when
the dimension of the auxiliary system is twice the number of operators needed
to express the difference between the quantum operations in Kraus form. This
paper provides an alternate proof of this fact that is based on concepts and
tools that are familiar to quantum information theorists.

GRWm and GRWf. We call it the GRW formalism. Its structure is similar to that
of the quantum formalism but involves different operators. In other words, we
establish the validity of a general algorithm for directly computing the

the symplectic module of the generalized Pauli group of the qudit and the fine

  quantum gravitationally decohered quantum mechanics</title><description>  We restate Kay's 1998 hypothesis which simultaneously offers an objective
definition for the entropy of a closed system, a microscopic foundation for the
Second Law, a resolution of the Information Loss (and other) Black-Hole
Puzzle(s) and an objective mechanism for decoherence. Presupposing a
conventional unitary theory of low-energy quantum gravity, it offers all this
by taking the physical density operator of a closed system to be the partial
trace of its total density operator (assumed pure) over gravity and by defining
its physical entropy to be its `matter-gravity entanglement entropy'. We also
recall Kay's 1998 modified non-relativistic (many-body) quantum mechanics based
on Kay's hypothesis with a Newtonian approximation to quantum gravity. In this
modification, we find formal expectation values for certain `observables' such
as momentum-squared and Parity are altered but those for functions of positions
are unaltered. However, by arguing that every real measurement can ultimately
be taken to be a position measurement, we prove that, in practice, it is
impossible to detect any alteration at all and, in particular, we predict no
alteration for Roger Penrose's experiment. Nevertheless, Kay's modification
contains no Schr\&quot;odinger Cat-like states, and also allows an `events'
interpretation which we tentatively propose and begin to explore. We also
obtain a Second-Law type result for a non-relativistic toy-model closed system
and argue that similar results will apply for a wide class of model Newtonian
and post-Newtonian closed systems although we argue that ordinary actual
lab-sized systems can never be treated as closed for the purpose of calculating
their entropy. Compared with `collapse models' such as GRW, Kay's Newtonian
theory does a similar job while being free from ad hoc assumptions.

on improving fidelity of quantum operations. In particular, the $\pi$ pulse and
$\pi/2$ pulse quantum operations are considered. The dressed states for the
atom-field system, with an atom driven on one transition by a classical field

detunings is given for which high fidelity of desired states is achieved.
Analytical solutions for the quantum state amplitudes are found in the first
order perturbation theory with respect to the cavity damping rate $\kappa$ and
the spontaneous emission rate $\gamma$. Numerical solutions for higher values
of $\kappa$ and $\gamma$ indicate a stabilizing role of spontaneous emission in
the $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ pulse quantum operations. The idea can also be applied
for excitation pulses of different shapes.

coupled to a tight-binding lattice finding an exact analytical solution that
describes the nonexponential decay. When the first coupling is smaller than the
others, he shows that P(t) has a natural decomposition into two terms; one is
the exponential decay, consistent with the Gamow's approach, and the other is
the correction to this decay. The first purpose of this Comment is to show that
the condition imposed on the system; the site energy of the first site is set
in the center of the band, limits the generality of the results. A
decomposition based on the spectral properties of the system removes this
restriction [2]. Other point of this Comment is that, for the weak coupling
limit, the author stated that a Zeno effect occurs for t less than t*, where t*
is the smallest root of the equation g_eff(t*)=g_0, and for the strong coupling
limit an anti-Zeno effect occurs for t close to t**, where t** is the first
peak of g_eff. By using a spectral formulation we show that, the anti-Zeno
effect not only requires a strong coupling limit, also is necessary to choose
the resonance energy and width such that a destructive interference can occur.
We present this interference and give an analytical expression and physically
interpretation for t* and t**.

resonant enhancement of the current (Europhys. Lett. 79 (2007) 10007 and Phys.

shifting its location with increasing interaction strength. We trace the
Floquet states of the linear equations into the nonlinear domain, and show that
the resonance gives rise to an instability and thus to the appearance of new
nonlinear Floquet states, whose transport properties differ strongly as
compared to the case of noninteracting particles.

effectively against highly biased noise, where dephasing is far stronger than
all other types of noise. In our scheme, the fundamental operations performed
by the quantum computer are single-qubit preparations, single-qubit
measurements, and conditional-phase (CPHASE) gates, where the noise in the
CPHASE gates is biased. We show that the accuracy threshold for quantum

dephasing dominates all other types of noise in the CPHASE gates by four orders
of magnitude, we find a rigorous lower bound on the accuracy threshold higher
by a factor of five than for the case of unbiased noise.

  Due to the Jamiolkowski isomorphism, the results obtained for quantum maps

  Noise: The Effects Of Syndrome Extraction in the Long Time Limit</title><description>  We analyze the long time behavior of a quantum computer running a quantum
error correction (QEC) code in the presence of a correlated environment.
Starting from a Hamiltonian formulation of realistic noise models, and assuming
that QEC is indeed possible, we find formal expressions for the probability of
a faulty path and the residual decoherence encoded in the reduced density
matrix. Systems with non-zero gate times (``long gates'') are included in our
analysis by using an upper bound on the noise. In order to introduce the local
error probability for a qubit, we assume that propagation of signals through
the environment is slower than the QEC period (hypercube assumption). This
allows an explicit calculation in the case of a generalized spin-boson model
and a quantum frustration model. The key result is a dimensional criterion: If
the correlations decay sufficiently fast, the system evolves toward a
stochastic error model for which the threshold theorem of fault-tolerant
quantum computation has been proven. On the other hand, if the correlations
decay slowly, the traditional proof of this threshold theorem does not hold.
This dimensional criterion bears many similarities to criteria that occur in
the theory of quantum phase transitions.

based on the weak Kerr effect. Two photonic qubits modulate the phase of a
coherent state, and a quadrature measurement of the coherent state reveals the
parity of the two qubits without destroying the photons. This can be used to
create so-called cluster states, a universal resource for quantum computing.
Here, the effect of self-phase modulation on the parity gate is studied,
introducing generating functions for the Wigner function of a modulated
coherent state. For materials with non-EIT-based Kerr nonlinearities, there is
typically a self-phase modulation that is half the magnitude of the cross-phase
modulation. Therefore, this effect cannot be ignored. It is shown that for a
large class of physical implementations of the phase modulation, the quadrature
measurement cannot distinguish between odd and even parity. Consequently, weak
nonlinear parity gates must be implemented with physical systems where the
self-phase modulation is negligable.

encodings involve operations on exponentially large matrices. However, we show
that in some cases it is possible to find such encodings with only partial

correctable encodings for a twirled channel are also correctable for the
original channel. We investigate the particular case of twirling over the set

operation can be characterized experimentally in a scalable manner. We also

rotations become synchronized with the oscillator phase. In the synchronized
regime, at certain parameters, the qubit exhibits tunneling between two

The life times in these metastable states can be enormously large. The

shown that the Shannon entropy of the classical key necessary to securely
transfer the quantum information is lower bounded by the entropy exchange of
the private quantum channel $\cal E$ and von Neumann entropy of the ciphertext
state $\varrho^{(0)}$. Based on these bounds we have shown that decomposition
of private quantum channels into orthogonal unitaries (if exists) is optimizing
the entropy. For non-ancillary single qubit PQC we have derived the optimal
entropy for arbitrary set of plaintexts. In particular, we have shown that
except when the (closure of the) set of plaintexts contains all states, one bit
key is sufficient. We characterized and analyzed all the possible single qubit
private quantum channels for arbitrary set of plaintexts. For the set of
plaintexts consisting of all qubit states we have characterized all possible
approximate private quantum channels and we have derived the relation between
the security parameter and the corresponding minimal entropy.

can be used to manipulate quantum metastability of a system. We study
metastability of a particle trapped in a well with a time-periodically
oscillating barrier in the Floquet formalism. It is shown that the oscillating
barrier causes the system to decay faster in general. However, avoided
crossings of metastable states can occur with the less stable states crossing
over to the more stable ones. If in the static well there exists a bound state,
then it is possible to stabilize a metastable state by adiabatically increasing
the oscillating frequency of the barrier so that the unstable state eventually
cross-over to the stable bound state. It is also found that increasing the
amplitude of the oscillating field may change a direct crossing of states into
an avoided one. Hence, one can manipulate the stability of different states in
a quantum potential by a combination of adiabatic changes of the frequency and
the amplitude of the oscillating barrier.

Specifically, we consider a laser involving a single electron permanently

  control using gradient ascent</title><description>  We use the numerical gradient ascent method from optimal control theory to
extend efficient photon storage in Lambda-type media to previously inaccessible
regimes and to provide simple intuitive explanations for our optimization
techniques. In particular, by using gradient ascent to shape classical control
pulses used to mediate photon storage, we open up the possibility of high
efficiency photon storage in the non-adiabatic limit, in which analytical
solutions to the equations of motion do not exist. This control shaping
technique enables an order-of-magnitude increase in the bandwidth of the
memory. We also demonstrate that the often discussed connection between time
reversal and optimality in photon storage follows naturally from gradient
ascent. Finally, we discuss the optimization of controlled reversible
inhomogeneous broadening.

set, including all two- and three-bit binary gates (e.g., NAND, 3-majority).
The algorithm is optimal on read-once formulas for which each gate's inputs are
balanced in a certain sense.
  The main new tool is a correspondence between a classical linear-algebraic
model of computation, &quot;span programs,&quot; and weighted bipartite graphs. A span
program's evaluation corresponds to an eigenvalue-zero eigenvector of the
associated graph. A quantum computer can therefore evaluate the span program by
applying spectral estimation to the graph.
  For example, the classical complexity of evaluating the balanced ternary
majority formula is unknown, and the natural generalization of randomized
alpha-beta pruning is known to be suboptimal. In contrast, our algorithm
generalizes the optimal quantum AND-OR formula evaluation algorithm and is
optimal for evaluating the balanced ternary majority formula.

convolution-bound $n$-tuples, but the $n$-tuples cannot be regarded as vectors
since the formalism is basis dependent. This is why HRR cannot be associated
with geometric structures. Replacing convolutions by geometric products one
arrives at reduced representations analogous to HRR but interpretable in terms
of geometry. Variable bindings occurring in both HRR and its geometric analogue
mathematically correspond to two different representations of
$Z_2\times...\times Z_2$ (the additive group of binary $n$-tuples with addition
modulo 2). As opposed to standard HRR, variable binding performed by means of
geometric product allows for computing exact inverses of all nonzero vectors, a
procedure even simpler than approximate inverses employed in HRR. The formal
structure of the new reduced representation is analogous to cartoon
computation, a geometric analogue of quantum computation.

turnstile. It has been known that SR emerges by the cooperation of a weak
periodic signal and noise in a bistable system. A periodic signal produces
switching between two stable states by lowering the potential barrier. Even if
the amplitude of the signal is not large enough to make the potential barrier
disappear, the switching can occur with the help of noise. As a result, an
output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which shows how much the switching is
synchronized with the signal, can be enhanced by increasing the noise. We have
formulated the SR in a single electron turnstile into the adiabatic two-state
theory of McNamara-Wiesenfeld and confirmed its manifestation by numerical
simulation. These results could be applied to detection of the periodic motion
of very small electric charge under noisy environment.

set of scalars $\lambda$ such that $PAP = \lambda P$ for some rank $k$
orthogonal projection $P$. In this paper, a close connection between low rank
perturbation of an operator $A$ and $\Lambda_k(A)$ is established. In
particular, for $1 \le r &lt; k$ it is shown that $\Lambda_k(A) \subseteq
\Lambda_{k-r}(A+F)$ for any operator $F$ with $\rank (F) \le r$. In quantum
computing, this result implies that a quantum channel with a $k$-dimensional
error correcting code under a perturbation of rank $\le r$ will still have a
$(k-r)$-dimensional error correcting code. Moreover, it is shown that if $A$ is
normal or if the dimension of $A$ is finite, then $\Lambda_k(A)$ can be
obtained as the intersection of $\Lambda_{k-r}(A+F)$ for a collection of rank
$r$ operators $F$. Examples are given to show that the result fails if $A$ is a

are completely determined. Analogous results are obtained for
$\Lambda_\infty(A)$ defined as the set of scalars $\lambda$ such that $PAP =
\lambda P$ for an infinite rank orthogonal projection $P$. It is shown that
$\Lambda_\infty(A)$ is the intersection of all $\Lambda_k(A)$ for $k = 1, 2,

origin rooted in the geometry of three-dimensional physical space. Our approach
to the quantum/classical interface is based on a formulation of relativistic
classical mechanics that uses spinors. Spinors and projectors arise naturally
in the Clifford's geometric algebra of physical space and not only provide
powerful tools for solving problems in classical electrodynamics, but also
reproduce a number of quantum results. In particular, many properites of
elementary fermions, as spin-1/2 particles, are obtained classically and relate
spin, the associated g-factor, its coupling to an external magnetic field, and
its magnetic moment to Zitterbewegung and de Broglie waves. The relationship is
further strengthened by the fact that physical space and its geometric algebra
can be derived from fermion annihilation and creation operators. The approach
resolves Pauli's argument against treating time as an operator by recognizing
phase factors as projected rotation operators.

As in open space, when the optical potential is sufficiently deep, the atomic

Each channel can serve as a resource for, e.g. independent quantum key

First, we introduce the class two-mode squeezed symmetric superposition of Fock
states, including finite truncations of twin-beam Gaussian states as special
realizations. These states depend on a set of free independent parameters that
can be adjusted for the optimization of teleportation protocols, with an
enhancement of the success probability of teleportation both for coherent and
Fock input states. We show that the optimization procedure reduces the
entangled resources to truncated twin beam states, which thus represents an
optimal class of non-Gaussian resources for quantum teleportation. We then
introduce a further class of two-mode non-Gaussian entangled resources, in the
form of squeezed cat-like states. We analyze the performance and the properties
of such states when optimized for (CV) teleportation, and compare them to the
optimized squeezed Bell-like states introduced in a previous work
\cite{CVTelepNoi}. We discuss how optimal resources for teleportation are
characterized by a suitable balance of entanglement content and squeezed vacuum
affinity. We finally investigate the effects of thermal noise on the efficiency
of quantum teleportation. To this aim, a convenient framework is to describe
noisy entangled resources as linear superpositions of non-Gaussian state and
thermal states. Although the presence of the thermal component strongly reduces
the teleportation fidelity, noisy non-Gaussian states remain preferred
resources when compared to noisy twin-beam Gaussian states.

These topological obstructions are closely related to obstructions to the
existence of exponentially localized Wannier functions. We show that by taking
two copies of a gapped, free fermionic system with complex conjugate

us to write the ground state in matrix product form using Grassman-valued bond

universal physical simulation procedure. Much of the writing about quantum
logic circuits and quantum Turing machines has shown how these machines can
simulate an arbitrary unitary transformation on a finite number of qubits. The
problem of universality has been addressed most famously in a paper by Deutsch,
and later by Bernstein and Vazirani as well as Kitaev and Solovay. The quantum
logic circuit model, developed by Feynman and Deutsch, has been more prominent
in the research literature than Deutsch's quantum Turing machines. Quantum
Turing machines form a class closely related to deterministic and probabilistic
Turing machines and one might hope to find a universal machine in this class. A
universal machine is the basis of a notion of programmability. The extent to
which universality has in fact been established by the pioneers in the field is
examined and this key notion in theoretical computer science is scrutinised in
quantum computing by distinguishing various connotations and concomitant
results and problems.

only be tested if large amount of data is available a claim has been made that
QT provides the most complete description of an individual physical system.
Einstein's opposition to this claim and the paradox he presented in the article
written together with Podolsky and Rosen in 1935 inspired generations of
physicists in their quest for better understanding of QT. Seventy years after
EPR article it is clear that without deep understanding of the character and
limitations of QT one may not hope to find a meaningful unified theory of all
physical interactions, manipulate qubits or construct a quantum computer. In
this paper we present shortly the EPR paper and the discussion which followed
it. By emphasizing the difference between quantum phenomena and hypothetical
invisible sub phenomena we show that paradoxes are only found if incorrect
models of sub phenomena are used. The violation of Bell and CHSH inequalities
demonstrate clearly that &quot;an entangled pair of photons&quot; resembles neither &quot;a
pair of Bertlmann's socks&quot; nor &quot;a pair of fair and random dices&quot;. Finally we
rephrase the EPR question by asking whether QT provides the complete

These states remain entangled through proper traces to states for a smaller

Assuming a weak coupling of the impurity atoms to the BEC, we derive a quantum
master equation for the lattice system. In the special case of fixed impurities
with two internal states the atoms represent a quantum register and the quantum
master equation reproduces the exact evolution of the qubits. We characterise
the qubit dephasing which is caused by the interspecies coupling and show that
the effect of sub- and superdecoherence is observable for realistic
experimental parameters. Furthermore, the BEC phonons mediate an attractive
interaction between the impurities, which has an important impact on their
spatial distribution. If the lattice atoms are allowed to move, there occurs a
sharp transition with the impurities aggregating in a macroscopic cluster at
experimentally achievable temperatures. We also investigate the impact of the
BEC on the transport properties of the impurity atoms and show that a crossover

described in analogy to the `two-mode squeezing' of quantum optics in terms of
an su(1,1) algebra. In this system the initial m_F=0 condensate acts as a

though the system as a whole is described by a pure state with zero entropy,
the reduced density matrix for the m_F = +1 degree of freedom, obtained by
tracing out the m_F = -1,0 degrees of freedom, corresponds to a thermal state.

75, 032326 [2007] and arXiv:0704.3723) by, first, obtaining numerical estimates
of the separability function based on the (Euclidean, flat) Hilbert-Schmidt
(HS) metric for the 27-dimensional convex set of quaternionic two-qubit
systems. The estimated function appears to be strongly consistent with our
previously-formulated Dyson-index (beta = 1, 2, 4) ansatz, dictating that the
quaternionic (beta=4) separability function should be exactly proportional to
the square of the separability function for the 15-dimensional convex set of
two-qubit complex (beta=2) systems, as well as the fourth power of the
separability function for the 9-dimensional convex set of two-qubit real
(beta=1) systems. In particular, we conclude that S_{quat}(mu) =(6/71)^2
((3-mu^2) mu)^4 =(S_{complex}(mu))^2. Here, mu =(rho_{11} rho_{44}/(rho_{22}
rho_{33})^(1/2), where rho is a 4 x 4 two-qubit density matrix. We can, thus,
supplement (and fortify) our previous assertion that the HS separability
probability of the two-qubit complex states is 8/33= 0.242424, by claiming that
its quaternionic counterpart is 72442944/936239725 = 0.0773765. We also comment

prediction for a single measurement or for a single time -series of events
observed for a trapped ion, electron or any other individual physical system.
The predictions of QT being of probabilistic character apply to the statistical
distribution of the results obtained in various experiments. The probability
distribution is not an attribute of a dice but it is a characteristic of a
whole random experiment : '' rolling a dice''. and statistical long range
correlations between two random variables X and Y are not a proof of any causal
relation between these variable. Moreover any probabilistic model used to
describe a random experiment is consistent only with a specific protocol
telling how the random experiment has to be performed.In this sense the quantum
theory is a statistical and contextual theory of phenomena. In this paper we
discuss these important topics in some detail. Besides we discuss in historical
perspective various prerequisites used in the proofs of Bell and CHSH
inequalities concluding that the violation of these inequalities in spin
polarization correlation experiments is neither a proof of the completeness of
QT nor of its nonlocality. The question whether QT is predictably complete is
still open and it should be answered by a careful and unconventional analysis
of the experimental data. It is sufficient to analyze more in detail the
existing experimental data by using various non-parametric purity tests and
other specific statistical tools invented to study the fine structure of the
time-series. The correct understanding of statistical and contextual character

derived. For isolated resonance states $\lambda$, this expression gives the
fundamental relation $\tau_\lambda = \hbar / \Gamma_\lambda$ between life time

obtained for narrow resonances superposed by a smooth background term. In the

This conclusion holds independently of the orientation of the plates. We review
these arguments and add further support to this conclusion by considering
parallel semitransparent plates, that is, $\delta$-function potentials, acting
on a massless scalar field, in a spacetime defined by Rindler coordinates. We
calculate the force on systems consisting of one or two such plates undergoing
acceleration perpendicular to the plates. In the limit of small acceleration we
recover (via the equivalence principle) the situation of weak gravity, and find
that the gravitational force on the system is just $M\mathbf{g}$, where
$\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration and $M$ is the total mass of the
system, consisting of the mass of the plates renormalized by the Casimir energy
of each plate separately, plus the energy of the Casimir interaction between
the plates. This reproduces the previous result in the limit as the coupling to
the $\delta$-function potential approaches infinity. Extension of this latter
work to arbitrary orientation of the plates, and to general compact quantum

asymptotic state discrimination, we investigate the distinguishability of two
bipartite mixed states under the constraint of local operations and classical
communication (LOCC), in the limit of many copies. While for two pure states a
result of Walgate et al. shows that LOCC is just as powerful as global
measurements, data hiding states (DiVincenzo et al.) show that locality can
impose severe restrictions on the distinguishability of even orthogonal states.
Here we determine the optimal error probability and measurement to discriminate
many copies of particular data hiding states (extremal d x d Werner states) by
a linear programming approach. Surprisingly, the single-copy optimal
measurement remains optimal for n copies, in the sense that the best strategy
is measuring each copy separately, followed by a simple classical decision
rule. We also put a lower bound on the bias with which states can be
distinguished by separable operations.

Starting from a cavity QED single atom Hamiltonian we use different routes to

quantum uncertainties of the potential and the possibility of atom-field

excitation spectra are analyzed as a function of the strength of the magnetic

molecules. For certain ranges of dot parameters (mainly at strong anisotropy),
the Wigner molecules acquire a linear geometry, and the associated wave
functions with a spin projection S_z=1/2 are similar to the representative
class of strongly entangled states referred to as W-states. For other ranges of

more complex structure consisting of two mirror isosceles triangles. This
latter structure can be viewed as an embryonic unit of a zig-zag Wigner crystal

This effect can be attributed to the fact that the fluctuation spectrum for

quite different for the same unitary dynamics in the same situation in the
larger system. An affine form is used for both kinds of maps to find necessary

same homogeneous part in their affine forms have inverses if and only if the
homogeneous part does. Some of these maps are completely positive; others are
not, but the homogeneous part is always completely positive. The conditions for
an inverse are the same for maps that are not completely positive as for maps

their similarities to superpositions of coherent states (SCSs) with small

Gaussian states, limited transmittivity of the beam splitter and the avalanche
photodetector which cannot resolve photon numbers. As a result of this
analysis, the degrees of mixedness and the beam splitter transmittivity that
can be allowed for successful tests of Bell inequalities are revealed.

system and then measuring the position of the pointer. If the initial
wavefunction for the pointer is real, the mean displacement of the pointer is
proportional to the so-called weak value of the observable being measured. This
gives an intuitively direct way of understanding weak measurement. However, if
the initial pointer wavefunction takes complex values, the relationship between
pointer displacement and weak value is not quite so simple, as pointed out
recently by R. Jozsa. This is even more striking in the case of sequential weak
measurements. These are carried out by coupling several pointers at different
stages of evolution of the system, and the relationship between the products of
the measured pointer positions and the sequential weak values can become
extremely complicated for an arbitrary initial pointer wavefunction.
Surprisingly, all this complication vanishes when one calculates the cumulants
of pointer positions. These are directly proportional to the cumulants of
sequential weak values. This suggests that cumulants have a fundamental
physical significance for weak measurement.

accessible conditions that distinguish between various classes and levels of
partial separability in a hierarchical order. These conditions take the form of
bounds on the correlations of locally orthogonal observables. Violations of
such inequalities give strong sufficient criteria for various forms of partial
inseparability and multiqubit entanglement. The strength of these criteria is
illustrated by showing that they are stronger than several other well-known
entanglement criteria (the fidelity criterion, violation of Mermin-type
separability inequalities, the Laskowski-\.Zukowski criterion and the
D\&quot;ur-Cirac criterion), and also by showing their great noise robustness for a
variety of multiqubit states, including N-qubit GHZ states and Dicke states.
Furthermore, for N greater than or equal to 3 they can detect bound entangled
states. For all these states, the required number of measurement settings for
implementation of the entanglement criteria is shown to be only N+1. If one
chooses the familiar Pauli matrices as single-qubit observables, the
inequalities take the form of bounds on the anti-diagonal matrix elements of a

Sagnac interferometric down-conversion source and its generation of narrowband,
high-visibility polarization-entangled photons. Driven by a narrowband,
mode-locked pump at 390.35 nm, the phase-stable Sagnac source with a type-II
phase-matched periodically poled KTiOPO$_4$ crystal is capable of producing
0.01 entangled pair per pulse in a 0.15-nm bandwidth centered at 780.7 nm with
1 mW of average pump power at a repetition rate of 31.1 MHz. We have achieved a
mean photon-pair generation rate of as high as 0.7 pair per pulse, at which
multi-pair events dominate and significantly reduce the two-photon
quantum-interference visibility. For low generation probability $\alpha$, the
reduced visibility $V=1-\alpha$ is independent of the throughput efficiency and
of the polarization analysis basis, which can be utilized to yield an accurate
estimate of the generation rate $\alpha$. At low $\alpha$ we have characterized
the source entanglement quality in three different ways: average
quantum-interference visibility of 99%, the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt $S$
parameter of $2.739 \pm 0.119$, and quantum state tomography with 98.85%
singlet-state fidelity. The narrowband pulsed Sagnac source of entangled
photons is suitable for use in quantum information processing applications such
as free-space quantum key distribution.

singly occupied site for a filling factor two, change the dynamics of Frenkel
excitons and cavity polaritons. While the vacancies in first case behave like
hard sphere scatters for excitons, singly occupied sites in the latter case can

However, the generic non-Markovian trajectories are mixed state trajectories.

Contrary to my suggestion there, the given continuous measurement schemes

beam with well defined incident velocity is suddenly removed, the density
profile develops during the time evolution an oscillatory pattern known as
diffraction in time. The interference fringes are suppressed or their
visibility is diminished by several effects such as averaging over a
distribution of incident velocities, apodization of the aperture function,
atom-atom interactions, imperfect reflection or environmental noise. However,
when the mirror moves with finite velocity along the direction of propagation
of the beam, the visibility of the fringes is enhanced. For mirror velocities
below beam velocity, as used for slowing down the beam, the matter wave splits
into three regions separated by space-time points with classical analogues. For
mirror velocities above beam velocity a visibility enhancement occurs without a
classical counterpart. When the velocity of the beam approaches that of the
mirror the density oscillations rise by a factor 1.8 over the stationary value.

combined with a suitable ontology, provides an explanation of quantum
mechanics. The so-called collapse of the wave function is problematic in
conventional quantum theory but not in the GRW theory, in which it is governed
by a stochastic law. A possible ontology is the flash ontology, according to
which matter consists of random points in space-time, called flashes. The joint
distribution of these points, a point process in space-time, is the topic of
this work. The mathematical results concern mainly the existence and uniqueness
of this distribution for several variants of the theory. Particular attention
is paid to the relativistic version of the GRW theory that I developed in 2004.

This
is achieved by introducing two symmetric entanglement cloning machines (or
e-cloners): a local e-cloner and a global e-cloner; where we look at the
preservation of entanglement in the clones under the condition that the
fidelity of the clones is maximized. These cloning machines are implemented
using simple linear optical elements such as beam splitters and homodyne
detection along with squeeze gates. We show that the global e-cloner
out-performs the local e-cloner both in terms of the fidelity of the cloned
states as well as the strength of the entanglement of the clones. There is a
minimum strength of entanglement (3dB for the inseparability criterion and
5.7dB for the EPR paradox criterion) of the input state of the global e-cloner
that is required to preserve the entanglement in the clones.

  monotones</title><description>  Every restriction on quantum operations defines a resource theory,
determining how quantum states that cannot be prepared under the restriction
may be manipulated and used to circumvent the restriction. A superselection
rule is a restriction that arises through the lack of a classical reference
frame and the states that circumvent it (the resource) are quantum reference
frames. We consider the resource theories that arise from three types of
superselection rule, associated respectively with lacking: (i) a phase
reference, (ii) a frame for chirality, and (iii) a frame for spatial
orientation. Focussing on pure unipartite quantum states (and in some cases
restricting our attention even further to subsets of these), we explore
single-copy and asymptotic manipulations. In particular, we identify the
necessary and sufficient conditions for a deterministic transformation between
two resource states to be possible and, when these conditions are not met, the
maximum probability with which the transformation can be achieved. We also
determine when a particular transformation can be achieved reversibly in the
limit of arbitrarily many copies and find the maximum rate of conversion. A
comparison of the three resource theories demonstrates that the extent to which
resources can be interconverted decreases as the strength of the restriction
increases. Along the way, we introduce several measures of frameness and prove
that these are monotonically nonincreasing under various classes of operations
that are permitted by the superselection rule.

entanglement. As announced in [Brandao and Plenio, Nature Physics 4, 8 (2008)],
and in stark contrast to the manipulation of entanglement under local
operations and classical communication, the entanglement shared by two or more
parties can be reversibly interconverted in this setting. The unique
entanglement measure is identified as the regularized relative entropy of
entanglement, which is shown to be equal to a regularized and smoothed version
of the logarithmic robustness of entanglement.
  Here we give a rigorous proof of this result, which is fundamentally based on
a certain recent extension of quantum Stein's Lemma proved in [Brandao and
Plenio, Commun. Math. 295, 791 (2010)], giving the best measurement strategy
for discriminating several copies of an entangled state from an arbitrary
sequence of non-entangled states, with an optimal distinguishability rate equal
to the regularized relative entropy of entanglement. We moreover analyse the
connection of our approach to axiomatic formulations of the second law of
thermodynamics.

spherically symmetric and the position operator does not transform as a vector,
so that previous non-existence arguments do not apply. We find two classes of
position eigenvectors and obtain photon wave functions by projection onto the
bases of position eigenkets that they define, following the usual rules of
quantum mechanics. The hermitian position operator, r0, leads to a
Landau-Peierls wave function, while field-like eigenvectors of the nonhermitian
position operator and its adjoint lead to a biorthonormal basis. These two
bases are equivalent in the sense that they are related by a similarity
transformation. The eigenvectors of the nonhermitian position operators lead to
a field-potential wave function pair. These field-like positive frequency wave
functions satisfy Maxwell's equations, and thus justify the supposition that
MEs describe single photon wave mechanics. The expectation value of the number
operator is photon density with undetected photons integrated over, consistent
with Feynman's conclusion that the density of non-interacting particles can be

phenomenological model for a rough conductor, that explicitly takes account of
the fact that ohmic conduction in the immediate vicinity of the surface of a

is smaller than the skin depth. As a result of the new model, we find that
surface roughness strongly influences the magnitude of the thermal correction

consistent with recent accurate measurements of the Casimir force in the

quantum states from multiple senders to a single receiver with a previously
shared stabilizer state. In the model we considered, the utilized stabilizer
state is partitioned into several subsystems and then each subsystem is
distributed to a distinct party. We present two sufficient conditions for a
stabilizer state to achieve a given nonzero teleportation capacity with respect
to a given partition plan. The corresponding teleportation protocols are also
explicitly given. Interestingly, we find that even mixed stabilizer states are
also useful for perfect many-to-one teleportation. Finally, our work provides a
new perspective from stabilizer formalism to view the standard teleportation
protocol and also suggests a new technique for analyzing teleportation
capability of multipartite entangled states.

  pairs pumps</title><description>  When physical systems are tunable by three classical parameters, level
degeneracies may occur at isolated points in parameter space. A topological
singularity in the phase of the degenerate eigenvectors exists at these points.
When a path encloses such point, the accumulated geometrical phase is sensitive
to its presence. Furthermore, surfaces in parameter space enclosing such point
can be used to characterize the eigenvector singularities through their Chern
indices, which are integers. They can be used to quantize a physical quantity
of interest. This quantity changes continuously during an adiabatic evolution
along a path in parameter space. Quantization requires to turn this path into a
surface with a well defined Chern index. We analyze the conditions necessary to
a {\em Topological Quantization by Controlled Paths}. It is applied to Cooper
pair pumps. For more general problems, a set of four criteria are proposed to
check if topological quantization is possible.

effect. First we write the Casimir energy as a sum over the modes of a real
cavity. We may identify two sorts of modes, two evanescent surface plasmon
modes and propagative modes. As one of the surface plasmon modes becomes
propagative for some choice of parameters we adopt an adiabatic mode definition
where we follow this mode into the propagative sector and count it together
with the surface plasmon contribution, calling this contribution &quot;plasmonic&quot;.
The remaining modes are propagative cavity modes, which we call &quot;photonic&quot;. The
Casimir energy contains two main contributions, one coming from the plasmonic,
the other from the photonic modes. Surprisingly we find that the plasmonic
contribution to the Casimir energy becomes repulsive for intermediate and large
mirror separations. Alternatively, we discuss the common surface plasmon
defintion, which includes only evanescent waves, where this effect is not
found. We show that, in contrast to an intuitive expectation, for both
definitions the Casimir energy is the sum of two very large contributions which
nearly cancel each other. The contribution of surface plasmons to the Casimir
energy plays a fundamental role not only at short but also at large distances.

in Maxwell's equations viewed as the wave equation for photons. In a medium
containing ``inverted energy populations'' of excited atoms, e.g. in a LASER

essential postulates of a quantum framework capable of incorporating
gravitational phenomena. Such a construct likely requires elimination or
modification of some of the &quot;standard&quot; postulates of quantum mechanics, in

framework that appears sufficiently general to incorporate some expected
features of quantum gravity. These include the statement that space and time
may only emerge approximately and relationally. One perspective on such a
framework is as a sort of generalization of the S-matrix approach to dynamics.
Within this framework, more dynamical structure is required to fully specify a

quantum field theory. Some aspects of this structure are discussed, both in the
context of scattering of perturbations about a flat background, and in the

Long-range correlations develop in the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) phase
transition and the aim here is to find out whether spatial coherence alone
implies entanglement. We use a purity measure of entanglement to derive an
entanglement witness that detects entanglement between two regions of space in
the BEC. It is shown that spatial coherence between the two regions is
necessary for entanglement with coherence and entanglement becoming equivalent
only when the regions occupy the entire confining volume of the gas. The
probabilities for Bosons to occupy the regions is the only other parameter that
influences the amount of entanglement. We calculate explicitly the amount of
entanglement between two regions for a cigar-shaped harmonic potential and find
that it increases with decreasing temperature. A second entanglement witness is
derived for entanglement between three regions of space, where again spatial
coherence between each pair of regions is precursor to entanglement. It is
shown that the state with the maximum amount of entanglement occurs when the
probabilities for the Bosons to occupy the three regions are equal.

Object-pointer entanglement and decoherence of distinct pointer readouts

Initially, object and apparatus are statistically independent while the latter

Hamiltonian operator $H$ but an operator $H'$ which differs from $H$ if the
metric operator is time-dependent. In the latter case this effective
Hamiltonian $H'$ is not observable. This is consistent with the conclusions of
my paper [Phys. Lett. B 650, 208 (2007), arXiv:0706.1872v2] which allow for
unitary time-evolution generated by unobservable Hamiltonians.

proposed as a tool to reveal the parity violating anapole moment of its
nucleus. It should also result in splitting the D2 optical excitation line in a
way depending on the light polarization. An experimental investigation has been
set up using oriented hcp helium crystals in which cesium metal grains are
embedded. Atoms are created by laser sputtering from this grains. Optical
absorption spectra of the D2 line have been recorded in the temperature range
of 1.0 to 1.4 K at liquid/solid coexistence pressure by monitoring the
fluorescence on the D2 line at 950 nm. No significant effect of the light
polarization has been found, suggesting a statistically isotropic disordered

for $N$ qubits to be performed in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) quantum
computer. This can be used to simulate or predict results for different Bell's
inequalities tests, with distinct configurations and larger number of qubits.
To demonstrate our scheme, we implemented a simulation of the violation of
Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt (CHSH) inequality using a two qubit NMR system
and compared the results to those of a photon experiment. The experimental
results are well described by Quantum Mechanics theory and a Local Realistic
Hidden Variables model which was specially developed for NMR. That is why we
refer to this experiment as a {\it simulation} of the Bell's inequality
violation. Our result shows explicitly how both theories can be compatible to
each other due the detection loophole. In the last part of this work we discuss
the possibility of testing fundamental features of quantum mechanics using NMR
with highly polarized spins, where a strong discrepancy between quantum
mechanics and hidden variables models can be expected.

Foundations of Quantum Mechanics.
  Purpose of this review is to introduce qudits, to summarize their application
to Quantum Communication and researches on Local Realism and, finally, to
describe some recent experiment for realizing them.
  A Little more in details: after a short introduction, we will consider the
advantages of testing local realism with qudits, discussing both the 3-4
dimensional case (both for maximally and non-maximally entanglement) and then
the extension to an arbitrary dimension. Afterwards, we will discuss the
theoretical results on using qudits for quantum communication, epitomizing the
outcomes on a larger security in Quantum Key Distribution protocols (again
considering separately qutrits, ququats and generalization to arbitrary
dimension). Finally, we will present the experiments performed up to now for
producing quantum optical qudits and their applications. In particular, we will
mention schemes based on interferometric set-ups, orbital angular momentum
entanglement and biphoton polarization. Finally, we will summarize what
hyperentanglement is and its applications.

solid, we have carried out a high-field nuclear magnetic resonance study of the
longitudinal and transverse spin relaxation of the lead nuclei from room
temperature down to 10 K for powder samples of lead titanate (PT), lead
zirconium titanate (PZT), and a PT monocrystal. For all powder samples and
independently of temperature, transverse relaxation times were found to be
$T_2\approx 1.5 $ms, while the longitudinal relaxation times exhibited a
temperature dependence, with $T_1$ of over an hour at the lowest temperatures,
decreasing to $T_1\approx 7 $s at room temperature. At high temperatures, the
observed behavior is consistent with a two-phonon Raman process, while in the
low temperature limit, the relaxation appears to be dominated by a
single-phonon (direct) process involving magnetic impurities. This is the first
study of temperature-dependent nuclear-spin relaxation in PT and PZT
ferroelectrics at such low temperatures. We discuss the implications of the

bath correlation time scale being smaller than the pulse duration the dynamics

Shor's factoring algorithm and Grover's search algorithm, and on the amount of
interference in these algorithms using a recently proposed interference
measure. We consider systematic unitary errors, random unitary errors, and
decoherence processes. We show that unitary errors which destroy the
interference destroy the efficiency of the algorithm, too. However, unitary
errors may also create useless additional interference. In such a case the
total amount of interference can increase, while the efficiency of the quantum
computation decreases. For decoherence due to phase flip errors, interference
is destroyed for small error probabilities, and converted into destructive
interference for error probabilities approaching one, leading to success
probabilities which can even drop below the classical value. Our results show
that in general interference is necessary in order for a quantum algorithm to
outperform classical computation, but large amounts of interference are not
sufficient and can even lead to destructive interference with worse than
classical success rates.

expectation values of products of (quantum-) electric-field operators. More
precisely, the output of BHDs provides information on the one- and two-point

electron and phonons (comprising a thermal bath) couple quantum mechanically to
perform coherent oscillations with periods in the range of tens of nanoseconds,
despite the finite temperature of the phonon bath. Mechanical energy
dissipation due to clamping loss is taken into account in the calculations.
Although the lifetime of the coupled el-ph states decreases with the
temperature, well defined Rabi oscillations are obtained for temperatures up to
100 mK. The dynamics of the coupled electron-phonon state is susceptible to
various forms of external control. For instance, a weak external magnetic field
can be used to control the dynamics of the system, by decoupling the electron
from the phonon bath. The results cast light upon the underlying physics of a

are located at the remote stations respectively. Employing off-line four-mode
entanglement, homodyne detection, classical communication and local
displacement, the nonlocal nondegenerate optical parametric amplifier can be
achieved. This scheme can be implemented with a setup that is experimentally
accessible at present.

Einstein-Podosky-Rosen polarization-entangled photon pairs. A four-level tripod
atom successively couples to two high-Q optical cavities possessing
polarization degeneracy, assisted by a classical $\pi$-polarized pump field.
The stimulated Raman adiabatic passage process in the atom-cavity system is

unitary evolution operator to a Hilbert space corresponding to the graph.
Hitting times for discrete quantum walks on graphs give an average time before
the walk reaches an ending condition. We derive an expression for hitting time
using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the walk on the hypercube
for various coins and decoherence models. We show that, by contrast to
classical walks, quantum walks can have infinite hitting times for some initial
states. We seek criteria to determine if a given walk on a graph will have
infinite hitting times, and find a sufficient condition for their existence.
The phenomenon of infinite hitting times is in general a consequence of the
symmetry of the graph and its automorphism group. Symmetries of a graph, given
by its automorphism group, can be inherited by the evolution operator. Using
the irreducible representations of the automorphism group, we derive conditions
such that quantum walks defined on this graph must have infinite hitting times
for some initial states. Symmetry can also cause the walk to be confined to a
subspace of the original Hilbert space for certain initial states. We show that
a quantum walk confined to the subspace corresponding to this symmetry group
can be seen as a different quantum walk on a smaller quotient graph and we give
an explicit construction of the quotient graph. We conjecture that the
existence of a small quotient graph with finite hitting times is necessary for
a walk to exhibit a quantum speed-up. Finally, we use symmetry and the theory
of decoherence-free subspaces to determine when the subspace of the quotient
graph is a decoherence-free subspace of the dynamics.

noise sources on the quantum transport and in particular model Markovian
decoherence via non-local coupling to nearby quantum point contacts which serve

requires that its basic tools and concepts obey the laws of physics. One of the
fundamental concepts in QC is the conditional quantum dynamics \cite{barenco},
some times called controlled-unitary operation \cite{kumar}, which is
established by the conditional &quot;If-Then&quot; sentence. The best know example is the
c-not gate, which operates on the computational basis as follows: \textit{If
the control qubit is set to $% |1&gt;$, then apply the single qubit quantum NOT
gate on the target. Otherwise, if the control qubit is set to $|0&gt;$, then the
target qubit is unchanged}. This gate represents the paradigm for the
conditional quantum dynamics, where the flipping of the target qubit is
conditioned to the state of the control qubit. Other gates have been defined in
a similar way of conditional evolution; for instance, the control phase gates
\cite{paulo1}. However, to the best of our knowledge, such conditional quantum
dynamics has not been yet used to define the SWAP gate. Here we propose a
possible conditional definition, in the form of If-Then sentence, to construct
a SWAP gate in the case of two qubits. This definition suggests a
classification in two classes, which depends upon the number of qubits that
have to undergo a conditional quantum dynamics.

state $e$ and a preferred determinate observable $R$. Topos-theoretic extension
is made in the functor category $\Sets^{\CcalR}$ of which base category
$\CcalR$ is determined by $R$. Each true atom, which determines truth values,
true or false, of all propositions in $\Dcal(e,R)$, generates also a
multi-valued valuation function of which domain and range are $\Lcal$ and a
Heyting algebra given by the subobject classifier in $\Sets^{\CcalR}$,
respectively. All true propositions in $\Dcal(e,R)$ are assigned the top
element of the Heyting algebra by the valuation function. False propositions
including the null proposition are, however, assigned values larger than the
bottom element. This defect can be removed by use of a subobject
semi-classifier. Furthermore, in order to treat all possible determinate
observables in a unified framework, another valuations are constructed in the
functor category $\Sets^{\Ccal}$. Here, the base category $\Ccal$ includes all
$\CcalR$'s as subcategories. Although $\Sets^{\Ccal}$ has a structure
apparently different from $\Sets^{\CcalR}$, a subobject semi-classifier of

Constructing a smooth switching function by gluing together a plateau and the

Indeed, it turns out that the result with a smooth switching function and the

dimensional version of the original model of a cloud chamber introduced by Mott

superpositions of mass eigenstates. By using the occupation number to define a
multiqubit space, the flavor states can be interpreted as multipartite
mode-entangled states. By exploiting a suitable global measure of entanglement,
based on the entropies related to all possible bipartitions of the system, we
analyze the correlation properties of such states in the instances of three-
and four-flavor mixing. Depending on the mixing parameters, and, in particular,
on the values taken by the free phases, responsible for the CP-violation,
entanglement concentrates in preferred bipartitions. We quantify in detail the
amount and the distribution of entanglement in the physically relevant cases of
flavor mixing in quark and neutrino systems. By using the wave packet
description for localized particles, we use the global measure of entanglement,
suitably adapted for the instance of multipartite mixed states, to analyze the
decoherence induced by the free evolution dynamics on the quantum correlations
of stationary neutrino beams. We define a decoherence length as the distance
associated with the vanishing of the coherent interference effects among
massive neutrino states. We investigate the role of the CP-violating phase in
the decoherence process.

Uhlmann holonomy. The general theory is illustrated for specific examples. We

that directly relates to the channel holonomy. Parallel transport condition and
concomitant gauge structure are delineated in the case of smoothly parametrized
families of channels. Finally, we point out that interferometer tests that have

s=1/2 Heisenberg chain. We have investigated the underlying quantum information
properties like the evolution of concurrence, entanglement entropy, nonanalytic
behaviours and the scaling close to the quantum critical point of the model.
Both the concurrence and the entanglement entropy develop two saturated values
after enough iterations of the renormalization of coupling constants. This
values are associated with the two different phases, i.e Neel and spin liquid
phases. The nonanalytic behaviour comes from the divergence of the first
derivative of both measures of entanglement as the size of system becomes
large. The renormalization scheme demonstrates how the minimum value of the
first derivative and its position scales with an exponent of the system size.
It is shown that this exponent is directly related to the critical properties
of the model, i.e. the exponent governing the divergence of the correlation
length close to the quantum critical point. We also use a renormalization
method based on the quantum group concept in order to get more insight about
the critical properties of the model and the renormalization of entanglement.

formula the genuine/finite part of the Casimir energy is determined as the
energy-weighted integral over the log-determinant of the multi-scattering

inherently shows that the Casimir energy is governed by the infrared end of the
multi-scattering phase shifts or spectrum of the fluctuating field. The
calculation is exact and in principle applicable for any separation(s) between
the obstacles. In practice, it is more suited for large- to medium-range

for quantum linear stochastic systems where the controller itself may also be a
quantum system and the plant output signal can be fully quantum. Such a control
scheme is often referred to in the quantum control literature as &quot;coherent
feedback control.'' It distinguishes the present work from previous works on
the quantum LQG problem where measurement is performed on the plant and the
measurement signals are used as input to a fully classical controller with no
quantum degrees of freedom. The difference in our formulation is the presence
of additional non-linear and linear constraints on the coefficients of the
sought after controller, rendering the problem as a type of constrained
controller design problem. Due to the presence of these constraints our problem
is inherently computationally hard and this also distinguishes it in an
important way from the standard LQG problem. We propose a numerical procedure
for solving this problem based on an alternating projections algorithm and, as
initial demonstration of the feasibility of this approach, we provide fully
quantum controller design examples in which numerical solutions to the problem
were successfully obtained. For comparison, we also consider the case of
classical linear controllers that use direct or indirect measurements, and show
that there exists a fully quantum linear controller which offers an improvement
in performance over the classical ones.

Tr \hat{\rho}^q]/[q-1]$ ($\hat{\rho}\equiv$ density matrix; $S_1=-k Tr
\hat{\rho} \ln \hat{\rho}$) can conform, for an anomalous value of q (i.e., q
not equal to 1), to the classical thermodynamical requirement for the entropy
to be extensive. Moreover, we find that the entropic index q provides a tool to
characterize both universal and nonuniversal aspects in quantum phase
transitions (e.g., for a L-sized block of the Ising ferromagnetic chain at its
T=0 critical transverse field, we obtain
$\lim_{L\to\infty}S_{\sqrt{37}-6}(L)/L=3.56 \pm 0.03$). The present results
suggest a new and powerful approach to measure entanglement in quantum
many-body systems. At the light of these results, and similar ones for a d=2
Bosonic system discussed by us elsewhere, we conjecture that, for blocks of
linear size L of a large class of Fermionic and Bosonic d-dimensional many-body
Hamiltonians with short-range interaction at T=0, we have that the additive
entropy $S_1(L) \propto [L^{d-1}-1]/(d-1)$ (i.e., $ \ln L$ for $d=1$, and $
L^{d-1}$ for d&gt;1), hence it is not extensive, whereas, for anomalous values of
the index q, we have that the nonadditive entropy $S_q(L)\propto L^d$ ($\forall
d$), i.e., it is extensive. The present discussion neatly illustrates that
entropic additivity and entropic extensivity are quite different properties,
even if they essentially coincide in the presence of short-range correlations.

which is supposed to be bound entangled. We study the problem of its two-copy
distillability, which boils down to show that maximal overlap of some projector
Q with Schmidt rank two states does not exceed 1/2. Such property we call the

for some classes of Schmidt rank two states b) bound the required overlap from
above for all Schmidt rank two states. We have succeeded to prove the

resonant nuclei is an ideal photonic crystal in nature. Plenty of extraordinary
observations are attributed to the collective down conversion of the multipolar
nuclear transition; in particular the spontaneous open up of photonic band gap.
Emissions of directionality depending on the macroscopic geometry manifest that
the standing wave is global in the polycrystalline sample. In this work,
further observations of the directional emissions are summarized. By applying
an external magnetic field at room temperature, not only the predicted
macroscopic nuclear polarization but also its strong directionality are
demonstrated. The standing wave lasts for more than hundred hours at room
temperature in the single crystal despite its natural half-life of one hour.
The so-called nuclear Raman Effect between two M4 transitions of 193mIr and
195mPt and the E3 transition of 103mRh is discovered, which gives the brand new
aspects to detect gravitational waves.

twofold and threefold symmetries. The latter was found to account better for
the spectral rigidity than the former. Both cases, however, underestimate the

is divided into two subspaces. One of them contains the wave functions
localized in a certain finite region while the continuum of extended scattering
wave functions is involved in the other subspace. The Hamilton operator of the
whole system is Hermitian, that of the localized part is, however,
non-Hermitian. This non-Hermitian Hamilton operator $H_{\rm eff}$ represents
the core of the FPO method in present-day studies. It gives a unified
description of discrete and resonance states. Furthermore, it contains the time
operator. The eigenvalues $z_\lambda$ and eigenfunctions $\phi_\lambda$ of
$H_{\rm eff}$ are an important ingredient of the $S$ matrix. They are energy
dependent. The phases of the $\phi_\lambda$ are, generally, nonrigid. Most
interesting physical effects are caused by the branch points in the complex
plane. On the one hand, they cause the avoided level crossings that appear as
level repulsion or widths bifurcation in approaching the branch points under
different conditions. On the other hand, observable values are usually enhanced
and accelerated in the vicinity of the branch points. In most cases, the theory
is time asymmetric. An exception are the ${\cal PT}$ symmetric bound states in
the continuum appearing in space symmetric systems due to the avoided level
crossing phenomenon in the complex plane. In the paper, the peculiarities of
the FPO method are considered and three typical phenomena are sketched: (i) the
unified description of decay and scattering processes, (ii) the appearance of
bound states in the continuum and (iii) the spectroscopic reordering processes
characteristic of the regime with overlapping resonances.

recently been proposed [B. Galvan: Found. Phys. 37, 1540-1562 (2007)]. Roughly
speaking, this rule states that if the wave function of a particle is split
into non-overlapping wave packets, the particle stays approximately inside the
support of one of the wave packets, without jumping to the others.
  In this paper a formal definition of this rule is given in terms of {\it
imprecise probability}. An imprecise probability space is a measurable space
$(\Omega, {\cal A})$ endowed with a {\it set} of probability measures $\cal P$.
The quantum formalism and the quantum typicality rule allow us to define a set
of probabilities ${\cal P}_\Psi$ on $(X^T, {\cal F})$, where $X$ is the
configuration space of a quantum system, $T$ is a time interval and ${\cal F}$
is the $\sigma$-algebra generated by the cylinder sets. Thus, it is proposed
that a quantum system can be represented as the {\it imprecise stochastic
process} $(X^T, {\cal F}, {\cal P}_\Psi)$, which is a canonical stochastic
process in which the single probability measure is replaced by a set of
measures. It is argued that this mathematical model, when used to represent
macroscopic systems, has sufficient predictive power to explain both the
results of the statistical experiments and the quasi-classical structure of the
macroscopic evolution.

of qubits (quantum bits). In reality, however, due to practical limitations,
the legitimate users are forced to employ a larger quantum (Hilbert) space, say
a quhexit (quantum six-dimensional) space, or even a much larger quantum
Hilbert space. Various specific attacks exploit of these limitations. Although
security can still be proved in some very special cases, a general framework
that considers such realistic QKD protocols, as well as} attacks on such
protocols, is still missing.
  We describe a general method of attacking realistic QKD protocols, which we
call the `quantum-space attack'. The description is based on assessing the
enlarged quantum space actually used by a protocol, the `quantum space of the
protocol'. We demonstrate these new methods by classifying various (known)
recent attacks against several QKD schemes, and by analyzing a novel attack on
interferometry-based QKD.

schemes. The first scheme is the standard one, induced by the local
relativistic fields; the alternative scheme that we consider is the one induced
by the Newton-Wigner operators. If degrees of freedom are divided according to
the latter, the Hamiltonian of the field exhibits a certain amount of
non-locality. Moreover, when a region of space is cut off from the rest
according to the Newton-Wigner scheme, the geometric entropy is finite and
exhibits a sensible thermodynamic behaviour.

certain detector pairs that would not become entangled in the corresponding de

slow down the decay of interference fringes and quantum correlations, while
strong non-Markovian effects resulting from an out-of-resonance bath can even
accelerate the loss of coherence, compared to predictions of Markovian

broken-symmetry phase to the unmagnetized ``symmetric'' polar phase. We
determine where the condensate goes out of equilibrium as it approaches the
critical point, and compute the condensate magnetization at the critical point.
This is done within a quantum Kibble-Zurek scheme traditionally employed in the
context of symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions. Then we study the
influence of the nonequilibrium dynamics near a critical point on the
condensate magnetization. In particular, when the quench stops at the critical
point, nonlinear oscillations of magnetization occur. They are characterized by
a period and an amplitude that are inversely proportional. If we keep driving
the condensate far away from the critical point through the unmagnetized
``symmetric'' polar phase, the amplitude of magnetization oscillations slowly
decreases reaching a non-zero asymptotic value. That process is described by
the equation that can be mapped onto the classical mechanical problem of a
particle moving under the influence of harmonic and ``anti-friction'' forces
whose interplay leads to surprisingly simple fixed-amplitude oscillations. We
obtain several scaling results relating the condensate magnetization to the
quench rate, and verify numerically all analytical predictions.

  Cryptography and Error Correction</title><description>  We make an explicit connection between fundamental notions in quantum
cryptography and quantum error correction. Error-correcting subsystems (and
subspaces) for quantum channels are the key vehicles for contending with noise
in physical implementations of quantum information-processing. Private
subsystems (and subspaces) for quantum channels play a central role in
cryptographic schemes such as quantum secret sharing and private quantum
communication. We show that a subsystem is private for a channel precisely when
it is correctable for a complementary channel. This result is shown to hold
even for approximate notions of private and correctable defined in terms of the
diamond norm for superoperators.

be defined as its distance to the set of all separable two-mode Gaussian
states. The principal property that enables us to evaluate both Bures distance
and relative entropy between symmetric two-mode Gaussian states is the
diagonalization of their covariance matrices under the same beam-splitter
transformation. The multiplicativity property of the Uhlmann fidelity and the
additivity of the relative entropy allow one to finally deal with a single-mode
optimization problem in both cases. We find that only the Bures-distance
Gaussian entanglement is consistent with the exact entanglement of formation.

known to have a caustic along the corresponding classical closed phase space

semiclassical chord function, also has a caustic along the conjugate curve
defined as the locus of diameters, i.e. the maximal chords of the original
curve. If the latter is convex, so is its conjugate, resulting in a simple fold
caustic. The uniform approximation through this caustic, that is here derived,
describes the transition undergone by the overlap of the state with its
translation, from an oscillatory regime for small chords, to evanescent
overlaps, rising to a maximum near the caustic. The diameter-caustic for the

demonstrated with electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Extreme
frequency filtering is performed for THz order of broadband PDC light and the
frequency bandwidth of the light is reduced to MHz order. Storage and retrieval
procedures are carried out for the frequency filtered PDC photons. Since the
filtered bandwidth [full width at half-maximum (FWHM) = 9 MHz] is within the
EIT window (FWHM = 12.6 MHz), the flux of the PDC light is successfully stored
and retrieved. The nonclassicality of the retrieved light is confirmed by using
photon counting method, where the classical inequality which is only satisfied
for classical light fields is introduced. Since the PDC photons can be utilized
for producing the single photon state conditionally, storage and retrieval
procedures are also performed for the conditional single photons.
Anti-correlation parameter used for checking the property of single photon

identical, finite dimensional quantum systems. These evolve in discrete time
steps according to a local, shift-invariant unitary evolution. By local we mean
that no instantaneous long-range communication can occur. In order to define
these over a Hilbert space we must restrict to a base of finite, yet unbounded
configurations. We show that QCA always admit a two-layered block
representation, and hence the inverse QCA is again a QCA. This is a striking
result since the property does not hold for classical one-dimensional cellular
automata as defined over such finite configurations. As an example we discuss a
bijective cellular automata which becomes non-local as a QCA, in a rare case of
reversible computation which does not admit a straightforward quantization. We
argue that a whole class of bijective cellular automata should no longer be
considered to be reversible in a physical sense. Note that the same two-layered
block representation result applies also over infinite configurations, as was
previously shown for one-dimensional systems in the more elaborate formalism of
operators algebras [9]. Here the proof is made simpler and self-contained,
moreover we discuss a counterexample QCA in higher dimensions.

$|q_1&gt;$ and $|q_2&gt;$ are arbitrary normalized single qubit states. It is shown

two-level atom which interacts with a single quantized electromagnetic field
mode according to the Jaynes-Cummings model, where the field is initially
prepared in a thermal state. The time evolution of the Bloch vector S(t) seems
to be in complete disorder because of the thermal distribution of the initial
state of the field. Both the norm and the direction of S(t) oscillate hard and
their periods seem infinite. We observe that the trajectory of the time
evolution of S(t) in the two- or three-dimensional space does not form a closed
path. To remove the fast frequency oscillation from the trajectory, we take the
time-average of the Bloch vector S(t). We examine the histogram of
{S_{z}(n\Delta t)|n=0,1,...,N} for small \Delta t and large N. It represents an
absolute value of a derivative of the inverse function of S_{z}(t). (When the
inverse function of y=S_{z}(t) is a multi-valued function, the histogram
represents a summation of the absolute values of its derivatives at points
whose real parts are equal to y on the Riemann surface.) We examine the
dependence of the variance of the histogram on the temperature of the field. We
estimate the lower bound of the entanglement between the atom and the field.

spin measurement, the phase is completely undetermined; after a few

transposition of the EPR (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) argument to macroscopic
physical quantities. The purpose of this article is to discuss this

  wave-function?</title><description>  At present, there are two possible, and equally plausible, explanations for
the physics of quantum measurement. The first explanation, known as the
many-worlds interpretation, does not require any modification of quantum
mechanics, and asserts that at the time of measurement the Universe splits into
many branches, one branch for every possible alternative. The various branches
do not interfere with each other because of decoherence, thus providing a
picture broadly consistent with the observed Universe. The second explanation,
which requires quantum mechanics to be modified from its presently known form,
is that at the time of measurement the wave-function collapses into one of the
possible alternatives. The two explanations are mutually exclusive, and up
until now, no theoretical reasoning has been put forward to choose one
explanation over the other. In this article, we provide an argument which
implies that the collapse interpretation is favored over the many-worlds
interpretation. Our starting point is the assertion (which we justify) that
there ought to exist a reformulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer
to a classical spacetime manifold. The need for such a reformulation implies
that quantum theory becomes non-linear on the Planck mass/energy scale.
Standard linear quantum mechanics is an approximation to this non-linear
theory, valid at energy scales much smaller than the Planck scale. Using ideas
based on noncommutative differential geometry, we develop such a reformulation
and derive a non-linear Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation, which can explain collapse of
the wave-function. We also obtain an expression for the lifetime of a quantum
superposition. We suggest ideas for an experimental test of this model.

  Jaynes-Cummings model</title><description>  In this paper, we examine the effects of the gravitational field on the
dynamical evolution of the cavity-field entropy and the creation of the
Schrodinger-cat state in the Jaynes-Cummings model. We consider a moving
two-level atom interacting with a single mode quantized cavity-field in the
presence of a classical homogeneous gravitational field. Based on an su(2)
algebra, as the dynamical symmetry group of the model, we derive the reduced
density operator of the cavity-field which includes the effects of the atomic
motion and the gravitational field. Also, we obtain the exact solution and the
approximate solution for the system-state vector, and examine the atomic
dynamics. By considering the temporal evolution of the cavity-field entropy as
well as the dynamics of the Q-function of the cavity-field we study the effects
of the gravitational field on the generation of the Schrodinger-cat states of
the cavity-field by using the Q-function, field entropy and approximate
solution for the system-state vector. The results show that the gravitational
field destroys the generation of the Schrodinger-cat state of the cavity-field.

macroscopic superpositions of different quasi-momentum states. We demonstrate
that the generation of such kind of states using slightly non-uniform ring
lattices has several advantages: the energy gap decreases less severely with
the number of particles, the sensitivity to detunings from the critical
rotation frequency is reduced, and the scheme is not limited to commensurate
filling. We show that different quasi-momentum states can be distinguished in
time-of-flight absorption imaging and propose to probe correlations via the
many-body oscillations induced by a sudden change in the rotation frequency.

quantum theory, and that this global evolution $U$ be causal, in accordance

transmitted at a bounded speed, the speed bound being quite naturally that of
one edge of the underlying graph per iteration of $U$. We show that under these

the form of a quantum circuit made up with more elementary operators -- each
acting solely upon neighbouring nodes. We take quantum cellular automata as an

be summarized and the known (not yet decided) contradiction between Einstein
and Bohr will be newly analyzed. The given assumptions have been represented
basically by time-dependent Schroedinger equation, to which some further
assumptions have been added. Some critical comments have been raised against
the given mathematical model structure by Pauli (1933) and by Susskind and
Glogover (1964). They may be removed if only the Schroedinger equation is
conserved and the additional assumptions are abandoned, as shown recently. It
seems to be in contradiction to the numerous declarations that the Copenhagen
model has been approved by experimental results.
  However, in the most of these experiments only the agreement with the mere
Schroedinger equation has been tested. All mentioned assumptions have been
tested practically only in the EPR experiment (measurement of coincidence light
transmission through two polarizers) proposed originally by Einstein (1935).
Also these experimental results have been interpreted as supporting the
Copenhagen alternative, which has not been, however, true. In fact the
microscopic world may be described correspondingly only with the help of the
hidden-variable theory that is represented by the Schroedinger equation without
mentioned additional assumptions, which has the consequence that the earlier
interpretation gap between microscopic and macroscopic worlds has been removed.
The only difference concerns the existence of discrete states. The
possibilities of the human reason of getting to know the nature will be also
shortly discussed in the beginning of this contribution.

integrable Sutherland type many-body models with spin, which are called twisted
spin Sutherland models if the underlying twisted conjugations are built on

using unitary operations. Under this assumption, many nice properties have been
shown about quantum zero knowledge, including the fact that Honest-Verifier
Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (HVQSZK) is equal to Cheating-Verifier
Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge (QSZK) (see [Wat02,Wat06]).
  In this paper, we study what happens when we allow an honest verifier to flip
some coins in addition to using unitary operations. Flipping a coin is a
non-unitary operation but doesn't seem at first to enhance the cheating
possibilities of the verifier since a classical honest verifier can flip coins.
In this setting, we show an unexpected result: any classical Interactive Proof
has an Honest-Verifier Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge proof with coins.
Note that in the classical case, honest verifier SZK is no more powerful than
SZK and hence it is not believed to contain even NP. On the other hand, in the
case of cheating verifiers, we show that Quantum Statistical Zero Knowledge
where the verifier applies any non-unitary operation is equal to Quantum
Zero-Knowledge where the verifier uses only unitaries.
  One can think of our results in two complementary ways. If we would like to
use the honest verifier model as a means to study the general model by taking
advantage of their equivalence, then it is imperative to use the unitary
definition without coins, since with the general one this equivalence is most
probably not true. On the other hand, if we would like to use quantum zero
knowledge protocols in a cryptographic scenario where the honest-but-curious
model is sufficient, then adding the unitary constraint severely decreases the
power of quantum zero knowledge protocols.

four-level double-$\Lambda$-type systems are studied theoretically. We apply
three continous-wave driving fields and a pulsed probe field such that they
form a closed interaction loop. Due to the closed loop and the finite frequency
width of the probe pulses the multiphoton resonance condition cannot be
fulfilled, such that a time-dependent analysis is required. By identifying the
different underlying physical processes we determine the parts of the solution
relevant to calculate the linear and nonlinear response of the system. We find
that the system can exhibit a strong intensity dependent refractive index with
small absorption over a range of several natural linewidths. For a realistic
example we include Doppler and pressure broadening and calculate the nonlinear
selfphase modulation in a gas cell with Sodium vapor and Argon buffer gas. We
find that a selfphase modulation of $\pi$ is achieved after a propagation of
few centimeters through the medium while the absorption in the corresponding
spectral range is small.

objects are special cases of perceptual objects including consequently objects
of a quantum mechanical measurement, the question is to inquire on the limits
of their description in the language of a formal-axiomatical theory. On one
hand, I derive an irreducibility on the level of observables as indecomposable
atoms without any further syntactical content in formal representation and on
the other a transcendence of a continuous substratum self-constituted as a kind
of impredicative synthetic unity on which to define an observational frame and

linearly in time, whereas the interactions between them are pulse-shaped. We
derive a highly accurate analytic approximation by assuming independent
pairwise Landau-Zener transitions occurring instantly at the relevant avoided
crossings, and adiabatic evolution elsewhere. Quantum interferences are
identified, which occur due to different possible evolution paths in Hilbert
space between an initial and a final state. A detailed comparison with
numerical results for Gaussian-shaped pulses demonstrates a remarkable accuracy
of the analytic approximation. We use the analytic results to derive estimates
for the half-width of the excitation profile, and for the parameters required
for creation of a maximally coherent superposition of the three states. These
results are of potential interest in ladder climbing in alkali atoms by chirped
laser pulses, in quantum rotors, in transitions between Zeeman sublevels of a
J=1 level in a magnetic field, and in control of entanglement of a pair of
spin-1/2 particles. The results for the three-state system can be generalized,
without essential difficulties, to higher dimensions.

  transformations</title><description>  The search problem is to find a state satisfying certain properties out of a
given set. Grover's algorithm drives a quantum computer from a prepared initial
state to the target state and solves the problem quadratically faster than a
classical computer. The algorithm uses selective transformations to distinguish
the initial state and target state from other states. It does not succeed
unless the selective transformations are very close to phase-inversions. Here
we show a way to go beyond this limitation. An important application lies in
quantum error-correction, where the errors can cause the selective
transformations to deviate from phase-inversions. The algorithms presented here
are robust to errors as long as the errors are reproducible and reversible.
This particular class of systematic errors arise often from imperfections in
apparatus setup. Hence our algorithms offer a significant flexibility in the
physical implementation of quantum search.

  domains</title><description>  A Markov approximation in open quantum dynamics can give unphysical results
when a map acts on a state that is not in its domain. This is examined here in
a simple example, an open quantum dynamics for one qubit in a system of two
interacting qubits, for which the map domains have been described quite
completely. A time interval is split into two parts and the map from the exact
dynamics for the entire interval is replaced by the conjunction of that same
map for both parts. If there is any correlation between the two qubits,
unphysical results can appear as soon as the map conjunction is used, even for
infinitesimal times. If the map is repeated an unlimited number of times, every
state is at risk of being taken outside the bounds of physical meaning.
Treatment by slippage of initial conditions is discussed.

Harper map belongs to a class of Hamiltonian systems (non-twist maps) which

studied. The position of one of the scatterers is the perturbation parameter.
Such perturbations can be considered as {\em local} since wave functions are
influenced only locally, in contrast to, e. g., the situation where the
fidelity decay is caused by the shift of one billiard wall. Using the
random-plane-wave conjecture, an analytic expression for the fidelity decay due

the fidelity decay on the shift distance. The only free parameter has been

Shiekh has discussed an experimental set-up which, in
his opinion, should make possible faster-than-light communication using the
collapse of the quantum wave function. Contrary to the many proposals which
have been presented in the past, he does not resort to an entangled state of
two systems but he works with a single particle in a superposition of two
states - corresponding to its propagation in opposite directions - one of which
goes through an appropriate interferometer. The possibility for an observer
near the interferometer to introduce or not, at his free will, a phase shifter
along one of the paths should allow to change instantaneously the probability
of finding the particle in the far-away region corresponding to the other state
of the superposition and, correspondingly, to change the intensity of a beam of
particles reaching a distant observer. In this paper we show a flaw in the
argument: once more, as it has been proved in full generality a long time ago,
the process of wave packet reduction cannot be used for superluminal

  hysteresis curves</title><description>  We consider a strongly driven two-level (spin) system, with a periodic
external field that induces a sequence of avoided level crossings. The spin
system interacts with a bosonic reservoir which leads to decoherence. A
Markovian dynamical equation is introduced without relying on the rotating wave
approximation in the system-external field interaction. We show that the time
evolution of the two-level system is directed towards an incoherent sum of
periodic Floquet states regardless of the initial state and even the type of
the coupling to the environment. Analyzing the time scale of approaching these
time-dependent pointer states, information can be deduced concerning the nature
and strength of the system-environment coupling. The inversion as a function of
the external field is usually multi-valued, and the form of these hysteresis
curves is qualitatively different for low and high temperatures. For moderate
temperatures we found that the series of Landau-Zener-St\&quot;{u}ckelberg-type
transitions still can be used for state preparation, regardless of the
decoherence rate. Possible applications include quantum information processing
and molecular nanomagnets.

Decoherence, measured in terms of purity, is calculated in linear response
approximation, making use of the spectator configuration. The environment and
its interaction with the qubits are modelled by random matrices. For two
qubits, numerical studies reveal a simple one to one correspondence between its
decoherence and its internal entanglement decay. Using this relation we are
able to give a formula for concurrence decay. For large environments the
evolution induces a unital channel in the two qubits, providing a partial
explanation for the relation above. Using a kicked Ising spin network, we study
the exact evolution of two non-interacting qubits in the presence of a spin
bath. We find that the entanglement (as measured by concurrence) of the two
qubits has a close relation to the purity of the pair, and closely follows an
analytic relation derived for Werner states. As a collateral result we find
that an integrable environment causes quadratic decay of concurrence as well as
of purity, while a chaotic environment causes linear decay. Both quantities
display recurrences in some integrable environments. Good agreement with the
results found using random matrix theory is obtained. Finally, we analyze
decoherence of a quantum register in the absence of non-local operations. The
problem is solved in terms of a sum rule which implies linear scaling in the
number of qubits. Each term involves a single qubit and its entanglement with
the remaining ones. Two conditions are essential: decoherence must be small and
the coupling of different qubits must be uncorrelated in the interaction
picture. We apply the result to the random matrix model, and illustrate its
reach considering a GHZ state coupled to a spin bath.

  theory and quantum gravity</title><description>  We show that there are significant conceptual differences between QM and QFT
which make it difficult to view the latter as just a relativistic extension of
the principles of QM. At the root of this is a fundamental distinction between
Born-localization in QM (which in the relativistic context changes its name to
Newton-Wigner localization) and modular localization which is the localization
underlying QFT, after one liberates it from its standard presentation in terms
of field coordinates. The first comes with a probability notion and projection
operators, whereas the latter describes causal propagation in QFT and leads to
thermal aspects of locally reduced finite energy states. The Born-Newton-Wigner
localization in QFT is only applicable asymptotically and the covariant
correlation between asymptotic in and out localization projectors is the basis
of the existence of an invariant scattering matrix. Taking these significant
differences serious has not only repercussions for the philosophy of science,
but also leads to a new structural properties as a consequence of vacuum
polarization: the area law for localization entropy near the the causal
localization horizon and a more realistic cutoff independent setting for the
cosmological vacuum energy density which is compatible with local covariance.

  gases with attractive 1/r-interaction</title><description>  The extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation for the Bose-Einstein condensation of
gases with attractive 1/r-interaction has a second solution which is born
together with the ground state in a tangent bifurcation. At the bifurcation
point both states coalesce, i.e., the energies and the wave functions are
identical. We investigate the bifurcation point in the context of exceptional
points, a phenomenon known for linear non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. We point out
that the mean field energy, the chemical potential, and the wave functions show
the same behavior as an exceptional point in a linear, non-symmetric system.
The analysis of the analytically continued Gross-Pitaevskii equation reveals
complex waves at negative scattering lengths below the tangent bifurcation.
These solutions are interpreted as a decay of the condensate caused by an
absorbing potential.

entangled. This entanglement process is constrained by the symmetries of the
scattering system and the boundary conditions on the incoming state. Applying
these constraints, three different mechanisms of entanglement can be
identified: the superposition of reflected and transmitted modes, momentum
correlations of the reflected mode due to inversion of the relative momentum,
and momentum correlations in the transmitted and reflected modes due to
dependence of the scattering amplitude on the relative momentum. We consider
three standard potentials, the hard core, Dirac delta, and double Dirac delta,
and show that the relative importance of these mechanisms depends on the
interaction and on the properties of the incoming wave function. We find that
even when the momenta distributions of the incoming articles are sharply
peaked, entanglement due to the momentum correlations generated by reflection

classical linear codes and the properties of stabilizer codes have been
carefully studied in the literature. In this paper, a new but simple
construction of stabilizer codes is proposed based on syndrome assignment by
classical parity-check matrices. This method reduces the construction of
quantum stabilizer codes to the construction of classical parity-check matrices
that satisfy a specific commutative condition. The quantum stabilizer codes
from this construction have a larger set of correctable error operators than
expected. Its (asymptotic) coding efficiency is comparable to that of CSS
codes. A class of quantum Reed-Muller codes is constructed, which have a larger
set of correctable error operators than that of the quantum Reed-Muller codes
developed previously in the literature. Quantum stabilizer codes inspired by
classical quadratic residue codes are also constructed and some of which are
optimal in terms of their coding parameters.

sufficiently weak coupling strength (or with arbitrarily finite coupling
strength for a linear system) at the same temperature. In the quantum domain
this may be expected to change due to system-bath entanglement. Here we show
analytically that the work needed to couple a single linear oscillator with
finite strength to a bath cannot be less than the work obtainable from the
oscillator when it decouples from the bath. Therefore, the quantum second law
holds for an arbitrary temperature. This is a generalization of the previous
results for zero temperature [1,2]; in the high temperature limit we recover
the classical behavior.

considered. The mean probability distribution of a Markov chain on a hypercube
is known to mix to a uniform distribution in time O(n log n). We show that the
mean probability distribution of a discrete-time quantum walk on a hypercube
mixes to a (generally non-uniform) distribution pi(x) in time O(n) and the
stationary distribution is determined by the initial state of the walk. An
explicit expression for pi(x) is derived for the particular case of a symmetric
walk. These results are consistent with those obtained previously for a
continuous-time quantum walk. The effect of decoherence due to randomly
breaking links between connected sites in the hypercube is also considered. We
find that the probability distribution mixes to the uniform distribution as
expected. However, the mixing time has a minimum at a critical decoherence rate
$p \approx 0.1$. A similar effect was previously reported for the QW on the
N-cycle with decoherence from repeated measurements of position. A controlled
amount of decoherence helps to obtain--and preserve--a uniform distribution
over the $2^n$ sites of the hypercube in the shortest possible time.

potential. Since its introduction by Hohenberg, Kohn, and Sham, Density
Functional Theory (DFT) has become the most widely used and successful method
for simulating systems of interacting electrons, making their original work one
of the most cited in physics. In this letter, we show that the field of
computational complexity imposes fundamental limitations on DFT, as an
efficient description of the associated universal functional would allow to
solve any problem in the class QMA (the quantum version of NP) and thus
particularly any problem in NP in polynomial time. This follows from the fact
that finding the ground state energy of the Hubbard model in an external
magnetic field is a hard problem even for a quantum computer, while given the
universal functional it can be computed efficiently using DFT. This provides a
clear illustration how the field of quantum computing is useful even if quantum
computers would never be built.

induce a fluctuation term in the counting of energy levels. We next quantize
the xp Hamiltonian, adding an interaction term that depends on two wave

the symmetry of the model under the exchange of position and momenta which is
related to the duality symmetry of the zeta function. The boundary wave

phase fluctuations in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer in installed fibers with

We show that two harmonic oscillators in arbitrary Gaussian state can be

universal and phase-covariant cloning) can be decorrelated only at the expense
of a complete erasure of information about the copied state. More generally, in
finite dimension, cloning without correlations is impossible for continuous

continuous problems. 1. Are quantum computers more powerful than classical
computers for important scientific problems? How much more powerful? 2. Many
important scientific and engineering problems have continuous formulations. To
answer the first question we must know the classical computational complexity
of the problem. Knowing the classical complexity of a continuous problem we
obtain the quantum computation speedup if we know the quantum complexity. If we
know an upper bound on the quantum complexity through the cost of a particular
quantum algorithm then we can obtain a lower bound on the quantum speedup.

high-dimensional integration, path integration, Feynman path integration, the
smallest eigenvalue of a differential equation, approximation, partial

  reflections</title><description>  Population trapping occurs when a particular quantum-state superposition is
immune to action by a specific interaction, such as the well-known dark state
in a three-state lambda system. We here show that in a three-state loop
linkage, a Hilbert-space Householder reflection breaks the loop and presents
the linkage as a single chain. With certain conditions on the interaction
parameters, this chain can break into a simple two-state system and an
additional spectator state. Alternatively, a two-photon resonance condition in
this Householder-basis chain can be enforced, which heralds the existence of
another spectator state. These spectator states generalize the usual dark state
to include contributions from all three bare basis states and disclose hidden
population trapping effects, and hence hidden constants of motion. Insofar as a
spectator state simplifies the overall dynamics, its existence facilitates the
derivation of analytic solutions and the design of recipes for quantum state
engineering in the loop system. Moreover, it is shown that a suitable sequence
of Householder transformations can cast an arbitrary N-dimensional hermitian
Hamiltonian into a tridiagonal form. The implication is that a general N-state
system, with arbitrary linkage patterns where each state connects to any other
state, can be reduced to an equivalent chainwise-connected system, with
nearest-neighbor interactions only, with ensuing possibilities for discovering
hidden multidimensional spectator states and constants of motion.

which they claimed that the whole formalism of quantum mechanics together with
what they called &quot;Reality Criterion&quot; imply that quantum mechanics cannot be
complete. That is, there must exist some elements of reality that are not
described by quantum mechanics. There must be, they concluded, a more complete
description of physical reality behind quantum mechanics. There must be a
state, a hidden variable, characterizing the state of affairs in the world in
more details than the quantum mechanical state, something that also reflects
the missing elements of reality.
  Under some further but quite plausible assumptions, this conclusion implies
that in some spin-correlation experiments the measured quantum mechanical
probabilities should satisfy particular inequalities (Bell-type inequalities).
The paradox consists in the fact that quantum probabilities do not satisfy
these inequalities. And this paradoxical fact has been confirmed by several
laboratory experiments in the last three decades. The problem is still open and
hotly debated among both physicists and philosophers. It has motivated a wide
range of research from the most fundamental quantum mechanical experiments
through foundations of probability theory to the theory of stochastic causality
as well as the metaphysics of free will.

probability strictly greater than 1/2. We show that, just as in the
communication complexity model, the unbounded error quantum query complexity is
exactly half of its classical counterpart for any (partial or total) Boolean

query algorithms into communication protocols by Buhrman-Cleve-Wigderson
[STOC'98] is optimal even in the unbounded error setting.
  We also study a setting related to the unbounded error model, called the
weakly unbounded error setting, where the cost of a query algorithm is given by
q+log(1/2(p-1/2)), where q is the number of queries made and p&gt;1/2 is the
success probability of the algorithm. In contrast to the case of communication
complexity, we show a tight Theta(log n) separation between quantum and
classical query complexity in the weakly unbounded error setting for a partial
Boolean function. We also show the asymptotic equivalence between them for some
well-studied total Boolean functions.

  Bose-Einstein condensate</title><description>  Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is an important tool for
controlling light propagation and nonlinear wave mixing in atomic gases with
potential applications ranging from quantum computing to table top tests of
general relativity. Here we consider EIT in an atomic Bose-Einstein Condensate
(BEC) trapped in a double well potential. A weak probe laser propagates through
one of the wells and interacts with atoms in a three-level $\Lambda$
configuration. The well through which the probe propagates is dressed by a
strong control laser with Rabi frequency $\Omega_{\mu}$, as in standard EIT
systems. Tunneling between the wells at the frequency $g$ provides a coherent
coupling between identical electronic states in the two wells, which leads to
the formation of inter-well dressed states. The tunneling in conjunction with
the macroscopic interwell coherence of the BEC wave function, results in the
formation of two ultra-narrow absorption resonances for the probe field that
are inside of the ordinary EIT transparency window. We show that these new
resonances can be interpreted in terms of the inter-well dressed states and the
formation of a novel type of dark state involving the control laser and the
inter-well tunneling. To either side of these ultra-narrow resonances there is
normal dispersion with very large slope controlled by $g$. For realistic values
of $g$, the large slope of this dispersion yields group velocities for the
probe field that are two orders of magnitude slower than standard EIT systems.
We discuss prospects for observing these ultra-narrow resonances and the
corresponding regions of high dispersion experimentally.

translational-invariant critical spin chains is investigated. At criticality,
the accuracy with which they describe ground state properties of a system is
limited by the size $\chi$ of the matrices that form the approximation. This
limitation is quantified in terms of the scaling of the half-chain entanglement
entropy. In the case of the quantum Ising model, we find $S \sim {1/6}\log
\chi$ with high precision. This result can be understood as the emergence of an
effective finite correlation length $\xi_\chi$ ruling of all the scaling
properties in the system. We produce five extra pieces of evidence for this
finite-$\chi$ scaling, namely, the scaling of the correlation length, the
scaling of magnetization, the shift of the critical point, and the scaling of
the entanglement entropy for a finite block of spins. All our computations are
consistent with a scaling relation of the form $\xi_\chi\sim \chi^{\kappa}$,
with $\kappa=2$ for the Ising model. In the case of the Heisenberg model, we
find similar results with the value $\kappa\sim 1.37$. We also show how
finite-$\chi$ scaling allow to extract critical exponents. These results are

2 saturating the quantum Singleton bound for arbitrarily large $n$ and $D$ are
constructed using simple graphs, except when $n$ is odd and $D$ is even.
Computer searches have produced a number of codes with distances 3 and 4, some
previously known and some new. The concept of a stabilizer is extended to
general $D$, and shown to provide a dual representation of an additive graph

interpolation procedure, Boyer has shown that the existence of a zero-point
energy leads to the Planck spectrum. Here we avoid the interpolation by adding
a statistical argument to arrive at Planck's law as an inescapable result of
the presence of the zero-point energy. No explicit quantum argument is
introduced along the derivations. We disclose the connection of our results
with the original analysis of Planck and Einstein, which led to the notion of
the quantized radiation field. We then inquire into the discrete or continuous
behaviour of the energy and pinpoint the discontinuities. Finally, to open the
door to the description of the zero-point fluctuations, we briefly discuss the
statistical (in contrast to the purely thermodynamic) description of the
oscillator, which accounts for both thermal and temperature-independent
contributions to the energy dispersion.

  gate complexity for fault-tolerant quantum computation</title><description>  Teleportation is a crucial element in fault-tolerant quantum computation and
a complete understanding of its capacity is very important for the practical
implementation of optimal fault-tolerant architectures. It is known that
stabilizer codes support a natural set of gates that can be more easily
implemented by teleportation than any other gates. These gates belong to the so
called $\mathcal{C}_k$ hierarchy introduced by Gottesman and Chuang (Nature
\textbf{402}, 390). Moreover, a subset of $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates, called
semi-Clifford operations, can be implemented by an even simpler architecture
than the traditional teleportation setup (Phys. Rev. \textbf{A62}, 052316).
However, the precise set of gates in $\mathcal{C}_k$ remains unknown, even for
a fixed number of qubits $n$, which prevents us from knowing exactly what
teleportation is capable of. In this paper we study the structure of
$\mathcal{C}_k$ in terms of semi-Clifford operations, which send by conjugation
at least one maximal abelian subgroup of the $n$-qubit Pauli group into another
one. We show that for $n=1,2$, all the $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates are semi-Clifford,
which is also true for $\{n=3,k=3\}$. However, this is no longer true for
$\{n&gt;2,k&gt;3\}$. To measure the capability of this teleportation primitive, we
introduce a quantity called `teleportation depth', which characterizes how many
teleportation steps are necessary, on average, to implement a given gate. We
calculate upper bounds for teleportation depth by decomposing gates into both
semi-Clifford $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates and those $\mathcal{C}_k$ gates beyond
semi-Clifford operations, and compare their efficiency.

  Multi-Prover Interactive Proof Systems</title><description>  A central question in quantum information theory and computational complexity
is how powerful nonlocal strategies are in cooperative games with imperfect
information, such as multi-prover interactive proof systems. This paper
develops a new method for proving limits of nonlocal strategies that make use
of prior entanglement among players (or, provers, in the terminology of
multi-prover interactive proofs). Instead of proving the limits for usual
isolated provers who initially share entanglement, this paper proves the limits
for &quot;commuting-operator provers&quot;, who share private space, but can apply only
such operators that are commutative with any operator applied by other provers.
Commuting-operator provers are at least as powerful as usual isolated but
prior-entangled provers, and thus, limits for commuting-operator provers
immediately give limits for usual entangled provers. Using this method, we
obtain an n-party generalization of the Tsirelson bound for the Clauser-Horne-
Shimony-Holt inequality for every n. Our bounds are tight in the sense that, in
every n-party case, the equality is achievable by a usual nonlocal strategy
with prior entanglement. We also apply our method to a 3-prover 1-round binary
interactive proof for NEXP. Combined with the technique developed by Kempe,
Kobayashi, Matsumoto, Toner and Vidick to analyze the soundness of the proof
system, it is proved to be NP-hard to distinguish whether the entangled value
of a 3-prover 1-round binary-answer game is equal to 1 or at most 1-1/p(n) for
some polynomial p, where n is the number of questions. This is in contrast to
the 2-prover 1-round binary-answer case, where the corresponding problem is
efficiently decidable. Alternatively, NEXP has a 3-prover 1-round binary
interactive proof system with perfect completeness and soundness 1-2^{-poly}.

particle spectrum is generally anisotropic and contains two degenerate minima
at finite momenta. At low temperatures, the many-body system condenses into
these minima generating a new type of entangled Bose-Einstein condensate. We
show that in the presence of weak density-density interactions the many-body

many-body wave function describes a condensate of ``left-'' and
``right-moving'' bosons. By fine-tuning the parameters of the laser field, one

on-chip microwave resonators are simultaneously coupled to one superconducting
qubit. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the qubit can function as a
quantum switch between the two resonators, which are assumed to be originally
independent. In this three-circuit network, the qubit mediates a geometric
second-order circuit interaction between the otherwise decoupled resonators. In
the dispersive regime, it also gives rise to a dynamic second-order
perturbative interaction. The geometric and dynamic coupling strengths can be
tuned to be equal, thus permitting to switch on and off the interaction between
the two resonators via a qubit population inversion or a shifting of the qubit
operation point. We also show that our quantum switch represents a flexible
architecture for the manipulation and generation of nonclassical microwave
field states as well as the creation of controlled multipartite entanglement in
circuit QED. In addition, we clarify the role played by the geometric
interaction, which constitutes a fundamental property characteristic of
superconducting quantum circuits without counterpart in quantum-optical
systems. We develop a detailed theory of the geometric second-order coupling by
means of circuit transformations for superconducting charge and flux qubits.
Furthermore, we show the robustness of the quantum switch operation with
respect to decoherence mechanisms. Finally, we propose a realistic design for a
two-resonator circuit QED setup based on a flux qubit and estimate all the
related parameters. In this manner, we show that this setup can be used to
implement a superconducting quantum switch with available technology.

solving problems related to satisfiability. Our bound applies to MajSAT and
MajMajSAT, which are complete problems for the first and second levels of the
counting hierarchy, respectively. We prove that for every real d and every
positive real epsilon there exists a real c&gt;1 such that either: MajMajSAT does
not have a quantum algorithm with bounded two-sided error that runs in time
n^c, or MajSAT does not have a quantum algorithm with bounded two-sided error
that runs in time n^d and space n^{1-\epsilon}. In particular, MajMajSAT cannot
be solved by a quantum algorithm with bounded two-sided error running in time
n^{1+o(1)} and space n^{1-\epsilon} for any epsilon&gt;0. The key technical
novelty is a time- and space-efficient simulation of quantum computations with
intermediate measurements by probabilistic machines with unbounded error. We
also develop a model that is particularly suitable for the study of general
quantum computations with simultaneous time and space bounds. However, our
arguments hold for any reasonable uniform model of quantum computation.

of local causality and does not rely on concepts of quantum and probability
theory. We consider experiments in which the averages correspond to those of a
singlet and product state of a system of two $S=1/2$ particles. The data is
analyzed according to the experimental procedure, employing a time window to
identify pairs. We study how the time window and the passage time of the
photons, which depends on the relative angle between their polarization and the
polarizer's direction, influences the correlations, demonstrating that the
properties of the optical elements in the observation stations affect the
correlations although the stations are separated spatially and temporarily. We

oscillator interacting with a bath of independent two-level systems. This
hitherto virtually unexplored model plays a fundamental role as one of the four
&quot;canonical&quot; system-environment models for decoherence and dissipation. To
investigate the influence of further couplings of the environmental spins to a
dissipative bath, we also derive the master equation for a harmonic oscillator
interacting with a single spin coupled to a bosonic bath. Our models are
experimentally motivated by quantum-electromechanical systems and micron-scale
ion traps. Decoherence and dissipation rates are found to exhibit temperature
dependencies significantly different from those in quantum Brownian motion. In
particular, the systematic dissipation rate for the central oscillator
decreases with increasing temperature and goes to zero at zero temperature, but
there also exists a temperature-independent momentum-diffusion (heating) rate.

which exhibit fractional statistics ranging continuously from bosonic to

anyons has never been observed in nature directly. Here we report the
demonstration of fractional statistics of anyons by simulation of the first

four-body interactions of the lattice-spin model into two-body interactions of
an Ising spin chain in molecules. It can thus efficiently prepare and operate
the ground state and excitations of the model Hamiltonian. This quantum system

biphoton path-length difference and the biphoton path-asymmetry- length
difference--which we construct using the six different length parameters that a
general two-photon interference experiment involves. We perform an experiment
in which the effects of the variations of these two parameters can be
independently controlled and studied. In our experimental setup, which does not
involve mixing of signal and idler photons at a beam splitter, we further
report observations of Hong-Ou-Mandel- (HOM-)like effects both in coincidence

two-photon coherence changes as a function of the biphoton path-

decoding algorithm, and study their performances numerically on a
depolarization channel. Our construction offers several advantages over quantum
LDPC codes. First, the Tanner graph used for decoding is free of 4-cycles that
deteriorate the performances of iterative decoding. Secondly, the iterative
decoder makes explicit use of the code's degeneracy. Finally, there is complete
freedom in the code design in terms of length, rate, memory size, and
interleaver choice.
  We define a quantum analogue of a state diagram that provides an efficient
way to verify the properties of a quantum convolutional code, and in particular
its recursiveness and the presence of catastrophic error propagation. We prove
that all recursive quantum convolutional encoder have catastrophic error
propagation. In our constructions, the convolutional codes have thus been
chosen to be non-catastrophic and non-recursive. While the resulting families
of turbo-codes have bounded minimum distance, from a pragmatic point of view
the effective minimum distances of the codes that we have simulated are large
enough not to degrade the iterative decoding performance up to reasonable word
error rates and block sizes. With well chosen constituent convolutional codes,
we observe an important reduction of the word error rate as the code length
increases.

  multiparticle environments</title><description>  This work studies the feasibility of optimal control of high-fidelity quantum
gates in a model of interacting two-level particles. One particle (the qubit)
serves as the quantum information processor, whose evolution is controlled by a
time-dependent external field. The other particles are not directly controlled
and serve as an effective environment, coupling to which is the source of
decoherence. The control objective is to generate target one-qubit gates in the
presence of strong environmentally-induced decoherence and under physically
motivated restrictions on the control field. It is found that interactions
among the environmental particles have a negligible effect on the gate fidelity
and require no additional adjustment of the control field. Another interesting
result is that optimally controlled quantum gates are remarkably robust to
random variations in qubit-environment and inter-environment coupling
strengths. These findings demonstrate the utility of optimal control for
management of quantum-information systems in a very precise and specific
manner, especially when the dynamics complexity is exacerbated by inherently
uncertain environmental coupling.

ensemble we predict an oscillation threshold for optical Raman sideband lasing
concurrent with coherent matter-wave amplification. Above this oscillation
threshold photons and atoms in the lowest band are dominantly created pairwise

  Quantum States</title><description>  QMA (Quantum Merlin-Arthur) is the quantum analogue of the class NP. There
are a few QMA-complete problems, most notably the ``Local Hamiltonian'' problem
introduced by Kitaev. In this dissertation we show some new QMA-complete
problems.
  The first one is ``Consistency of Local Density Matrices'': given several
density matrices describing different (constant-size) subsets of an n-qubit
system, decide whether these are consistent with a single global state. This
problem was first suggested by Aharonov. We show that it is QMA-complete, via
an oracle reduction from Local Hamiltonian. This uses algorithms for convex
optimization with a membership oracle, due to Yudin and Nemirovskii.
  Next we show that two problems from quantum chemistry, ``Fermionic Local
Hamiltonian'' and ``N-representability,'' are QMA-complete. These problems
arise in calculating the ground state energies of molecular systems.
N-representability is a key component in recently developed numerical methods
using the contracted Schrodinger equation. Although these problems have been
studied since the 1960's, it is only recently that the theory of quantum
computation has allowed us to properly characterize their complexity.
  Finally, we study some special cases of the Consistency problem, pertaining
to 1-dimensional and ``stoquastic'' systems. We also give an alternative proof
of a result due to Jaynes: whenever local density matrices are consistent, they
are consistent with a Gibbs state.

loop enclosing a Josephson weak link. These devices are currently strong
candidates for many applications in quantum technologies. The weak link brings
with it a non-linearity such that semi-classical models of this system can
exhibit chaotic dynamics. For many similar systems an application of the
correspondence principle together with the inclusion of environmental degrees
of freedom through a quantum trajectories approach can be used to effectively
recover classical dynamics. Here we show (i) that the standard expression of
the correspondence principle is incompatible with the ring Hamiltonian and we
present a more pragmatic and general expression which finds application here
and (ii) that practical limitations to circuit parameters of the SQUID ring
prevent arbitrarily accurate recovery of classical chaotic dynamics.

optimised complex multi-qubit instruction sets thus paves the way to fight
decoherence for realistic settings.
  Compiling a quantum module into the machine code for steering a concrete
quantum hardware device lends itself to be tackled by means of optimal quantum
control. To this end, there are two opposite approaches: (i) one may use a
decomposition into the restricted instruction set (RISC) of universal one- and
two-qubit gates, which in turn have prefabricated translations into the machine
code or (ii) one may prefer to generate the entire target module directly by a
complex instruction set (CISC) of available controls. Here we advocate direct
compilation up to the limit of system size a classical high-performance
parallel computer cluster can reasonably handle. For going beyond these limits,
i.e. for large systems we propose a combined way, namely (iii) to make
recursive use of medium-sized building blocks generated by optimal control in
the sense of a quantum CISC compiler.
  The advantage of the method over standard RISC compilations into one- and
two-qubit universal gates is explored on the parallel cluster HLRB-II (with a
total LINPACK performance of 63.3 TFlops/s) for the quantum Fourier transform,
the indirect SWAP gate as well as for multiply-controlled CNOT gates.
Implications for upper limits to time complexities are also derived.

  Nucleation and Lattice Formation</title><description>  We develop a stochastic Gross-Pitaveskii theory suitable for the study of
Bose-Einstein condensation in a {\em rotating} dilute Bose gas. The theory is
used to model the dynamical and equilibrium properties of a rapidly rotating
Bose gas quenched through the critical point for condensation, as in the
experiment of Haljan et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 87, 21043 (2001)]. In contrast
to stirring a vortex-free condensate, where topological constraints require
that vortices enter from the edge of the condensate, we find that phase defects
in the initial non-condensed cloud are trapped en masse in the emerging
condensate. Bose-stimulated condensate growth proceeds into a disordered vortex
configuration. At sufficiently low temperature the vortices then order into a
regular Abrikosov lattice in thermal equilibrium with the rotating cloud. We
calculate the effect of thermal fluctuations on vortex ordering in the final
gas at different temperatures, and find that the BEC transition is accompanied
by lattice melting associated with diminishing long range correlations between
vortices across the system.

potential for developing novel superconducting devices which may be operated in
a wide range of regimes, at a level of precision previously not available.
Unlike traditional, solid-state superconducting devices, the cold-atom systems
allow the fast switching on of the BCS phase, and the observation of
non-equilibrium, coherent oscillations of the order parameter. The integrable
and non-linear nature of the equations of motions makes this operating regime
particularly rich in potential applications, such as quantum modulation and
encoding, or nonlinear mixing of quantum coherent oscillations, to name only
two. From a mathematical point of view, such systems can be described using the
Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation, or more generally, by the matrix
Kadomtsev-Petviashvilii integrable hierarchy. This identification is
particularly useful, since it allows a direct application of the known
non-linear phenomena described by particular solutions of these equations.
Other important features of this formulation, such as the relation to the spin
Calogero-Sutherland model, also have relevant physical interpretations. In this
work, a complete description of these relationships is presented, along with
their potential practical consequences.

entanglement, an intriguing aspect of quantum mechanics where parts of a
composite system can exhibit correlations stronger than any classical
counterpart. In particular, scalable quantum networks require capabilities to
create, store, and distribute entanglement among distant matter nodes via
photonic channels. Atomic ensembles can play the role of such nodes. So far, in
the photon counting regime, heralded entanglement between atomic ensembles has
been successfully demonstrated via probabilistic protocols. However, an
inherent drawback of this approach is the compromise between the amount of
entanglement and its preparation probability, leading intrinsically to low
count rate for high entanglement. Here we report a protocol where entanglement
between two atomic ensembles is created by coherent mapping of an entangled
state of light. By splitting a single-photon and subsequent state transfer, we
separate the generation of entanglement and its storage. After a programmable
delay, the stored entanglement is mapped back into photonic modes with overall
efficiency of 17 %. Improvements of single-photon sources together with our
protocol will enable &quot;on demand&quot; entanglement of atomic ensembles, a powerful
resource for quantum networking.

  Concept</title><description>  Extended Everett's Concept (EEC) recently developed by the author to explain
the phenomenon of consciousness is considered. A mathematical model is proposed
for the principal feature of consciousness assumed in EEC, namely its ability
(in the state of sleep, trance or meditation, when the explicit consciousness
is disabled) to obtain information from all alternative classical realities
(Everett's worlds) and select the favorable realities. To represent this
ability, a mathematical operation called postcorrection is introduced, which
corrects the present state to guarantee certain characteristics of the future
state. Evolution of living matter is thus determined by goals (first of all by
the goal of survival) as well as by causes. The resulting theory, in a way
symmetrical in time direction, follows from a sort of antropic principle.
Possible criteria for postcorrection and corresponding phenomena in the sphere
of life are classified. Both individual and collective criteria of survival are
considered as well as the criteria providing certain quality of life and those
which are irrelevant to the life quality. The phenomena of free will and direct
sighting of truth (e.g. scientific insight) are explained in these terms. The
problem of artificial intellect and the role of brain look differently in the
framework of this theory. Automats may perform intellectual operations, but not
postcorrection, therefore artificial intellect but not an artificial life can
be created. The brain serves as an interface between the body and
consciousness, but the most profound level of consciousness is not a function
of brain.

of strong coupling, a semitransparent boundary becomes a Dirichlet one.) After
applying the method to rederive the Casimir force between two semitransparent

expressions for the Casimir energies between disjoint parallel semitransparent
cylinders and between disjoint semitransparent spheres. Simplifications occur
for weak and strong coupling. In particular, after performing a power series
expansion in the ratio of the radii of the objects to the separation between
them, we are able to sum the weak-coupling expansions exactly to obtain
explicit closed forms for the Casimir interaction energy. The same can be done
for the interaction of a weak-coupling sphere or cylinder with a Dirichlet
plane. We show that the proximity force approximation (PFA), which becomes the

that the players can indeed escape from the classical outcome of the game
because of non-factorizable joint probabilities. This result for three-player
PD contrasts strikingly with our earlier result for two-player PD for which
even non-factorizable joint probabilities are not found to be helpful to escape
from the classical outcome of the game.

  Uncertainty States of the Photon Field</title><description>  The exact analytic solutions of the energy eigenvalue equation of the system
consisting of a free electron and one mode of the quantized radiation field are
used for studying the physical meaning of a class of number-phase minimum
uncertainty states. The states of the mode which minimize the uncertainty
product of the photon number and the Susskind and Glogower (1964) cosine
operator have been obtained by Jackiw (1968). However, these states have so far
been remained mere mathematical constructions without any physical
significance. It is proved that the most fundamental interaction in quantum
electrodynamics - namely the interaction of a free electron with a mode of the
quantized radiation field - leads quite naturally to the generation of the
mentioned minimum uncertainty states. It is shown that from the entangled
photon-electron states developing from a highly excited number state, due to
the interaction with a Gaussian electronic wave packet, the minimum uncertainty
states of Jackiw's type can be constructed. In the electron's coordinate
representation the physical meaning of the expansion coefficients of these
states are the joint probability amplitudes of simultaneous detection of an
electron and of a definite number of photons. The joint occupation
probabilities in these states preserve their functional form as time elapses,
but they vary from point to point in space-time, depending on the location of
the detected electron. An analysis of the entanglement entropies derived from
the photon number distribution and from the electron's density operator is
given.

pure quantum states of $N$ elementary subsystems, they are defined as the
distances from the sets of $K$-separable states ($K=2,...,N$). The entire set
of generalized geometric measures provides a quantification and hierarchical
ordering of the different bipartite and multipartite components of the global
geometric entanglement, and allows to discriminate among the different
contributions. The extended measures are applied to the study of entanglement
in different classes of $N$-qubit pure states. These classes include $W$ and
$GHZ$ states, and their symmetric superpositions; symmetric multi-magnon
states; cluster states; and, finally, asymmetric generalized $W$-like
superposition states. We discuss in detail a general method for the explicit
evaluation of the multipartite components of geometric entanglement, and we
show that the entire set of geometric measures establishes an ordering among
the different types of bipartite and multipartite entanglement. In particular,
it determines a consistent hierarchy between $GHZ$ and $W$ states, clarifying
the original result of Wei and Goldbart that $W$ states possess a larger global
entanglement than $GHZ$ states. Furthermore, we show that all multipartite
components of geometric entanglement in symmetric states obey a property of
self-similarity and scale invariance with the total number of qubits and the
number of qubits per party.

  In this paper, a new class of quantum LDPC codes based on lines and points of

Also, the column and row weights, and bounds on the minimum distance of these

  semi-transparent mirror</title><description>  Creation of scalar massless particles in two-dimensional Minkowski
space-time--as predicted by the dynamical Casimir effect--is studied for the
case of a semitransparent mirror initially at rest, then accelerating for some
finite time, along a trajectory that simulates a black hole collapse (defined
by Walker, and Carlitz and Willey), and finally moving with constant velocity.
When the reflection and transmission coefficients are those in the model
proposed by Barton, Calogeracos, and Nicolaevici [$r(w)=-i\alpha/(\w+i\alpha)$
and $s(w)=\w/(\w+i\alpha)$, with $\alpha\geq 0$], the Bogoliubov coefficients
on the back side of the mirror can be computed exactly. This allows us to prove
that, when $\alpha$ is very large (case of an ideal, perfectly reflecting
mirror) a thermal emission of scalar massless particles obeying Bose-Einstein
statistics is radiated from the mirror (a black body radiation), in accordance
with results previously obtained in the literature. However, when $\alpha$ is
finite (semitransparent mirror, a physically realistic situation) the striking
result is obtained that the thermal emission of scalar massless particles obeys
Fermi-Dirac statistics. We also show here that the reverse change of statistics
takes place in a bidimensional fermionic model for massless particles, namely
that the Fermi-Dirac statistics for the completely reflecting situation will
turn into the Bose-Einstein statistics for a partially reflecting, physical
mirror.

relatively small are {\em almost surely} entangled, but that states of maximum
rank are not. More precisely, let $M=M_m(\mathbb C)$ and $N=M_n(\mathbb C)$ be
full matrix algebras with $m\geq n$, fix an arbitrary state $\omega$ of $N$,
and let $E(\omega)$ be the set of all states of $M\otimes N$ that extend
$\omega$. The space $E(\omega)$ contains states of rank $r$ for every
$r=1,2,...,m\cdot\rank\omega$, and it has a filtration into compact subspaces
$$ E^1(\omega)\subseteq E^2(\omega)\subseteq ...\subseteq
E^{m\cdot\rank\omega}=E(\omega), $$ where $E^r(\omega)$ is the set of all
states of $E(\omega)$ having rank $\leq r$.
  We show first that for every $r$, there is a real-analytic manifold $V^r$,
homogeneous under a transitive action of a compact group $G^r$, which
parameterizes $E^r(\omega)$. The unique $G^r$-invariant probability measure on
$V^r$ promotes to a probability measure $P^{r,\omega}$ on $E^r(\omega)$, and
$P^{r,\omega}$ assigns probability 1 to states of rank $r$. The resulting
probability space $(E^r(\omega),P^{r,\omega})$ represents ``choosing a rank $r$
extension of $\omega$ at random&quot;.
  Main result: For every $r=1,2,...,[\rank \omega/2]$, states of
$(E^r(\omega),P^{r,\omega})$ are almost surely entangled.

H. Bennett and G.
Brassard in 1984, describes how two spatially separated parties can generate a
random bit string fully known only to them by transmission of single-qubit
quantum states. Any attempt to eavesdrop on the protocol introduces disturbance
which can be detected by the legitimate parties. In this Master's Thesis a
novel modification to the BB84 protocol is analyzed. Instead of sending single
particles one-by-one as in BB84, they are grouped and a non-local
transformation is applied to each group before transmission. Each particle is
sent to the intended receiver, always delaying the transmission until the
receiver has acknowledged the previous particle on an authenticated classical
channel, restricting eavesdropping to accessing the quantum transmission one
particle at a time. Hence, an eavesdropper cannot undo the non-local
transformation perfectly. Even if perfect cloning of quantum states was
possible the state of the group could not be cloned. We calculate the maximal
information on the established key provided by an intercept-resend attack and
the induced disturbance for different transformations. We observe that it is
possible to significantly reduce the eavesdropper's maximal information on the
key--to one eighth of that in BB84 for a fixed, reasonable amount of
disturbance. We also show that the individual access to the particles poses a
fundamental restriction to the eavesdropper, and discuss a novel attack type
against the proposed protocol.

measurement problem -- is a pseudo-problem that depends for its legitimacy on
the acceptance of two dogmas. The first dogma is John Bell's assertion that
measurement should never be introduced as a primitive process in a fundamental
mechanical theory like classical or quantum mechanics, but should always be
open to a complete analysis, in principle, of how the individual outcomes come
about dynamically. The second dogma is the view that the quantum state has an
ontological significance analogous to the significance of the classical state
as the 'truthmaker' for propositions about the occurrence and non-occurrence of
events, i.e., that the quantum state is a representation of physical reality.
We show how both dogmas can be rejected in a realist information-theoretic
interpretation of quantum mechanics as an alternative to the Everett
interpretation. The Everettian, too, regards the 'big' measurement problem as a
pseudo-problem, because the Everettian rejects the assumption that measurements
have definite outcomes, in the sense that one particular outcome, as opposed to
other possible outcomes, actually occurs in a quantum measurement process. By
contrast with the Everettians, we accept that measurements have definite
outcomes. By contrast with the Bohmians and the GRW 'collapse' theorists who
add structure to the theory and propose dynamical solutions to the 'big'
measurement problem, we take the problem to arise from the failure to see the
significance of Hilbert space as a new kinematic framework for the physics of
an indeterministic universe, in the sense that Hilbert space imposes kinematic
(i.e., pre-dynamic) objective probabilistic constraints on correlations between
events.

matter and energy content of the universe. In this formalism, the physical laws
themselves are resonantly-selected and ordered in the universe cavity in a
hierarchical manner, and the values of fundamental constants are determined
through a Generalized Mach's Principle. The existence of a preferred reference
frame in this scenario is shown to be consistent with the relational nature of
the origin of physical laws. Covariant unitary evolution is shown to connect
smoothly with the reduction of wavefunction in the preferred frame during
quantum measurement. The superluminal nature of quantum processes in the lowest
hierarchy coexists with the universal speed limit obeyed by processes in higher
hierarchies. A natural quantum-to-classical transition is also obtained which
is stable against the diffusive tendency of the unitary quantum evolution
processes. In this formalism a realistic quasi-classical ontology is
established for the foundations of quantum mechanics.

  Bell inequalities</title><description>  We have determined numerically the maximum quantum violation of over 100
tight bipartite Bell inequalities with two-outcome measurements by each party
on systems of up to four dimensional Hilbert spaces. We have found several
cases, including the ones where each party has only four measurement choices,
where two dimensional systems, i.e., qubits are not sufficient to achieve
maximum violation. In a significant proportion of those cases when qubits are
sufficient, one or both parties have to make trivial, degenerate 'measurements'
in order to achieve maximum violation. The quantum state corresponding to the
maximum violation in most cases is not the maximally entangled one. We also
obtain the result, that bipartite quantum correlations can always be reproduced
by measurements and states which require only real numbers if there is no
restriction on the size of the local Hilbert spaces. Therefore, in order to
achieve maximum quantum violation on any bipartite Bell inequality (with any
number of settings and outcomes), there is no need to consider complex Hilbert
spaces.

codes known to date that combine the best features of all known passive and
active error-control schemes. The subsystem code is a subspace of the quantum
state space that is decomposed into a tensor product of two vector spaces: the
subsystem and the co-subsystem. A generic method to derive subsystem codes from
existing subsystem codes is given that allows one to trade the dimensions of
subsystem and co-subsystem while maintaining or improving the minimum distance.
As a consequence, it is shown that all pure MDS subsystem codes are derived
from MDS stabilizer codes. The existence of numerous families of MDS subsystem
codes is established. Propagation rules are derived that allow one to obtain
longer and shorter subsystem codes from given subsystem codes. Furthermore,
propagation rules are derived that allow one to construct a new subsystem code
by combining two given subsystem codes.

generalisation to describe the dynamics of systems confined to bounded domains.
Non-local boundary conditions can be introduced in Feynman's approach by means
of boundary amplitude distributions and complex phases to describe the quantum
dynamics in terms of the classical trajectories. The different prescriptions
involve only trajectories reaching the boundary and correspond to different
choices of boundary conditions of selfadjoint extensions of the Hamiltonian.
One dimensional particle dynamics is analysed in detail.

Kolmogorov complexity (QC), and rigorous mathematical proofs of its basic
properties. The definition used here is similar to that by Berthiaume, van Dam,
and Laplante. It defines the QC of some indeterminate-length qubit string \rho
as the minimum base length of any quantum input which makes a quantum Turing
machine (QTM) halt and output \rho, up to some error tolerance.
  First, we prove that there is a QTM which is universal in the sense of input
base length. Furthermore, we show several general properties of QTMs, including
a result on mutually orthogonal ``halting spaces'', and a way to transform
every almost-halting input into a deterministically-halting input by adding at
most a constant number of qubits.
  Afterwards, we apply these results to QC. In particular, we show that QC is
invariant, incompressible, agrees with classical Kolmogorov complexity for
classical strings, and is closely related to von Neumann entropy for ergodic
quantum information sources.

  Property</title><description>  Using the conformal equivalence of translational KMS states on chiral
theories with dilational KMS states obtained from restricting the vacuum state
to an interval (the chiral inversion of the Unruh-effect) it was shown in a
previous publications that the diverging volume (length) factor of the
thermodynamic limit corresponds to the logarithmic increase in the attenuation
length of the localization-caused vacuum polarization cloud near the causal
boundary. This is not a coincidence but rather a structural consequence of the
fact that both operator algebras are of the same unique von Neumann type which
is completely different from that met in quantum mechanical algebras. Together
with the technique of holographic projection this leads to the universal area
proportionality. The main aim in this paper is to present a derivation which is
more in the spirit of recent work on entanglement entropy in condensed matter
physics, especially to that of the replica trick as used by Cardy and
collaborators. The essential new ingredient is the use of the split property
which already has shown its constructive power in securing the existence of
models of factorizing theories.

a sample of r positions selected at random. Then, except with (exponentially in
r) small probability, the min-entropy of the sample is not smaller than,
roughly, a fraction r/n of the total min-entropy of all positions X_1, ...,
X_n, which is optimal. Here, we show that this statement, originally proven by
Vadhan [LNCS, vol. 2729, Springer, 2003] for the purely classical case, is
still true if the min-entropy is measured relative to a quantum system. Because
min-entropy quantifies the amount of randomness that can be extracted from a
given random variable, our result can be used to prove the soundness of locally
computable extractors in a context where side information might be
quantum-mechanical. In particular, it implies that key agreement in the
bounded-storage model (using a standard sample-and-hash protocol) is fully
secure against quantum adversaries, thus solving a long-standing open problem.

length. It is argued that the extension of these modes to the whole Fock-space

to protect their logical qubits from errors, and modeling the effectiveness of
QECCs on QCs is an important problem for evaluating the QC architecture. The
previously developed Monte Carlo (MC) error models may take days or weeks of
execution to produce an accurate result due to their random sampling approach.
We present an alternative analytical error model that generates, over the
course of executing the quantum program, a probability tree of the QC's error
states. By calculating the fidelity of the quantum program directly, this error
model has the potential for enormous speedups over the MC model when applied to
small yet useful problem sizes. We observe a speedup on the order of 1,000X
when accuracy is required, and we evaluate the scaling properties of this new
analytical error model.

forbidden-interval theorems for stochastic resonance. The fidelity measures
performance of quantum communication. The sender encodes the two classical bits
for quantum teleportation as weak bipolar subthreshold signals and sends them
over a noisy classical channel. Two forbidden-interval theorems provide a
necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of the nonmonotone
stochastic resonance effect in the fidelity of quantum teleportation. The
condition is that the noise mean must fall outside a forbidden interval related
to the detection threshold and signal value. An optimal amount of classical
noise benefits quantum communication when the sender transmits weak signals,
the receiver detects with a high threshold, and the noise mean lies outside the
forbidden interval. Theorems and simulations demonstrate that both
finite-variance and infinite-variance noise benefit the fidelity of quantum
teleportation.

change in shape. (3) After a sufficiently long period (related to the initial

momentum distribution in the packet. In this asymptotic regime, the shape of
the probability distribution no longer changes except for its scale, which
increases linearly with the time. (4) There is an infinite denumerable set of
simple wave packets (the Hermite-Gauss packets) that do not change shape as

postselection in different time bins, independent of the parameters of
