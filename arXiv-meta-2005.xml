  and quantum control of nonlinearity, dispersion, transparency and
  inversionless amplification in an extended strongly-absorbing
  inhomogeneously-broadened medium</title><description>  Specific features of nonlinear interference processes at quantum transitions
in near- and fully-resonant optically-dense Doppler-broadened medium are
studied. The feasibility of overcoming of the fundamental limitation on a
velocity-interval of resonantly coupled molecules imposed by the Doppler effect
is shown based on quantum coherence. This increases the efficiency of
nonlinear-optical processes in atomic and molecular gases that possess the most
narrow and strongest resonances. The possibility of all-optical switching of
the medium to opaque or, alternatively, to absolutely transparent, or even to
strongly-amplifying states is explored, which is controlled by a small
variation of two driving radiations. The required intensities of the control
fields are shown to be typical for cw lasers. These effects are associated with
four-wave mixing accompanied by Stokes gain and by their interference in fully-
and near-resonant optically-dense far-from-degenerate double-Lambda medium.
Optimum conditions for inversionless amplification of short-wavelength
radiation above the oscillation threshold at the expense of the
longer-wavelength control fields, as well as for Raman gain of the generated
idle infrared radiation, are investigated. The outcomes are illustrated with
numerical simulations applied to sodium dimer vapor. Similar schemes can be
realized in doped solids and in fiber optics.

  Electrodynamics</title><description>  We theoretically study the properties of highly prolate shaped dielectric
microresonators. Such resonators sustain whispering gallery modes that exhibit
two spatially well separated regions with enhanced field strength. The field
per photon on the resonator surface is significantly higher than e.g. for
equatorial whispering gallery modes in microsphere resonators with a comparable
mode volume. At the same time, the frequency spacing of these modes is much
more favorable, so that a tuning range of several free spectral ranges should
be attainable. We discuss the possible application of such resonators for
cavity quantum electrodynamics experiments with neutral atoms and reveal
distinct advantages with respect to existing concepts.

processing. Several proposals for quantum information transfer along linear
arrays of nearest-neighbor coupled qubits or spins were made recently. Perfect
transfer was shown to exist in two models with specifically designed strongly
inhomogeneous couplings. We show that perfect transfer occurs in an entire
class of chains, including systems whose nearest-neighbor couplings vary only
weakly along the chain. The key to these observations is the Jordan-Wigner
mapping of spins to noninteracting lattice fermions which display perfectly
periodic dynamics if the single-particle energy spectrum is appropriate. After
a half-period of that dynamics any state is transformed into its mirror image
with respect to the center of the chain. The absence of fermion interactions
preserves these features at arbitrary temperature and allows for the transfer
of nontrivially entangled states of several spins or qubits.

  free-space quantum channel</title><description>  We have distributed entangled photons directly through the atmosphere to a
receiver station 7.8 km away over the city of Vienna, Austria at night.
Detection of one photon from our entangled pairs constitutes a triggered single
photon source from the sender. With no direct time-stable connection, the two
stations found coincidence counts in the detection events by calculating the
cross-correlation of locally-recorded time stamps shared over a public internet
channel. For this experiment, our quantum channel was maintained for a total of
40 minutes during which time a coincidence lock found approximately 60000
coincident detection events. The polarization correlations in those events
yielded a Bell parameter, S=2.27/pm0.019, which violates the CHSH-Bell
inequality by 14 standard deviations. This result is promising for
entanglement-based free-space quantum communication in high-density urban
areas. It is also encouraging for optical quantum communication between ground
stations and satellites since the length of our free-space link exceeds the
atmospheric equivalent.

  quantum mechanics</title><description>  During the last decades there has been a relatively extensive attempt to
develop the theory of stochastic electrodynamics (SED) with a view to
establishing it as the foundation for quantum mechanics. The theory had several
important successes, but failed when applied to the study of particles subject
to nonlinear forces. An analysis of the failure showed that its reasons are not
to be ascribed to the principles of SED, but to the methods used to construct
the theory, particularly the use of a Fokker-Planck approximation and
perturbation theory. A new, non perturbative approach has been developed,
called linear stochastic electrodynamics (LSED), of which a clean form is
presented here. After introducing the fundamentals of SED, we discuss in detail
the principles on which LSED is constructed. We pay attention to the
fundamental issue of the mechanism that leads to the quantum behaviour of field
and matter, and demonstrate that indeed LSED is a natural way to the quantum
formalism by demanding its solutions to comply with a limited number of
principles, each one with a clear physical meaning. As a further application of
the principles of LSED we derive also the Planck distribution. In a final
section we revisit some of the most tantalizing quandaries of quantum mechanics
from the point of view offered by the present theory, and show that it offers a
clear physical answer to them.

  Photonic Crystals</title><description>  We demonstrate the ability to control the spontaneous emission dynamics of
self-assembled quantum dots via the local density of optical modes in
2D-photonic crystals. We show that an incomplete 2D photonic bandgap is
sufficient to significantly lengthen the spontaneous emission lifetime

are both \textit{spectrally} and \textit{spatially} coupled to strongly
localized ($V_{mode}\sim1.5(\lambda/n)^{3}$), high $Q\sim2700$ optical modes,
we have directly measured a strong Purcell enhanced shortening of the emission
lifetime $\geq5.6\times$, limited only by our temporal resolution. Analysis of
the spectral dependence of the recombination dynamics shows a maximum lifetime
shortening of $19\pm4$. From the directly measured enhancement and suppression
we show that the single mode coupling efficiency for quantum dots in such

projective measurement can find the system in an excited state. We show that
energy fluctuation measurements at zero temperature provide entanglement
information. For two-state systems which exhibit a persistent current in the
ground state, energy fluctuations and persistent current fluctuations are
closely related. The harmonic oscillator serves to illustrate energy
fluctuations in a system with an infinite number of states. In addition to the
energy distribution we discuss the energy-energy time-correlation function in

  Phase Separation and an upper bound for $\Delta$ for Fermi fluids in the

amounts of two species of fermion in the unitary regime $k_f a \to \infty$
(where $k_f$ is the Fermi momentum and $a$ the scattering length, and $\Delta$
is a pairing energy: the difference in energy per particle between adding to
the system a macroscopic number (but infinitesimal fraction) of particles of
one species compared to adding equal numbers of both. The bound is $\delta \leq
{5/3} (2 (2 \xi)^{2/5} - (2 \xi))$ where $\xi=\epsilon/\epsilon_{\rm FG}$,
$\delta= 2 \Delta/\epsilon_{\rm FG}$; $\epsilon$ is the energy per particle and
$\epsilon_{\rm FG}$ is the energy per particle of a noninteracting Fermi gas.
If the bound is saturated, then systems with unequal densities of the two
species will separate spatially into a superfluid phase with equal numbers of
the two species and a normal phase with the excess. If the bound is not
saturated then $\Delta$ is the usual superfluid gap. If the superfluid gap
exceeds the maximum allowed by the inequality phase separation occurs.

realistic modeling at the quantum level is possible using standard techniques

We develop a general multidimensional theory of the geometric phase for

We show that the geometric phase is exactly $\pi$ for symmetric complex
Hamiltonians of arbitrary dimension and for nonsymmetric non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians of dimension 2. For nonsymmetric non-Hermitian Hamiltonians of
higher dimension, the geometric phase tends to $\pi$ for small cycles and
changes as the cycle size and shape are varied. We find explicitly the leading
asymptotic term of this dependence, and describe it in terms of interaction of

distinguishing hidden subgroup states. We show that the optimal measurement for
solving this problem is the so-called pretty good measurement. We then prove
that the success probability of this measurement exhibits a sharp threshold as
a function of the density nu=k/log N, where k is the number of copies of the
hidden subgroup state and 2N is the order of the dihedral group. In particular,
for nu&lt;1 the optimal measurement (and hence any measurement) identifies the
hidden subgroup with a probability that is exponentially small in log N, while
for nu&gt;1 the optimal measurement identifies the hidden subgroup with a
probability of order unity. Thus the dihedral group provides an example of a
group G for which Omega(log|G|) hidden subgroup states are necessary to solve
the hidden subgroup problem. We also consider the optimal measurement for
determining a single bit of the answer, and show that it exhibits the same
threshold. Finally, we consider implementing the optimal measurement by a
quantum circuit, and thereby establish further connections between the dihedral
hidden subgroup problem and average case subset sum problems. In particular, we
show that an efficient quantum algorithm for a restricted version of the
optimal measurement would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the subset
sum problem, and conversely, that the ability to quantum sample from subset sum
solutions allows one to implement the optimal measurement.

constitutes a representation of the Lorentz group. The associated Poincare
sphere is a geometric representation of the Lorentz group. Since the Lorentz
group preserves the determinant of the density matrix, it cannot accommodate
the decoherence process through the decaying off-diagonal elements of the
density matrix, which yields to an incerese in the value of the determinant. It
is noted that the O(3,2) deSitter group contains two Lorentz subgroups. The
change in the determinant in one Lorentz group can be compensated by the other.
It is thus possible to describe the decoherence process as a symmetry
transformation in the O(3,2) space. It is shown also that these two coupled
Lorentz groups can serve as a concrete example of Feynman's rest of the

Hamiltonian operator must be Hermitian in order that the energy levels be real
and that the theory be unitary (probability conserving). To express the
Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian, one writes $H=H^\dagger$, where the symbol
$\dagger$ denotes the usual Dirac Hermitian conjugation; that is, transpose and
complex conjugate. In the past few years it has been recognized that the
requirement of Hermiticity, which is often stated as an axiom of quantum
mechanics, may be replaced by the less mathematical and more physical
requirement of space-time reflection symmetry (PT symmetry) without losing any
of the essential physical features of quantum mechanics. Theories defined by
non-Hermitian PT-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit strange and unexpected
properties at the classical as well as at the quantum level. This paper
explains how the requirement of Hermiticity can be evaded and discusses the
properties of some non-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum theories.

the sextic QES Hamiltonians in the literature because their eigenfunctions obey
PT-symmetric rather than Hermitian boundary conditions. These new Hamiltonians
present a novel problem that is not encountered when the Hamiltonian is
Hermitian: It is necessary to distinguish between the parametric region of
unbroken PT symmetry, in which all of the eigenvalues are real, and the region
of broken PT symmetry, in which some of the eigenvalues are complex. The
precise location of the boundary between these two regions is determined
numerically using extrapolation techniques and analytically using WKB analysis.

generally for functions of the form f:S-&gt;T. We call these measures sumPI and
maxPI. The quantity sumPI has been emerging through a line of research on
quantum query complexity lower bounds via the so-called quantum adversary
method [Amb02, Amb03, BSS03, Zha04, LM04], culminating in [SS04] with the
realization that these many different formulations are in fact equivalent.
Given that sumPI turns out to be such a robust invariant of a function, we
begin to investigate this quantity in its own right and see that it also has
applications to classical complexity theory.
  As a surprising application we show that sumPI^2(f) is a lower bound on the
formula size, and even, up to a constant multiplicative factor, the
probabilistic formula size of f. We show that several formula size lower bounds
in the literature, specifically Khrapchenko and its extensions [Khr71, Kou93],
including a key lemma of [Has98], are in fact special cases of our method.
  The second quantity we introduce, maxPI(f), is always at least as large as
sumPI(f), and is derived from sumPI in such a way that maxPI^2(f) remains a
lower bound on formula size. While sumPI(f) is always a lower bound on the
quantum query complexity of f, this is not the case in general for maxPI(f). A
strong advantage of sumPI(f) is that it has both primal and dual
characterizations, and thus it is relatively easy to give both upper and lower
bounds on the sumPI complexity of functions. To demonstrate this, we look at a
few concrete examples, for three functions: recursive majority of three, a
function defined by Ambainis, and the collision problem.

described by conventional models of stars clusters dynamics. The single mass
component, the spherical symmetry and no stars evolution are here accurate
assumptions. The analog of binary stars formations in the cluster case is
three-body recombination in Rydberg atoms in the plasma case with the same
Heggie's law: soft binaries get softer and hard binaries get harder. We
demonstrate that the evolution of such an ultracold plasma is dominated by
Fokker-Planck kinetics equations formally identical to the ones controlling the
evolution of a stars cluster. The Virial theorem leads to a link between the
plasma temperature and the ions and electrons numbers. The Fokker-Planck
equation is approximate using gaseous and fluid models. We found that the
electrons are in a Kramers-Michie-King's type quasi-equilibrium distribution as
stars in clusters. Knowing the electron distribution and using forced fast
electron extraction we are able to determine the plasma temperature knowing the
trapping potential depth.

recovered by means of an &quot;appropriate limit&quot; of Quantum Mechanics. In the same
spirit it is reasonable to enquire about the fundamental geometric structures
of Classical Mechanics which will survive the appropriate limit of Quantum
Mechanics. This is the case for the symplectic structure. On the contrary, such
geometric structures as the metric tensor and the complex structure, which are
necessary for the formulation of the Quantum theory, may not survive the
Classical limit, being not relevant in the Classical theory. Here we discuss
the Classical limit of those geometric structures mainly in the Ehrenfest and
Heisenberg pictures, i.e. at the level of observables rather than at the level
of states. A brief discussion of the fate of the complex structure in the
Quantum-Classical transition in the Schroedinger picture is also mentioned.

the latter our definition of the transmission time coincides, in the limit of

the cases the main feature to distinguish our concept from others is that the
average starting point of transmitted (reflected) particles does not coincide
with that of all particles. One has to stress here that there is no such an

simultaneously. For measuring the position of the average starting point of

self-orthogonal classical Goppa codes with respect to a weighted inner product.
These codes are also self-orthogonal with respect to a symplectic inner product

states, necessary and sufficient conditions on a quantum measurement minimizing
the probability of a detection error have been derived. In this work, we assume
that each of the states in our collection is a mixture of a known state and an

minimization of the worst-case probability of a detection error. For the second
we assume a probability distribution on the unknown states, and minimize of the
expected probability of a detection error.
  We find that under both criteria, the optimal detectors are equivalent to the
optimal detectors of an ``effective ensemble''. In the worst-case, the
effective ensemble is comprised of the known states with altered prior
probabilities, and in the average case it is made up of altered states with the
original prior probabilities.

of players. By this formulism, a new way to find the equilibria of games is
given by generalizing the thermodynamical evolutionary process leading to
equilibrium in Statistical Mechanics. And in this formulism, when quantum
objects instead of classical objects are used as the objects in the game, it's
naturally leads to the so-called Quantum Game Theory, but with a slight
difference in the definition of strategy state of players: the probability
distribution is replaced with a density matrix. Further more, both games of
correlated and independent players can be reached in this single framework,
while traditionally, they are treated separately by Non-cooperative Game Theory
and Coalitional Game Theory. Because of the density matrix is used as state of
players, besides classical correlated strategy, quantum entangled states can
also be used as strategies, which is an entanglement of strategies between
players, and it is different with the entanglement of objects' states as in the
so-called Quantum Game Theory. At last, in the form of density matrix, a class

Our results lead to the conclusion that both measures can drop by an arbitrary

known as &quot;locking&quot; and has previously been observed for other correlation
measures, such as the accessible information, entanglement cost and the

  In the case of squashed entanglement, the results are obtained with the help
of an inequality that can be understood as a quantum channel analogue of
well-known entropic uncertainty relations. This inequality may prove a useful
tool in quantum information theory.
  The regularised entanglement of purification is known to equal the
entanglement needed to prepare a many copies of quantum state by local
operations and a sublinear amount of communication. Here, monogamy of quantum
entanglement (i.e., the impossibility of a system being maximally entangled
with two others at the same time) leads to an exact calculation for all quantum
states that are supported either on the symmetric or on the antisymmetric

which limits it to systems with density matrices defined on complex Hilbert

possible to define a phase space and Wigner functions in close analogy to the
continuous case. That is, we use a phase space that is a direct sum of n
two-dimensional vector spaces each containing p^2 points. This is in contrast
to the more usual choice of a two-dimensional phase space containing p^(2n)

formulated by the second quantized formulation. This formulation exhibits a
hidden local gauge symmetry related to the arbitrariness of the phase choice of
the complete orthonormal basis set. By using this second quantized formulation,
which does not assume adiabatic approximation, a convenient exact formula for
the geometric terms including off-diagonal geometric terms is derived. The
analysis of geometric phases is then reduced to a simple diagonalization of the
Hamiltonian, and it is analyzed both in the operator and path integral
formulations. If one diagonalizes the geometric terms in the infinitesimal
neighborhood of level crossing, the geometric phases become trivial (and thus
no monopole singularity) for arbitrarily large but finite time interval $T$.
The integrability of Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation and the appearance of the
seemingly non-integrable phases are thus consistent. The topological proof of
the Longuet-Higgins' phase-change rule, for example, fails in the practical
Born-Oppenheimer approximation where a large but finite ratio of two time
scales is involved and $T$ is identified with the period of the slower system.
The difference and similarity between the geometric phases associated with
level crossing and the exact topological object such as the Aharonov-Bohm phase
become clear in the present formulation. A crucial difference between the
quantum anomaly and the geometric phases is also noted.

  aspects of quantum error correction</title><description>  Various aspects of distillation of noisy entanglement and some associated
effects in quantum error correction are considered. In particular we prove that
if only one--way classical communication (from Alice to Bob) is allowed and the
shared $d \otimes d$ state is not pure then there is a threshold for optimal
entanglement fraction $F$ of the state (being an overlap between the shared
state and symmetric maximally entangled state) which can be obtained in single
copy distillation process. This implies that to get (probabilistically)
arbitrary good conclusive teleportation via mixed state at least one classical
bit of backward communication (for Bob to Alice) has to be sent. We provide
several other threshold properties in this context including in particular the
existence of ultimate threshold of optimal $F$ for states of full rank. Finally
the threshold results are linked to those of error correction. Namely it is
pointed out that in quantum computer working on fixed number of quantum bits
almost any kind of noise can be (probabilistically) corrected only to some
threshold error bar though there are some (rare) exceptions.

implemented with a fidelity greater than 79.3% and a consumption of less than
0.969 ebits and 2 classical bits, when $\xi\leq0.353$. This provides a higher
bound for the feasible operation compared to the former techniques
\cite{Cirac,Groisman,Bennett-1}. Besides, gates with $\xi\geq0.353$ can be
implemented with the probability 79.3% and a consumption of 0.969 ebits, which
is the same efficiency as the distillation-based protocol
\cite{Groisman,Bennett-1}, while our method saves extra classical resource.
Gates with $\xi\to0$ can be implemented with nearly unit probability and a
small entanglement. We also generalize some application to the multiple system,
where we find it is possible to implement certain nonlocal gates between many
non-entangled partners using a non-maximally multiple entangled state.

different quantum signatures of classical chaos. Here we study entanglement
production in coupled chaotic systems as a possible quantum indicator of
classical chaos. We use coupled kicked tops as a model for our extensive
numerical studies. We find that, in general, presence of chaos in the system
produces more entanglement. However, coupling strength between two subsystems
is also very important parameter for the entanglement production. Here we show
how chaos can lead to large entanglement which is universal and describable by
random matrix theory (RMT). We also explain entanglement production in coupled
strongly chaotic systems by deriving a formula based on RMT. This formula is
valid for arbitrary coupling strengths, as well as for sufficiently long time.
Here we investigate also the effect of chaos on the entanglement production for
the mixed initial state. We find that many properties of the mixed state
entanglement production are qualitatively similar to the pure state
entanglement production. We however still lack an analytical understanding of
the mixed state entanglement production in chaotic systems.

the many-photon processes gives rise to the inelastic part of the atomic
fluorescence, which, for a two-level system, has a well-known characteristic
three-peak structure known as the Mollow spectrum. From a theoretical point of
view, the Mollow spectrum finds a natural interpretation in terms of
transitions among laser-dressed states which are the energy eigenstates of a
second-quantized two-level system strongly coupled to a driving laser field. As
recently shown, the quasi-energies of the laser-dressed states receive
radiative corrections which are nontrivially different from the results which

Within the regime of linear response in terms of a first order expansion of the
mirror's displacement, the coarse-grained effective action is obtained by
integrating out quantum fields with the method of influence functional. The
semiclassical Langevin equation is derived, and is found to involve two levels
of backreaction effects on the dynamics of mirrors: radiation reaction induced
by the motion of the mirror and backreaction dissipation arising from
fluctuations in quantum fields via a fluctuation-dissipation relation. Although
the theorem of fluctuation and dissipation in linear response theory is of
model independence, the study from the first principles derivation shows that
the obtained theorem is also {\it independent} of the regulators introduced to
deal with short-distance divergences from quantum fields. Thus, when the method
of regularization is introduced to compute the dissipation and fluctuation
effects, this theorem must be fulfilled as the results are obtained by taking
the short-distance limit in the end of calculations. The backreaction effects
from vacuum fluctuations on moving mirrors are found to be hardly detected

  two-particle entanglement</title><description>  We present a way for symmetric multiparty-controlled teleportation of an
arbitrary two-particle entangled state based on Bell-basis measurements by
using two Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, i.e., a sender transmits an
arbitrary two-particle entangled state to a distant receiver, an arbitrary one
of the $n+1$ agents via the control of the others in a network. It will be
shown that the outcomes in the cases that $n$ is odd or it is even are
different in principle as the receiver has to perform a controlled-not
operation on his particles for reconstructing the original arbitrary entangled
state in addition to some local unitary operations in the former. Also we
discuss the applications of this controlled teleporation for quantum secret
sharing of classical and quantum information. As all the instances can be used
to carry useful information, its efficiency for qubits approaches the maximal
value.

where a set of EPR pairs of maximally entangled particles in Bell states,
initially made by the supervisor Charlie, but shared by the sender Alice and
the receiver Bob, functions as quantum information channels for faithful
transmission. After insuring the security of the quantum channel and obtaining
the permission of Charlie (i.e. Charlie is trustworthy and cooperative, which
means the 'conditional' in the two schemes), Alice and Bob begin their private
communication under the control of Charlie. In the first scheme, Alice
transmits secret message to Bob in a deterministic manner with the help of
Charlie by means of Alice's local unitary transformations, both Alice and Bob's
local measurements, and both of Alice and Charlie's public classical
communication. In the second scheme, the secure communication between Alice and
Bob can be achieved via public classical communication of Charlie and Alice,
and the local measurements of both Alice and Bob. The common feature of these
protocols is that the communications between two communication parties Alice
and Bob depend on the agreement of the third side Charlie. Moreover,
transmitting one bit secret message, the sender Alice only needs to apply a
local operation on her one qubit and send one bit classical information. We
also show that the two schemes are completely secure if quantum channels are
perfect.

  Mechanics</title><description>  In this paper we introduce the three main notions of probability used by
physicists and discuss how these are to be used when invoking spacelike
separated observers in a relativistic format. We discuss a standard EPRB
experiment and concentrate upon problems of the interpretation of
probabilities. We promote a particularly conservative interpretation of this
experiment (which need not invoke an objective notion of collapse) where
probabilities are, tentatively, passively Lorentz invariant. We also argue that
the Heisenberg picture is preferable in relativistic situations due to a
conflict between the Schrodinger picture and passive Lorentz transformations of
probabilities. Throughout most of this paper we discuss the relative frequency
interpretation of probability as this is most commonly used. We also introduce
the logically necessary notion of `prior-frequency' in discussing whether the
choice by an observer can have any causal effect upon the measurement results
of another. We also critically examine the foundational use of relative
frequency in no-signalling theorems. We argue that SQT and SR are
probabilistically compatible, although we do not discuss whether they are
compatible on the level of individual events.

two spin-$\frac 12$ quantum systems is decreased during teleportation via the
thermal mixed state in 1D Heisenberg chain. The entanglement teleportation will
be realized if the minimal entanglement of the thermal mixed state is provided
in such quantum channel. High average fidelity of teleportation with values

expectation value of any observable becomes diagonal in the eigenstates of the
total Hamiltonian for systems endowed with a continuous energy spectrum, and
(2), that this process can be interpreted as decoherence. We evaluate the first
claim in the context of a simple spin bath model. We find that even for large
environments, corresponding to an approximately continuous energy spectrum,
diagonalization of the expectation value of random observables does in general
not occur. We explain this result and conjecture that SID is likely to fail
also in other systems composed of discrete subsystems. Regarding the second
claim, we emphasize that SID does not describe a physically meaningful
decoherence process for individual measurements, but only involves destructive
interference that occurs collectively within an ensemble of presupposed
&quot;values&quot; of measurements. This leads us to question the relevance of SID for
treating observed decoherence effects.

theory fails to explain physical properties like the eigenvalue spectrum even
qualitatively, even if the asymptotic perturbation series is augmented by
resummation prescriptions to &quot;cure&quot; the divergence in large orders of
perturbation theory. Generalizations of perturbation theory are necessary which
include instanton configurations, characterized by nonanalytic factors
exp(-a/g) where a is a constant and g is the coupling. In the case of
one-dimensional quantum mechanical potentials with two or more degenerate
minima, the energy levels may be represented as an infinite sum of terms each
of which involves a certain power of a nonanalytic factor and represents itself
an infinite divergent series. We attempt to provide a unified representation of
related derivations previously found scattered in the literature. For the
considered quantum mechanical problems, we discuss the derivation of the
instanton contributions from a semi-classical calculation of the corresponding
partition function in the path integral formalism. We also explain the relation
with the corresponding WKB expansion of the solutions of the Schroedinger
equation, or alternatively of the Fredholm determinant det(H-E) (and some
explicit calculations that verify this correspondence). We finally recall how
these conjectures naturally emerge from a leading-order summation of
multi-instanton contributions to the path integral representation of the
partition function. The same strategy could result in new conjectures for
problems where our present understanding is more limited.

constributions to the partition function, using the formalism introduced in the

anharmonic oscillators with radial symmetry, and (iv) a specific potential
which bears an analogy with the Fokker-Planck equation. The latter potential
has the peculiar property that the perturbation series for the ground-state
energy vanishes to all orders and is thus formally convergent (the ground-state
energy, however, is nonzero and positive). For the potentials (ii), (iii), and
(iv), we calculate the perturbative B-function as well as the instanton
A-function to fourth order in g. We also consider the double-well potential in

detector acts as a chaotic bath and induces decoherence of the qubit. We

Moreover, we show that, for strong enough qubit-detector coupling, the
dephasing rate is given by the rate of exponential instability of the

Finally, we discuss the measurement in the regimes of strong and weak
qubit-detector coupling. For the case of strong coupling the detector performs
a measurement of the up/down state of the qubit. In the case of weak coupling,
due to chaos, the dynamical evolution of the detector is strongly sensitive to
the state of the qubit. However, in this case it is unclear how to extract a
signal from any measurement with a coarse-graining in the phase space on a size
much larger than the Planck cell.

taken from concepts used in quantum computation. The proof that weakest

dispersing and absorbing magnetodielectric bodies is presented, which is based
on QED in linear, causal media. Both ground-state and excited atoms are
considered. Whereas the Casimir-Polder force acting on a ground-state atom can
conveniently be derived from a perturbative calculation of the atom-field
coupling energy, an atom in an excited state is subject to transient force
components that can only be fully understood by a dynamical treatment based on
the body-assisted vacuum Lorentz force. The results show that the
Casimir-Polder force can be influenced by the body-induced broadening and
shifting of atomic transitions - an effect that is not accounted for within
lowest-order perturbation theory. The theory is used to study the
Casimir-Polder force of a ground-state atom placed within a magnetodielectric
multilayer system, with special emphasis on thick and thin plates as well as a
planar cavity consisting of two thick plates. It is shown how the competing
attractive and repulsive force components related to the electric and magnetic
properties of the medium, respectively, can - for sufficiently strong magnetic

continuous variable systems under the action of a quantum optical master
equation resulting from the interaction with general Gaussian uncorrelated
environments. The rate of decoherence is quantified by relating it to the decay
rates of various, complementary measures of the quantum nature of a state, such
as the purity, some nonclassicality indicators in phase space and, for two-mode
states, entanglement measures and total correlations between the modes.
Different sets of physically relevant initial configurations are considered,
including one- and two-mode Gaussian states, number states, and coherent
superpositions. Our analysis shows that, generally, the use of initially
squeezed configurations does not help to preserve the coherence of Gaussian
states, whereas it can be effective in protecting coherent superpositions of
both number states and Gaussian wave packets.

  local measurements and classical communication</title><description>  We initially consider a quantum system consisting of two qubits, which can be
in one of two nonorthogonal states, \Psi_0 or \Psi_1. We distribute the qubits
to two parties, Alice and Bob. They each measure their qubit and then compare
their measurement results to determine which state they were sent. This
procedure is error-free, which implies that it must sometimes fail. In
addition, no quantum memory is required; it is not necessary to store one of
the qubits until the result of the measurement on the other is known. We
consider the cases in which, should failure occur, both parties receive a
failure signal or only one does. In the latter case, if the states share the
same Schmidt basis, the states can be discriminated with the same failure
probability as would be obtained if the two qubits were measured together. This
scheme is sufficiently simple that it can be generalized to multipartite qubit
and qudit states. Applications to quantum secret sharing are discussed.
Finally, we present an optical scheme to experimenatlly realize the protocol in
the case of two qubits.

multi-stack machines, and multi-counter machines are equivalent, that is, they
can simulate each other in polynomial time. In quantum computation, Yao [11]
first proved that for any quantum Turing machines $M$, there exists quantum
Boolean circuit $(n,t)$-simulating $M$, where $n$ denotes the length of input
strings, and $t$ is the number of move steps before machine stopping. However,
the simulations of quantum Turing machines by quantum multi-stack machines and
quantum multi-counter machines have not been considered, and quantum
multi-stack machines have not been established, either. Though quantum counter
machines were dealt with by Kravtsev [6] and Yamasaki {\it et al.} [10], in
which the machines count with $0,\pm 1$ only, we sense that it is difficult to
simulate quantum Turing machines in terms of this fashion of quantum computing
devices, and we therefore prove that the quantum multi-counter machines allowed
to count with $0,\pm 1,\pm 2,...,\pm n$ for some $n&gt;1$ can efficiently simulate
quantum Turing machines.
  Therefore, our mail goals are to establish quantum multi-stack machines and
quantum multi-counter machines with counts $0,\pm 1,\pm 2,...,\pm n$ and $n&gt;1$,
and particularly to simulate quantum Turing machines by these quantum computing
devices.

within an isolated, closed system composed of non-interacting identical
particles with energy levels e_i with i=1,2,...,N. The time-dependent
occupation probabilities p_i(t) are assumed to obey the nonlinear rate
equations tau dp_i/dt=-p_i ln p_i+ alpha(t)p_i-beta(t)e_ip_i where alpha(t) and
beta(t) are functionals of the p_i(t)'s that maintain invariant the mean energy
E=sum_i e_ip_i(t) and the normalization condition 1=sum_i p_i(t). The entropy
S(t)=-k sum_i p_i(t) ln p_i(t) is a non-decreasing function of time until the
initially nonzero occupation probabilities reach a Boltzmann-like canonical
distribution over the occupied energy eigenstates. Initially zero occupation
probabilities, instead, remain zero at all times. The solutions p_i(t) of the
rate equations are unique and well-defined for arbitrary initial conditions
p_i(0) and for all times. Existence and uniqueness both forward and backward in
time allows the reconstruction of the primordial lowest entropy state. The time
evolution is at all times along the local direction of steepest entropy ascent
or, equivalently, of maximal entropy generation. These rate equations have the
same mathematical structure and basic features of the nonlinear dynamical
equation proposed in a series of papers ended with G.P.Beretta, Found.Phys.,

diagonalizing the transfer matrix and by a Bloch function ansatz. Remarkably,

issue of \emph{instrumental realism}, the issue of whether (as for EPR in the
original form or EPRB, Bohm's versions using spin) or not (as for GHZ)
observables have values that preexist measurement. Instrumental realism in the
EPR context helps us prove that in some special circumstances, one can get
simultaneous knowledge of two conjugate quantities, which in particular make
sense together. This shatters the axiomatic presentation of Quantum Mechanics.
This simultaneous knowledge of two conjugate quantities elaborates on 1935 work
by Schr{\&quot;o}dinger, hence the name, \emph{Schr{\&quot;o}dinger Unorthodoxy Theorem},
given to the second main result that is easily deduced from the result on
instrumental realism. Once the axiomatic edifice of Quantum Mechanics is
broken, we can let go the completeness of the wave function as suggested in
EPR, and hold fast on locality. The EPR paper of mid-1935 gets here contrasted,
from a new point of view, with a 1936 text where Einstein avoids using
counterfactuals. Counterfactuals get a precise definition and the corresponding
concept is used all along, but may be new under an old name. We provide a short
critical review of Bell's 1964 paper. Then, a small modification of arguments
for the Schr{\&quot;o}dinger Unorthodoxy Theorem will let appear a simple
conservation law, combined with the Malus Law, as the origin of the correlation
in Bell's version of EPRB: this is our third main result. As the fourth main
result, a last use of the concept of counterfactual yields the decay of
geometry at small enough scale. This opens a new world of interpretation of
aspects of Quantum Mechanics, aspects that range from measurement and the need
of classical physics to views on what realism should mean in microphysics.

dense coding, and quantum teleportation. With a trapped ion placed inside a
high finesse optical cavity, interacting with field of an external laser and
quantized cavity field, a scheme to generate a maximally entangled three qubit
GHZ state, is proposed. The dynamics of tripartite entanglement is
investigated, using negativity as an entanglement measure and linear entropy as
a measure of mixedness of a state. It is found that (a) the number of modes
available to the subsystem determines the maximum entanglement of a subsystem,
b) at entanglement maxima and minima, linear entropy and negativity uniquely
determine the nature of state, but the two measures do not induce the same
ordering of states, and c) for a special choice of system parameters maximally
entangled tripartite two mode GHZ state is generated. The scheme presented for
GHZ state generation is a single step process and is reduction free.

simultaneously, all proofs of Bell's Theorem violate Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle. This assumption is made in the original form of Bell's inequality,
in Wigner's probability inequalities, and in the ``nonlocality without
inequalities'' arguments. The introduction of time into derivations of these
variants of Bell's theorem results in extra terms related to the time order of
the measurements used in constructing correlation coefficients. Since the same
locality assumptions are made in the Heisenberg-compliant derivations of this
paper, only time-independent classical local hidden variable theories are
forbidden by violations of the original Bell inequalities; time-dependent
quantum local hidden variable theories can satisfy this new bound and agree
with experiment. We further point out that factorizable wavefunctions have been
used to describe some EPR experiments and can be used to describe others. These
will generate local de Broglie-Bohm trajectories in the description of the
data. This second, independent, line of argument also shows that violation of
Bell's inequality is only evidence that Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle
cannot be ignored.

hot and a cold reservoir to extract work. Here both reservoirs are quantum
systems and a heat engine is described by a unitary transformation which
decreases the average energy of the bipartite system. On the molecular scale,
the ability of implementing such a unitary heat engine is closely connected to
the ability of performing logical operations and classical computing. This is
shown by several examples:
  (1) The most elementary heat engine is a SWAP-gate acting on 1 hot and 1 cold
two-level systems with different energy gaps.
  (2) An optimal unitary heat engine on a pair of 3-level systems can directly
implement OR and NOT gates, as well as copy operations. The ability to
implement this heat engine on each pair of 3-level systems taken from the hot
and the cold ensemble therefore allows universal classical computation.
  (3) Optimal heat engines operating on one hot and one cold oscillator mode
with different frequencies are able to calculate polynomials and roots
approximately.
  (4) An optimal heat engine acting on 1 hot and n cold 2-level systems with
different level spacings can even solve the NP-complete problem KNAPSACK.
Whereas it is already known that the determination of ground states of
interacting many-particle systems is NP-hard, the optimal heat engine is a
thermodynamic problem which is NP-hard even for n non-interacting spin systems.
This result suggest that there may be complexity-theoretic limitations on the
efficiency of molecular heat engines.

that, prior to what appears to be a ``which-way'' measurement, an interference
pattern exists. Afshar has claimed that this result constitutes a violation of
the Principle of Complementarity. This paper discusses the implications of this
experiment and considers how Cramer's Transactional Interpretation easily
accomodates the result. It is also shown that the Afshar experiment is
analogous in key respects to a spin one-half particle prepared as ``spin up
along $\bf x$'', subjected to a nondestructive confirmation of that
preparation, and post-selected in a specific state of spin along $\bf z$.
 The terminology ``which-way'' or ``which-slit'' is critiqued; it is argued
that this usage by both Afshar and his critics is misleading and has
contributed to confusion surrounding the interpretation of the experiment.
Nevertheless, it is concluded that
 Bohr would have had no more problem accounting for the Afshar result than he
would in accounting for the aforementioned pre- and post-selection spin
experiment, in which the particle's preparation state is confirmed by a
nondestructive measurement prior to post-selection. In addition, some new
inferences about the interpretation of delayed choice experiments are drawn
from the analysis.

processing to capture the principle of complementarity. While constructions of
maximal sets of d+1 such bases are known for systems of prime power dimension
d, it is unknown whether this bound can be achieved for any non-prime power

quantum annealing (QA) in comparison with classical annealing (CA). Three
simple one dimensional case study systems are considered, namely a parabolic
well, a double well, and a curved washboard. The time dependent Schr\&quot;odinger
evolution in either real or imaginary time describing QA is contrasted with the
Fokker Planck evolution of CA. The asymptotic decrease of excess energy with
annealing time is studied in each case, and the reasons for differences are
examined and discussed. The Huse-Fisher classical power law of double well CA
is replaced with a different power law in QA. The multi-well washboard problem
studied in CA by Shinomoto and Kabashima and leading classically to a
logarithmic annealing even in the absence of disorder, turns to a power law
behavior when annealed with QA. The crucial role of disorder and localization
is briefly discussed.

Two-level systems can be described by an SE with a particular form of the

A modified version of the two-slit experiment is proposed in which
the moveable detector/counter used to obtain the fringe distribution by
counting single photons at different positions on the screen plane is replaced
with a mirror positioned at an angle to the screen plane. A single photon
arriving at the mirror through one of the slits is reflected at one of two
angles along one of two divergent paths. It is then detected by one of two
detectors, one on each of the paths, for different positions of the mirror on
the screen plane. This modification results in the ability to generate which
way information based on the path taken by the reflected photon as well as the
distribution of photon counts on the screen plane, one for each slit. Since the
photon does not experience any change other than the reflection at the mirror
the question whether fringes are also present because of a priori interference
effects when no mirror is present can be answered by examining the two a
posteriori distributions. Three possible outcomes are considered and
explanations proposed for them. The experiment is shown to be feasible with
existing technology and can be performed in most physics laboratories.

switched on at the pulse storage stage changes the phase relations between the
atomic coherences due to the stored pulse, which leads to an essential

released pulse and the coherences are given. A general situation when the two

Zalka and Faoro [PRA, 62, 030301]. We study the entangling power of
permutations, given in terms of a combinatorial formula. We show that the
permutation matrices with zero entangling power are, up to local unitaries, the
identity and the swap. We construct the permutations with the minimum nonzero
entangling power for every dimension. With the use of orthogonal latin squares,
we construct the permutations with the maximum entangling power for every
dimension. Moreover, we show that the value obtained is maximum over all
unitaries of the same dimension, with possible exception for 36. Our result
enables us to construct generic examples of 4-qudits maximally entangled states
for all dimensions except for 2 and 6. We numerically classify, according to
their entangling power, the permutation matrices of dimension 4 and 9, and we
give some estimates for higher dimensions.

photons. These single photons are used directly to encode classical information
in a quantum secret sharing process. In this protocol, all members in group 1
directly encode their respective keys on the states of single photons via
unitary operations, then the last one (the $m^{th}$ member of group 1) sends
$1/n$ of the resulting qubits to each of group 2. Thus the secret message
shared by all members of group 1 is shared by all members of group 2 in such a
way that no subset of each group is efficient to read the secret message, but
the entire set (not only group 1 but also group 2) is. We also show that it is
unconditionally secure. This protocol is feasible with present-day techniques.

The quantum setting offers a polynomial speedup with {\it bit} queries and an

of the general theory of quantum multiple access channels, and we may apply the
established formulas for the capacity region to it. However, the binary adder
channel is of particular interest classically, which motivates our generalizing
it to the quantum domain. It turns out to be a very nice case study not only of
multi-user quantum information theory, but also on the role entanglement plays
there. It turns out that the analogous classical situation, the multi-user
channel supported by shared randomness, is not distinct from the channel
without shared randomness, as far as rates are concerned. However, we discuss
the effect the new resource has on error probabilities, in an appendix.
  We focus specially on the effect entanglement between the senders as well as

of these cases one can devise rather simple codes meeting the capacity bounds,
even in a zero-error model, which is in marked difference to code construction

distribution (QKD) protocols. It is based on direct information-theoretic
arguments and thus also applies if no equivalent entanglement purification
scheme can be found. Using this technique, we investigate a general class of
QKD protocols with one-way classical post-processing. We show that, in order to
analyze the full security of these protocols, it suffices to consider
collective attacks. Indeed, we give new lower and upper bounds on the
secret-key rate which only involve entropies of two-qubit density operators and
which are thus easy to compute. As an illustration of our results, we analyze
the BB84, the six-state, and the B92 protocol with one-way error correction and
privacy amplification. Surprisingly, the performance of these protocols is
increased if one of the parties adds noise to the measurement data before the
error correction. In particular, this additional noise makes the protocols more
robust against noise in the quantum channel.

collapse-inducing operator, constructed from quantum fields, is a manifestly
covariant generalization of the mass density operator utilized in the
nonrelativistic Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) wave function
collapse model. However, the model is not Lorentz invariant because two such
operators do not commute at spacelike separation, i.e., the time-ordering
operation in one Lorentz frame, the &quot;preferred&quot; frame, is not the time-ordering
operation in another frame. However, the characteristic spacelike distance over
which the commutator decays is the particle's Compton wavelength so, since the
commutator rapidly gets quite small, the model is &quot;almost&quot; relativistic. This
&quot;QRCSL&quot; model is completely finite: unlike previous, relativistic, models, it
has no (infinite) energy production from the vacuum state.
  QRCSL calculations are given of the collapse rate for a single free particle
in a superposition of spatially separated packets, and of the energy production
rate for any number of free particles: these reduce to the CSL rates if the
particle's Compton wavelength is small compared to the model's distance
parameter. One motivation for QRCSL is the realization that previous
relativistic models entail excitation of nuclear states which exceeds that of
experiment, whereas QRCSL does not: an example is given involving quadrupole
excitation of the $^{74}$Ge nucleus.

specified n-qubit unitary operation, U, without the use of ancilla qubits? We
show that a lower bound on the minimal size is provided by the length of the
minimal geodesic between U and the identity, I, where length is defined by a
suitable Finsler metric on SU(2^n). The geodesic curves of such a metric have
the striking property that once an initial position and velocity are set, the
remainder of the geodesic is completely determined by a second order
differential equation known as the geodesic equation. This is in contrast with
the usual case in circuit design, either classical or quantum, where being
given part of an optimal circuit does not obviously assist in the design of the
rest of the circuit. Geodesic analysis thus offers a potentially powerful
approach to the problem of proving quantum circuit lower bounds. In this paper
we construct several Finsler metrics whose minimal length geodesics provide
lower bounds on quantum circuit size, and give a procedure to compute the
corresponding geodesic equation. We also construct a large class of solutions
to the geodesic equation, which we call Pauli geodesics, since they arise from
isometries generated by the Pauli group. For any unitary U diagonal in the
computational basis, we show that: (a) provided the minimal length geodesic is
unique, it must be a Pauli geodesic; (b) finding the length of the minimal
Pauli geodesic passing from I to U is equivalent to solving an exponential size
instance of the closest vector in a lattice problem (CVP); and (c) all but a
doubly exponentially small fraction of such unitaries have minimal Pauli
geodesics of exponential length.

suppress the detrimental influence of noise on entanglement; ii) when
self-stimulation becomes effective, a classical model of parametric emission
incorporating noise provides the same results of quantum theory for the

that, in the macroscopic limit, it is impossible to observe violations of local

These results provide an interesting example of the emergence of macroscopic

its canonical form and the adjoint of this canonical form. The
distinguishability of these operators is quantified by the minimum overlap of
the output states over all possible input probe states. The entangling capacity
of the original unitary operator is therefore directly related to the degree of

satisfactory manner in terms of the extent to which it can be distinguished, by

  harmonic oscillators</title><description>  Other than scattering problems where perturbation theory is applicable, there
are basically two ways to solve problems in physics. One is to reduce the
problem to harmonic oscillators, and the other is to formulate the problem in
terms of two-by-two matrices. If two oscillators are coupled, the problem
combines both two-by-two matrices and harmonic oscillators. This method then
becomes a powerful research tool to cover many different branches of physics.
Indeed, the concept and methodology in one branch of physics can be translated
into another through the common mathematical formalism. Coupled oscillators
provide clear illustrative examples for some of the current issues in physics,
including entanglement and Feynman's rest of the universe. In addition, it is
noted that the present form of quantum mechanics is largely a physics of
harmonic oscillators. Special relativity is the physics of the Lorentz group
which can be represented by the group of two-by-two matrices commonly called
$SL(2,c)$. Thus the coupled harmonic oscillators can play the role of combining
quantum mechanics with special relativity. It is therefore possible to relate
the current issues of physics to the Lorentz-covariant formulation of quantum
mechanics.

the free-particle Schrodinger equation in one dimension which exhibit the most
general form of the time-dependent spread in position, namely (Delta x_t)^2 =
(Delta x_0)^2 + At + (Delta p_0)^2t^2/m^2, where A = &lt;(xhat - &lt;xhat&gt;_0)(phat -

position-momentum correlation structure of the initial wave packet. We exhibit
straightforward examples corresponding to squeezed states, as well as
quasi-classical cases, for which A &lt; 0 so that the position spread can (at
least initially) decrease in time because of such correlations. We discuss how
the initial correlations in these examples can be dynamically generated (at
least conceptually) in various bound state systems. Finally, we focus on
providing different ways of visualizing the x-p correlations present in these
cases, including the time-dependent distribution of kinetic energy and the use
of the Wigner quasi-probability distribution. We discuss similar results, both
for the time-dependent Delta x_t and special correlated solutions, for the case
of a particle subject to a uniform force.

($S_r$, $S_k$, $S$) are evaluated for many nuclei using &quot;experimental&quot;
densities or/and momentum distributions. The results are compared with the
harmonic oscillator model and with the short-range correlated distributions. It
is found that $S_r$ depends strongly on $\ln A$ and does not depend very much
on the model. The behaviour of $S_k$ is opposite. The various cases we consider
can be classified according to either the quantity of the experimental data we
use or by the values of $S$, i.e., the increase of the quality of the density
and of the momentum distributions leads to an increase of the values of $S$. In
all cases, apart from the linear relation $S=a+b\ln A$, the linear relation
$S=a_V+b_V \ln V$ also holds. V is the mean volume of the nucleus. If $S$ is
considered as an ensemble entropy, a relation between $A$ or $V$ and the
ensemble volume can be found. Finally, comparing different electron scattering
experiments for the same nucleus, it is found that the larger the momentum
transfer ranges, the larger the information entropy is. It is concluded that
$S$ could be used to compare different experiments for the same nucleus and to
choose the most reliable one.

that classical physics (be it point-like analytic, statistical, or
field-theoretic) accustomed us to consider as valid. In this paper, quantum
nonseparability is viewed as a consequence of the Hilbert-space quantum
mechanical formalism, avoiding thus any direct recourse to the ramifications of
Kochen-Specker's argument or Bell's inequality. Depending on the mode of
assignment of states to physical systems (unit state vectors versus
non-idempotent density operators) we distinguish between strong/relational and
weak/deconstructional forms of quantum nonseparability. The origin of the
latter is traced down and discussed at length, whereas its relation to the all
important concept of potentiality in forming a coherent picture of the puzzling
entangled interconnections among spatially separated systems is also
considered. Finally, certain philosophical consequences of quantum
nonseparability concerning the nature of quantum objects, the question of
realism in quantum mechanics, and possible limitations in revealing the actual
character of physical reality in its entirety are explored.

  Algorithms Seen in Perspective from Network Complexity towards Time
  Complexity</title><description>  In this paper, we demonstrate that optimal control algorithms can be used to
speed up the implementation of modules of quantum algorithms or quantum
simulations in networks of coupled qubits. The gain is most prominent in
realistic cases, where the qubits are not all mutually coupled. Thus the
shortest times obtained depend on the coupling topology as well as on the
characteristicratio of the time scales for local controls {\em vs} non-local
({\em i.e.} coupling) evolutions in the specific experimental setting. Relating
these minimal times to the number of qubits gives the tightest known upper
bounds to the actual time complexity of the quantum modules. As will be shown,
time complexity is a more realistic measure of the experimental cost than the
usual gate complexity.
  In the limit of fast local controls (as {\em e.g.} in NMR), time-optimised
realisations are shown for the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the multiply
controlled {\sc not}-gate ({\sc c$^{n-1}$not}) in various coupling topologies
of $n$ qubits. The speed-ups are substantial: in a chain of six qubits the
quantum Fourier transform so far obtained by optimal control is more than eight
times faster than the standard decomposition into controlled phase, Hadamard

different physical setups in which channels with memory may be operated for the

in which either the receiver or a malicious third party have control of the

these settings, and give several examples to show that they may or may not
coincide. Entropic upper bounds on the various channel capacities are given.
For forgetful quantum channels, in which the effect of the initializing memory
dies out as time increases, coding theorems are presented to show that these

problem for dielectrics is developed. Using well-known many-body techniques we
derive a perturbation expansion for the energy which is free from divergences.
In the continuum limit we turn off the interaction at a distance smaller than a
cut-off distance $a$ to keep the energy finite. We will show that the
macroscopic theory of the Casimir effect with hard boundary conditions is not
well defined because it ignores the finite distance between the atoms, hence is
including infinite self-energy contributions. Nevertheless for disconnected
bodies the latter do not contribute to the force between the bodies. The
Lorentz-Lorenz relation for the dielectric constant that enters the force is
deduced in our microscopic theory without further assumptions.
  The photon Green's function can be calculated from a Dyson type integral
equation. The geometry of the problem only enters in this equation through the
region of integration which is equal to the region occupied by the dielectric.
The integral equation can be solved exactly for various plain and spherical
geometries without using boundary conditions. This clearly shows that the
Casimir force for dielectrics is due to the forces between the atoms.
  Convergence of the perturbation expansion and the metallic limit are

exactly solvable in one dimension, which exhibits a rich structure of quantum
phase transitions (QPTs). The T=0 phase diagram is exactly reproduced by
studying singularities of single-site entanglement. It is shown how comparison
of the latter quantity and quantum mutual information allows one to recognize
whether two-point or shared quantum correlations are responsible for each of
the occurring QPTs. The method works in principle for any number D of degrees

thermodynamic functions of a many-boson system. Explicit expressions are
obtained in the pair correlations approximation for an arbitrary temperature.
The theory is self-consistent in the sence that the calculated properties at
low temperatures coincide with that of Bogoliubov theory and in the
high-temperature limit lead to the results for classical non-ideal gas in the
random phase approximation. The phase transition is also revealed as a
concequence of Bose-Einstein condensation deformed by interatomic interactions.
All the final formulae are written solely via the liquid structure factor taken
as a source information instead of the interatomic potential and, therefore,
interconnect only observable quantities. This gives also a possibility to study
such a strongly non-ideal system as liquid He-4.

a three-photon entangled state, Charlie can then force Alice and Bob to
cooperate to be able to establish the secret key with him by performing proper
polarization measurements on his photon and announcing which polarization basis
he has chosen. In a similar manner, in third-man quantum cryptography (TQC) the
third-man, Charlie, can control whether Alice and Bob can communicate in a
secure way while he has no access whatsoever on the content of the

atom and molecule fields. The crossover from Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC)
to BCS-type superfluidity shows universal features in terms of a concentration
parameter for the ratio between scattering length and average interatomic
distance. We discuss the relevance of the Yukawa coupling between atoms and
molecules, establish an exact narrow resonance limit and show that renormalized

scattering in vacuum and the molecular binding energy. This connects the
universal concentration parameter to the magnetic field of a given experiment.
Beyond mean field theory we include the fluctuations of the molecule field and
the renormalization effects for the atom-molecule coupling. We find excellent
agreement with the observed fraction of bare molecules in fermionic lithium and
qualitative agreement with the condensate fraction in fermionic lithium and
potassium. In addition to the phase diagram and condensate fraction we compute
the correlation length for molecules, the in-medium scattering length for

systems of two fermions in an external field. The treatment is mainly based
upon the recently developed covariant-evolution-operator method for QED
calculations [Lindgren et al. Phys. Rep. 389, 161 (2004)], which has a
structure quite akin to that of many-body perturbation theory. At the same time
this procedure is closely connected to the S-matrix and the Green's-function
formalisms and can therefore serve as a bridge between various approaches. It
is demonstrated that the MBPT-QED scheme, when carried to all orders, leads to
a Schroedinger-like equation, equivalent to the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation. A
Bloch equation in commutator form that can be used for an &quot;extended&quot; or

equation as has the standard Bloch equation to the ordinary Schroedinger
equation and can be used to generate a perturbation expansion compatible with

on a slab in a planar cavity based on the calculation of the vacuum Lorentz
force [C. Raabe and D.-G. Welsch, Phys. Rev. A 71, 013814 (2005)]. We
demonstrate that, according to this formula, the total force on the slab
consists of a medium-screened Casimir force and, in addition to it, a
medium-assisted force. The sign of of the medium-assisted force is determined
solely by the properties of the cavity mirrors. In the Lifshitz configuration,
this force is proportional to 1/d at small distances and is very small compared
with the corresponding van der Waals force. At large distances, however, it is
proportional to 1/d^4 and is comparable with the Casimir force, especially for
denser media. The exponents in these power laws decrease by 1 in the case of a
thin slab. The formula for the medium-assisted force also describes the force
on a layer of the cavity medium, which has similar properties. For dilute
media, it implies an atom-mirror interaction of the Coulomb type at small and
of the Casimir-Polder type at large atom-mirror distances. For a perfectly
reflecting mirror, the latter force is effectively only three-times smaller
than the Casimir-Polder force.

population transfer problem from the first to the second level, minimizing the
time of transfer, with bounded field amplitude. On the Bloch sphere (i.e. after
a suitable Hopf projection), this problem can be attacked with techniques of
optimal syntheses on 2-D manifolds.
  Let $(-E,E)$ be the two energy levels, and $|\Omega(t)|\leq M$ the bound on
the field amplitude. For each values of $E$ and $M$, we provide the explicit
expression of the time optimal trajectory steering the state one to the state
two in terms of a parameter that should be computed numerically.
  For $M&lt;&lt;E$, every time optimal trajectory is periodic (and in particular
bang-bang) with frequency of the order of the resonance frequency
$\omega_R=2E$.
  On the other side, for $M&gt;E$ the time optimal trajectory steering the state
one to the state two is bang-bang with exactly one switching. Fixed $E$ we also
prove that for $M\to\infty$ the time needed to reach the state two tends to
zero.
  Finally we compare these results with some known results of Khaneja, Brockett

to a fixed canonical transformation that is viewed through a moving coordinate
system. The operators that form the bases of the Weyl representation and its
Fourier transform, the chord representation, are, respectively, unitary
reflection and translation operators. Thus, the general semiclassical study of
unitary operators allows us to propagate arbitrary operators, including density
operators, i.e. the Wigner function. The various propagation kernels are
different representations of the superoperators which act on the space of
operators of a closed quantum system. We here present the mixed semiclassical
propagator, that takes translation chords to reflection centres, or vice versa.
In contrast to the centre-centre propagator that directly evolves Wigner
functions, it is guaranteed to be caustic free, having a simple WKB-like
universal form for a finite time, whatever the number of degrees of freedom.
Special attention is given to the near-classical region of small chords, since
this dominates the averages of observables evaluated through the Wigner
function.

Hamiltonian. This paper begins a systematic study of channels defined by
representations; the famous Werner-Holevo channel is one element of this
infinite class. We show that the channel derived from the defining
representation of SU(n) is a depolarizing channel for all $n$, but for most
other representations this is not the case. Since the Bloch sphere is not
appropriate here, we develop technology which is a generalization of Bloch's
technique. Our method works by representing the density matrix as a polynomial
in symmetrized products of Lie algebra generators, with coefficients that are
symmetric tensors. Using these tensor methods we prove eleven theorems, derive
many explicit formulas and show other interesting properties of quantum
channels in various dimensions, with various Lie symmetry algebras. We also
derive numerical estimates on the size of a generalized ``Bloch sphere'' for
certain channels. There remain many open questions which are indicated at

  Andreev reflection</title><description>  A pure spin current injector is proposed based on adiabatic pumping and
crossed normal/Andreev reflection. The device consists of a three-terminal
ferromagnet-superconductor-semiconductor system in which the injection of a
pure spin current is into the semiconductor which is coupled to the
superconductor within a coherence length away from the ferromagnet enabling the
phenomena of crossed normal /Andreev reflection to operate. Quantum pumping is
induced by adiabatically modulating two independent parameters of the
ferromagnetic lead, namely the magnetization strength and the strength of
coupling between the ferromagnet and the superconductor. The competition
between the normal/Andreev reflection and the crossed normal/Andreev
reflection, both induced by pumping, leads to non-local injection of a pure
spin current into the semiconductor. The experimental realization of the
proposed device is also discussed.

can produce interference patterns. These molecules have both rotational and
vibrational degrees of freedom. This leads one to ask whether these internal
motions can play a role in degrading the interference pattern. We study this by
means of a simple model. Our molecule consists of two masses a fixed distance
apart. It scatters from a potential with two or several peaks, thereby
mimicking two or several slit interference. We find that in some parameter
regimes the entanglement between the internal states and the translational
degrees of freedom produced by the potential can decrease the visibility of the
interference pattern. In particular, different internal states correspond to
different outgoing wave vectors, so that if several internal states are
excited, the total interference pattern will be the sum of a number of
patterns, each with a different periodicity. The overall pattern is
consequently smeared out. In the case of two different peaks, the scattering
from the different peaks will excite different internal states so that the path
the molecule takes become entangled with its internal state. This will also
lead to degradation of the interference pattern. How these mechanisms might
lead to the emergence of classical behavior is discussed.

  absorption spectrum</title><description>  We propose a scheme for subwavelength localization of an atom conditioned
upon the absorption of a weak probe field at a particular frequency.
Manipulating atom-field interaction on a certain transition by applying drive
fields on nearby coupled transitions leads to interesting effects in the
absorption spectrum of the weak probe field. We exploit this fact and employ a
four-level system with three driving fields and a weak probe field, where one
of the drive fields is a standing-wave field of a cavity. We show that the
position of an atom along this standing wave is determined when probe field
absorption is measured. We find that absorption of the weak probe field at a
certain frequency leads to subwavelength localization of the atom in either of
the two half-wavelength regions of the cavity field by appropriate choice of
the system parameters. We term this result as sub-half-wavelength localization
to contrast it with the usual atom localization result of four peaks spread
over one wavelength of the standing wave. We observe two localization peaks in
either of the two half-wavelength regions along the cavity axis.

dependence in the response of the atomic medium to a weak probe field can be
introduced. This gives rise to phase dependent susceptibility. By properly
controlling phase and amplitudes of the drive fields we obtain variety of
interesting effects. On one hand we obtain phase control of the group velocity
of a probe field passing through medium to the extent that continuous tuning of
the group velocity from subluminal to superluminal and back is possible. While
on the other hand, by choosing one of the drive fields to be a standing wave
field inside a cavity, we obtain sub-wavelength localization of moving atoms
passing through the cavity field.

through an infinite number of marginally unstable periodic orbits. These orbits
have zero measure, thus not affecting the ergodicity of the chaotic region.
Notwithstanding, they govern the main dynamical properties of the system. In

sufficient conditions for two mixed states to reach these bounds. Moreover we
construct the corresponding optimal measurement strategies. With this result,
we provide analytical solutions for unambiguous discrimination of a class of

some pure state case. Additionally, we show that examples exist where the

  sums</title><description>  Mutually unbiased bases (MUBs), which are such that the inner product between
two vectors in different orthogonal bases is constant equal to the inverse
$1/\sqrt{d}$, with $d$ the dimension of the finite Hilbert space, are becoming
more and more studied for applications such as quantum tomography and
cryptography, and in relation to entangled states and to the Heisenberg-Weil
group of quantum optics. Complete sets of MUBs of cardinality $d+1$ have been
derived for prime power dimensions $d=p^m$ using the tools of abstract algebra
(Wootters in 1989, Klappenecker in 2003). Presumably, for non prime dimensions
the cardinality is much less. The bases can be reinterpreted as quantum phase
states, i.e. as eigenvectors of Hermitean phase operators generalizing those
introduced by Pegg &amp; Barnett in 1989. The MUB states are related to additive
characters of Galois fields (in odd characteristic p) and of Galois rings (in
characteristic 2). Quantum Fourier transforms of the components in vectors of
the bases define a more general class of MUBs with multiplicative characters
and additive ones altogether. We investigate the complementary properties of
the above phase operator with respect to the number operator. We also study the
phase probability distribution and variance for physical states and find them
related to the Gauss sums, which are sums over all elements of the field (or of
the ring) of the product of multiplicative and additive characters. Finally we
relate the concepts of mutual unbiasedness and maximal entanglement. This
allows to use well studied algebraic concepts as efficient tools in our quest
of minimal uncertainty in quantum information primitives.

Most significantly, for an arbitrary initial state, this geometric phase

operator is also addressed, which is elaborated by a pullback U(N)-bundle.

environment of many spins 1/2 with and without mutual coupling. The total
system is closed, its state is pure and evolves under Schroedinger dynamics.
Nevertheless, the considered spin typically reaches a quasi-stationary
equilibrium state. Here we show that this state depends strongly on the
coupling to the environment on the one hand and on the coupling within the
environmental spins on the other. In particular we focus on spin star and spin
ring-star geometries to investigate the effect of intra-environmental coupling
on the central spin. By changing the spectrum of the environment its effect as
a bath on the central spin is changed also and may even be adjustable to some
degree. We find that the relaxation behavior is related to the distribution of
the energy eigenstates of the total system. For each of these relaxation modes

given a quite arbitrary pair of quantum chains, one can check whether it is

that embed a finite-dimensional Hilbert space in the infinite-dimensional
Hilbert space of a system described by continuous quantum variables [D.
Gottesman et al., Phys. Rev. A 64, 012310 (2001)]. The main difficulty of this
continuous variable encoding relies on the physical generation of the quantum
codewords. We show that ponderomotive interaction suffices to this end. As a
matter of fact, this kind of interaction between a system and a meter causes a
frequency change on the meter proportional to the position quadrature of the
system. Then, a phase measurement of the meter leaves the system in an
eigenstate of the stabilizer generators, provided that system and meter's
initial states are suitably prepared. Here we show how to implement this
interaction using trapped ions, and how the encoding can be performed on their
motional degrees of freedom. The robustness of the codewords with respect to
the various experimental imperfections is then analyzed.

particle along any vector is minus the spin of the other particle along the
same vector. It seems that either the choice of vector along which one projects
the spin of the first particle influences at superluminal speed the state of
the second particle, or naive realism holds true i.e., the projections of the
spin of any EPR particle along all the vectors are determined before any
measurement occurs). Naive realism is negated by Bell's theory that originated
and is still most often presented as related to non-locality, a relation whose
necessity has recently been proven to be false. I advocate here that the
solution of the apparent paradox lies in the fact that the spin of the second
particle is determined along any vector, but not along all vectors. Such an
any-all distinction was already present in quantum mechanics, for instance in
the fact that the spin can be measured along any vector but not at once along
all vectors, as a result of the Uncertainty Principle. The time symmetry of the
any-all distinction defended here is in fact reminiscent of (and I claim, due
to) the time symmetry of the Uncertainty Principle described by Einstein,
Tolman, and Podolsky in 1931, in a paper entitled ``Knowledge of Past and
Future in Quantum Mechanics&quot; that is enough to negate naive realism and to hint
at the any-all distinction. A simple classical model is next built, which
captures aspects of the any-all distinction: the goal is of course not to have
a classical exact model, but to provide a caricature that might help some
people.

entanglement. Entanglement manifests itself by producing correlations between
classical events (e.g. the firing of some detectors) at any two space-time
locations. If the locations are time-like separated, i.e. one is in the future
of the other, then there is no specific difficulty to understand the
correlations. But if the two locations are space-like separated, the problem is
different. How can the two space-time locations out there know about what
happens in each other without any sort of communication? If space-time really
exists, the locations must do something like communicating. Or it was all set
up at the Beginning. But the correlations depend also on the free choice of the
experimentalists, one in each space-time location. This allowed John Bell to
derive his inequality and the experimentalists to violate it, thus refuting the
assumption that it was all set up at the beginning: the Correlations can't be
explained by common causes.

We study these distillation protocols depending on whether we use twirling

information gain to an eavesdropper during public announcement of unencrypted

key length. We aim at exploiting the randomness of preparation (measurement)
basis and the bit values encoded (observed), so as to randomize the bases lists

given for our scheme and proven that our protocol results in lesser information
gain by Eve in comparison with BB84 and its other extensions. Moreover, an
analysis is made on the feasibility of our proposal as such and to support
entanglement based QKD. The performance of our protocol is compared in terms of
the upper and lower bounds on the tolerable bit error rate. We also quantify
the information gain (by Eve) mathematically using the familiar approach of the

  Oscillations</title><description>  Feynman's laws of quantum dynamics are concisely stated, discussed in
comparison with other formulations of quantum mechanics and applied to selected
problems in the physical optics of photons and massive particles as well as
flavour oscillations. The classical wave theory of light is derived from these
laws for the case in which temporal variation of path amplitudes may be
neglected, whereas specific experiments, sensitive to the temporal properties
of path amplitudes, are suggested. The reflection coefficient of light from the
surface of a transparent medium is found to be markedly different to that
predicted by the classical Fresnel formula. Except for neutrino oscillations,
good agreement is otherwise found with previous calculations of spatially

  magnetic resonance</title><description>  Geometric phases have stimulated researchers for its potential applications
in many areas of science. One of them is fault-tolerant quantum computation. A
preliminary requisite of quantum computation is the implementation of
controlled logic gates by controlled dynamics of qubits. In controlled
dynamics, one qubit undergoes coherent evolution and acquires appropriate
phase, depending on the state of other qubits. If the evolution is geometric,
then the phase acquired depend only on the geometry of the path executed, and
is robust against certain types of errors. This phenomenon leads to an
inherently fault-tolerant quantum computation.
  Here we suggest a technique of using non-adiabatic geometric phase for
quantum computation, using selective excitation. In a two-qubit system, we
selectively evolve a suitable subsystem where the control qubit is in state
|1&gt;, through a closed circuit. By this evolution, the target qubit gains a
phase controlled by the state of the control qubit. Using these geometric phase
gates we demonstrate implementation of Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and Grover's
search algorithm in a two-qubit system.

cavities have been calculated using the &quot;thin crystal approximation&quot;, i.e.
taking into account the effect of diffraction only inside the empty part of the
cavity, and neglecting its effect in the nonlinear propagation inside the
nonlinear crystal. We introduce in the present paper a theoretical method which
is not restricted by this approximation. It allows us in particular to treat
configurations closer to the actual experimental ones, where the crystal length
is comparable to the Rayleigh length of the cavity mode. We use this method in
the case of the confocal OPO, where the thin crystal approximation predicts
perfect squeezing on any area of the transverse plane, whatever its size and
shape. We find that there exists in this case a &quot;coherence length&quot; which gives
the minimum size of a detector on which perfect squeezing can be observed, and
which gives therefore a limit to the improvement of optical resolution that can
be obtained using such devices.

with the help of Lifshitz formula depending upon permittivity of media. We will
show that this formula is in contradiction with experimental evidence for
excited atoms. We calculate Casimir force between two atoms if one of them or
both atoms are excited. We use methods of quantum electrodynamics specially
derived for the problem. It enables us to take into account excited-state
radiation widths of atoms. Then we calculate the force between excited atom and
medium of ground-state atoms. The results are in agreement with the ones,
obtained by other authors using perturbation theory or linear response theory.
Generalization of our results to the case of interaction between two media of
excited atoms results in a formula, which is in not only in quantitative, but
in qualitative contradiction with Lifshits formula. This contradiction
disappears if media of ground-state atoms are taken. Moreover, our result does
not include permittivity of the media. It includes the quantity which differs
from the permittivity only for excited atoms. The main features of our results
are as follows. The interaction is resonant; the force may be either attractive
or repulsive depending on resonant frequencies of the atoms of different media;
the value of Casimir force may be several orders of magnitude lager than that
predicted by Lifshitz formula. The features mentioned here are in agreement
with known experimental and theoretical evidences obtained by many authors for
interaction of a single excited atom with dielectric media.

Instead, the Lifshitz formula for the Casimir free energy should be

Liouville operator into two contributions, with positive and negative spectrum,
respectively. The unstable negative part is eliminated by a positivity
constraint on physical states, which is invariant under the classical
Hamiltonian flow. In this way, the classical Liouville equation becomes a
functional Schroedinger equation of a genuine quantum field theory. Thus, 't
Hooft's proposal to reconstruct quantum theory as emergent from an underlying

intimately related to the constraint, which selects the part of Hilbert space
where the Hamilton operator is positive. This is seen as dynamical symmetry
breaking in a suitably extended model, depending on a mass scale which
discriminates classical dynamics beneath from emergent quantum mechanical

Relation between an observable and a quantum state is investigated in the

incompatibility between observable and state. On ground of this, an argument is
peresented that leads to a natural quantum measure of coherence, called

particles of arbitrary spin j which transform according to an irreducible
representation of the rotation group. A positive map theta is introduced which
describes the time reversal symmetry of the local states and which is unitarily
equivalent to the transposition of matrices. It is shown that the partial time
reversal transformation theta_2 = (I tensor theta) acting on the composite
system can be expressed in terms of the invariant 6-j symbols introduced by
Wigner into the quantum theory of angular momentum. This fact enables a
complete geometrical construction of the manifold of states with positive
partial transposition and of the sets of separable and entangled states of (4
tensor 4) systems. The separable states are shown to form a three-dimensional
prism and a three-dimensional manifold of bound entangled states is identified.
A positive maps is obtained which yields, together with the time reversal, a
necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of states of (4 tensor

affirmative. We show that hidden subgroups H of the q-hedral groups, i.e.,
semidirect products Z_q \ltimes Z_p where q | (p-1), and in particular the
affine groups A_p, can be information-theoretically reconstructed using the
strong standard method. Moreover, if |H| = p/ \polylog(p), these subgroups can
be fully reconstructed with a polynomial amount of quantum and classical
computation. We show that, for some q, neither the ``forgetful'' abelian method
nor measuring in a random basis succeeds, even information-theoretically. Thus,
at least for some groups, it is crucial to use the full power of representation
theory: namely, to measure the high-dimensional representations in an adapted
basis that respects the group's subgroup structure. We apply our algorithm for
the hidden subgroup problem to new families of cryptographically motivated
Hidden Shift problems, generalizing work of van Dam, Hallgren and Ip on shifts
of multiplicative characters.

loss of the group characteristic related to the time dependence of the

then this vacuum could entail decoherence. This last result will also allow us

Thus when the time of observation T is so brief that T \leq 2 \theta w, where w

It approaches the commutative pattern only when \frac{\theta w}{T} goes to 0.

decrease in the experimental error in the measurement of the absolute

the random and systematic errors, and to find the total experimental error as a
function of separation at the 95% confidence level. In contrast to all previous
experiments on the Casimir effect, our smallest experimental error ($\sim
0.5$%) is achieved over a wide separation range. The theoretical Casimir
pressures in the experimental configuration were calculated by the use of four
theoretical approaches suggested in the literature. All corrections to the
Casimir force were calculated or estimated. All theoretical errors were
analyzed and combined to obtain the total theoretical error at the 95%
confidence level. Finally, the confidence interval for the differences between
theoretical and experimental pressures was obtained as a function of
separation. Our measurements are found to be consistent with two theoretical
approaches utilizing the plasma model and the surface impedance over the entire
measurement region. Two other approaches to the thermal Casimir force,
utilizing the Drude model or a special prescription for the determination of
the zero-frequency contribution to the Lifshitz formula, are excluded on the

Finally, constraints on Yukawa-type hypothetical interactions are strengthened

due to pioneers such as Bayes) were commonly regarded merely as approximations
to a deterministic reality before the roles were reversed by the quantum
revolution (under the leadership of Heisenberg and Dirac) whereby it was the
deterministic description that was reduced to the status of an approximation,
while the role of the observer became particularly prominent. The concomitant
problem of lack of objectivity in the original Copenhagen interpretation has
not been satisfactorily resolved in newer approaches of the kind pioneered by
Everett. The deficiency of such interpretations is attributable to failure to
allow for the anthropic aspect of the problem, meaning {\it a priori}
uncertainty about the identity of the observer. The required reconciliation of
subjectivity with objectivity is achieved here by distinguishing the concept of
an observer from that of a perceptor, whose chances of identification with a
particular observer need to be prescribed by a suitable anthropic principle. It
is proposed that this should be done by an entropy ansatz according to which
the relevant micro-anthropic weighting is taken to be proportional to the
logarithm of the relevant number of Everett type branch-channels.

argue that the conventional reasoning is inadequate: First, it would be more
circumspect to interpret interference breakdown as being due to the
entanglement of the photon with the mirror, not referring to quantum jumps.
Second--and crucial--even in such an interpretation, the reasoning does not
take into account the uncertainty of the mirror momentum. The effect of the
entanglement and interference breakdown would take place if the uncertainty
were much less than the recoil momentum, which is of the order of the photon
momentum. However, an examination leads to the conclusion that for an actual
mirror the opposite situation occurs. Thus there should be no such effect.

  Problem in the Heisenberg Group</title><description>  The hidden subgroup problem (HSP) provides a unified framework to study
problems of group-theoretical nature in quantum computing such as order finding
and the discrete logarithm problem. While it is known that Fourier sampling
provides an efficient solution in the abelian case, not much is known for
general non-abelian groups. Recently, some authors raised the question as to
whether post-processing the Fourier spectrum by measuring in a random
orthonormal basis helps for solving the HSP. Several negative results on the
shortcomings of this random strong method are known. In this paper however, we
show that the random strong method can be quite powerful under certain
conditions on the group G. We define a parameter r(G) for a group G and show
that O((\log |G| / r(G))^2) iterations of the random strong method give enough
classical information to identify a hidden subgroup in G. We illustrate the
power of the random strong method via a concrete example of the HSP over finite
Heisenberg groups. We show that r(G) = \Omega(1) for these groups; hence the
HSP can be solved using polynomially many random strong Fourier samplings
followed by a possibly exponential classical post-processing without further
queries. The quantum part of our algorithm consists of a polynomial computation
followed by measuring in a random orthonormal basis. This gives the first
example of a group where random representation bases do help in solving the HSP
and for which no explicit representation bases are known that solve the problem
with (\log G)^O(1) Fourier samplings. As an interesting by-product of our work,
we get an algorithm for solving the state identification problem for a set of
nearly orthogonal pure quantum states.

We define
non-integrable quantum systems as those which have, as their classical limit, a

self-induced decoherence approach and the corresponding classical limit are
generalized from integrable to non-integrable systems. In this approach, the
lost of information, usually conceived as the result of a coarse-graining or
the trace of an environment, is produced by a particular choice of the algebra
of observables and the systematic use of mean values, that project the unitary
evolution onto an effective non-unitary one. The decoherence times computed
with this approach coincide with those of the literature. By means of our

the black hole. The gravitational field around the black hole thus acts like a

  transpose criterion and others</title><description>  We study entanglement in mixed bipartite quantum states which are invariant
under simultaneous SU(2) transformations in both subsystems. Previous results
on the behavior of such states under partial transposition are substantially
extended. The spectrum of the partial transpose of a given SU(2)-invariant
density matrix $\rho$ is entirely determined by the diagonal elements of $\rho$
in a basis of tensor-product states of both spins with respect to a common
quantization axis. We construct a set of operators which act as entanglement
witnesses on SU(2)-invariant states. A sufficient criterion for $\rho$ having a
negative partial transpose is derived in terms of a simple spin correlator. The
same condition is a necessary criterion for the partial transpose to have the
maximum number of negative eigenvalues. Moreover, we derive a series of sum
rules which uniquely determine the eigenvalues of the partial transpose in
terms of a system of linear equations. Finally we compare our findings with
other entanglement criteria including the reduction criterion, the majorization
criterion, and the recently proposed local uncertainty relations.

nonphysical time evolutions characterized by negative values of the density

Therefore nonphysical situations may not show up in the characteristic

gates which process qubits. The one-way quantum computer proposed by
Raussendorf and Briegel is entirely different. It has changed our understanding
of the requirements for quantum computation and more generally how we think
about quantum physics. This new model requires qubits to be initialized in a
highly-entangled cluster state. From this point, the quantum computation
proceeds by a sequence of single-qubit measurements with classical feedforward
of their outcomes. Because of the essential role of measurement a one-way
quantum computer is irreversible. In the one-way quantum computer the order and
choices of measurements determine the algorithm computed. We have
experimentally realized four-qubit cluster states encoded into the polarization
state of four photons. We fully characterize the quantum state by implementing
the first experimental four-qubit quantum state tomography. Using this cluster
state we demonstrate the feasibility of one-way quantum computing through a
universal set of one- and two-qubit operations. Finally, our implementation of
Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that one-way quantum computation is
ideally suited for such tasks.

  criteria</title><description>  The so-called permutation separability criteria are simple operational
conditions that are necessary for separability of mixed states of multipartite
systems: (1) permute the indices of the density matrix and (2) check if the
trace norm of at least one of the resulting operators is greater than one. If
it is greater than one then the state is necessarily entangled. A shortcoming
of the permutation separability criteria is that many permutations give rise to
dependent separability criteria. Therefore, we introduce a necessary condition
for two permutations to yield independent criteria called combinatorical
independence. This condition basically means that the map corresponding to one
permutation cannot be obtained by concatenating the map corresponding to the
second permutation with a norm-preserving map. We characterize completely
combinatorically independent criteria, and determine simple permutations that
represent all independent criteria. The representatives can be visualized by
means of a simple graphical notation. They are composed of three basic
operations: partial transpose, and two types of so-called reshufflings. In
particular, for a four-partite system all criteria except one are composed of
partial transpose and only one type of reshuffling; the exceptional one
requires the second type of reshuffling. Furthermore, we show how to obtain
efficiently for every permutation a simple representative. This method allows
to check easily if two permutations are combinatorically equivalent or not.

upper bound for the concurrence of assistance. We consider dynamics of spin-1/2
systems that model qubits, with different couplings and possible presence of
magnetic field to investigate the appearance of the discussed entanglement
properties. We find that states with maximal bipartite entanglement can be

states with high concurrence of assistance with suitably chosen initial state.
We show that the production of graph states using the Ising Hamiltonian is
controllable via a single-qubit rotation of one spin-1/2 subsystem in the
initial multi-qubit state. We shown that the property of Ising dynamics to
convert a product state basis into a special maximally entangled basis is
temporally enhanced by the application of a suitable magnetic field. Similar

no code of length n can fix more than n/4 arbitrary errors, regardless of the
dimension of the coding and encoded Hilbert spaces. However, this bound only
applies to codes which recover the message exactly. Naively, one might expect
that correcting errors to very high fidelity would only allow small violations
of this bound. This intuition is incorrect: in this paper we describe quantum
error-correcting codes capable of correcting up to (n-1)/2 arbitrary errors
with fidelity exponentially close to 1, at the price of increasing the size of
the registers (i.e., the coding alphabet). This demonstrates a sharp
distinction between exact and approximate quantum error correction. The codes
have the property that any $t$ components reveal no information about the
message, and so they can also be viewed as error-tolerant secret sharing
schemes.
  The construction has several interesting implications for cryptography and
quantum information theory. First, it suggests that secret sharing is a better
classical analogue to quantum error correction than is classical error
correction. Second, it highlights an error in a purported proof that verifiable
quantum secret sharing (VQSS) is impossible when the number of cheaters t is
n/4. More generally, the construction illustrates a difference between exact
and approximate requirements in quantum cryptography and (yet again) the
delicacy of security proofs and impossibility results in the quantum model.

point \vec{q}(k) in the three-dimensional momentum space and \vec{q}(k) makes a
planar orbit as k changes its value in [-\pi, \pi). The integration over k
providing the real-space wave function for a quantum walker corresponds to
considering an orbital state of a Weyl particle, which is defined as a
superposition (curvilinear integration) of the energy-momentum eigenstates of a
free Weyl equation along the orbit. Konno's novel distribution function of
quantum-walker's pseudo-velocities in the long-time limit is fully controlled
by the shape of the orbit and how the orbit is embedded in the
three-dimensional momentum space. The family of orbital states can be regarded

one-dimensional system between the degrees of freedom in an interval of length
l and its complement, starting from a pure state which is not an eigenstate of
the hamiltonian. We use path integral methods of quantum field theory as well
as explicit computations for the transverse Ising spin chain. In both cases,
there is a maximum speed v of propagation of signals. In general the
entanglement entropy increases linearly with time $t$ up to t=l/2v, after which
it saturates at a value proportional to l, the coefficient depending on the
initial state. This behavior may be understood as a consequence of causality.

out here the prominent role played by Galois fields viewed as cyclotomic
extensions of the integers modulo a prime characteristic $p$. They can be used
to generate efficient cyclic encoding, for transmitting secrete quantum keys,
for quantum state recovery and for error correction in quantum computing.
Finite projective planes and their generalization are the geometric counterpart
to cyclotomic concepts, their coordinatization involves Galois fields, and they
have been used repetitively for enciphering and coding. Finally the characters
over Galois fields are fundamental for generating complete sets of mutually
unbiased bases, a generic concept of quantum information processing and quantum
entanglement. Gauss sums over Galois fields ensure minimum uncertainty under
such protocols. Some Galois rings which are cyclotomic extensions of the
integers modulo 4 are also becoming fashionable for their role in time encoding

presented. The protocol is an improvement over the BB84 QKD protocol. BB84, in
conjunction with the one-time pad algorithm, has been shown to be
unconditionally secure. However it suffers from two drawbacks: (1) Its security
relies on the assumption that Alice's qubit source is perfect in the sense that
it does not inadvertently emit multiple copies of the same qubit. A multi-qubit
emission attack can be launched if this assumption is violated. (2) BB84 cannot
transfer predetermined keys; the keys it can distribute are generated in the

  As in BB84, our protocol requires an authenticated public channel so as to
detect an intruder's interaction with the quantum channel, but unlike in
symmetric-key cryptography, the confidentiality of transmitted data does not
rely on a shared secret key.

dot-molecules, we show how simpler, popularly-practiced approximations, depict
the basic physical characteristics including the singlet-triplet splitting,
degree of entanglement (DOE) and correlation. The mean-field-like
single-configuration approaches such as Hartree-Fock and local spin density,
lacking correlation, incorrectly identify the ground state symmetry and give
inaccurate values for the singlet-triplet splitting and the DOE. The Hubbard
model gives qualitatively correct results for the ground state symmetry and
singlet-triplet splitting, but produces significant errors in the DOE because
it ignores the fact that the strain is asymmetric even if the dots within a

correct ground state symmetry and singlet-triplet splitting only for rather
large inter-dot separations, but it greatly overestimates the DOE as a

  Localization</title><description>  Quantum parallelism implies a spread of information over the space in
contradistinction to the classical mechanical situation where the information
is &quot;centered&quot; on a fixed trajectory of a classical particle. This means that a
quantum state becomes specified by more indefinite data. The above spread
resembles, without being an exact analogy, a transfer of energy to smaller and
smaller scales observed in the hydrodynamical turbulence. There, in spite of
the presence of dissipation (in a form of kinematic viscosity), energy is still
conserved. The analogy with the information spread in classical to quantum
transition means that in this process the information is also conserved. To
illustrate that, we show (using as an example a specific case of a coherent
quantum oscillator) how the Shannon information density continuously changes in
the above transition . In a more general scheme of things, such an analogy
allows us to introduce a &quot;dissipative&quot; term (connected with the information
spread) in the Hamilton-Jacobi equation and arrive in an elementary fashion at
the equations of classical quantum mechanics (ranging from the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger
to Klein-Gordon equations). We also show that the principle of least action in
quantum mechanics is actually the requirement for the energy to be bounded from
below.

186 (1998)] that the chaotic tumbling of the satellite Hyperion would become
non-classical within 20 years, but for the effects of environmental
decoherence. The dynamics of quantum and classical probability distributions
are compared for a satellite rotating perpendicular to its orbital plane,
driven by the gravitational gradient. The model is studied with and without
environmental decoherence. Without decoherence, the maximum quantum-classical
(QC) differences in its average angular momentum scale as hbar^{2/3} for
chaotic states, and as hbar^2 for non-chaotic states, leading to negligible QC
differences for a macroscopic object like Hyperion. The quantum probability
distributions do not approach their classical limit smoothly, having an
extremely fine oscillatory structure superimposed on the smooth classical
background. For a macroscopic object, this oscillatory structure is too fine to
be resolved by any realistic measurement. Either a small amount of smoothing
(due to the finite resolution of the apparatus) or a very small amount of
environmental decoherence is sufficient ensure the classical limit. Under
decoherence, the QC differences in the probability distributions scale as
(hbar^2/D)^{1/6}, where D is the momentum diffusion parameter. We conclude that
decoherence is not essential to explain the classical behavior of macroscopic
bodies.

rapid development during the last few years. Initial motivation for playing
games, in the quantum world, comes from the possibility of re-formulating
quantum communication protocols, and algorithms, in terms of games between
quantum and classical players. The possibility led to the view that quantum
games have a potential to provide helpful insight into working of quantum
algorithms, and even in finding new ones. This thesis analyzes and compares
some interesting games when played classically and quantum mechanically. A
large part of the thesis concerns investigations into a refinement notion of
the Nash equilibrium concept. The refinement, called an evolutionarily stable
strategy (ESS), was originally introduced in 1970s by mathematical biologists
to model an evolving population using techniques borrowed from game theory.
Analysis is developed around a situation when quantization changes ESSs without
affecting corresponding Nash equilibria. Effects of quantization on
solution-concepts other than Nash equilibrium are presented and discussed. For
this purpose the notions of value of coalition, backwards-induction outcome,
and subgame-perfect outcome are selected. Repeated games are known to have
different information structure than one-shot games. Investigation is presented
into a possible way where quantization changes the outcome of a repeated game.
Lastly, two new suggestions are put forward to play quantum versions of
classical matrix games. The first one uses the association of De Broglie's
waves, with travelling material objects, as a resource for playing a quantum
game. The second suggestion concerns an EPR type setting exploiting directly
the correlations in Bell's inequalities to play a bi-matrix game.

the parties, in comparison with quantum teleportation using the same strength
of entanglement. Depending on the amount of information destroyed in the
measurement, this protocol may be regarded as a teleportation protocol
(complete destruction of input state), or as a $1\to M$ cloning protocol
(partial destruction), or as a direct transmission (no destruction). This
scheme can be straightforwardly implemented with the experimentally accessible
setup at present.

(quantum-phase-like transitions). These transitions are characterized by abrupt
changes of the bi-partite entanglement between atoms at critical values
$\kappa_j$ of the atom-field coupling parameter $\kappa$ and are accompanied by
discontinuities of the first derivative of the energy of the ground state. We
show that in a weak-coupling limit ($\kappa_1\leq \kappa \leq \kappa_2$) the
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequalities are saturated which proves that for
these values of the coupling no intrinsic multipartite entanglement (neither
among the atoms nor between the atoms and the field) is generated by the
atom-field interaction. We analyze also the atom-field entanglement and we show
that in the strong-coupling limit the field is entangled with the atoms so that
the von Neumann entropy of the atomic sample (that serves as a measure of the
atom-field entanglement) takes the value $S_A={1/2}\ln (N+1)$. The entangling
interaction with atoms leads to a highly sub-Poissonian photon statistics of
the field mode.

arbitrary shape and duration, the drive frequency can be analytically optimized
to maximize the amplitude of the population oscillations between the selected
two levels in a general many level quantum system. It was shown how the
standard Rabi theory can be extended beyond the simple two-level systems. Now,
in order to achieve the quickest and as complete as possible population
transfer between two pre-selected levels, driving pulse should be tailored so
that it produces only a single half-oscillation of the population. In this
paper, this second (and final) step towards the controlled population transfer
using modified (i.e. many level system) Rabi oscillations is discussed. The
results presented herein can be regarded as an extension of the standard

feature of these experiments is the use of a gating system to produce near

behaviour (in two mutually exclusive experiments) they claim to have
demonstrated the dual particle-wave behaviour of light and hence to have
confirmed Bohr's principle of complementarity. The demonstration of the wave
behaviour of light is not in dispute. But we want to demonstrate, contrary to
the claims of GRA, that their beam-splitter experiment does not conclusively
confirm the particle behaviour of light, and hence does not confirm
particle-wave duality, nor, more generally, does it confirm complementarity.
Our demonstration consists of providing a detailed model based on the Causal
Interpretation of Quantum Fields (CIEM), which does not involve the particle
concept, of GRA's which-path experiment. We will also give a brief outline of a

set of states, multi-dimensional entangled coherent states. Those states
possess an arbitrarily large amount of entanglement $E$ provided the number of
photons is at least of order $2^{2E}$. We calculate how fast that entanglement
decays due to photon absorption losses and how much entanglement is left. We
find that for very small losses the amount of entanglement lost is equal to
$2/\log(2)\approx 2.89$ ebits per absorbed photon, irrespective of the amount
of pure-state entanglement $E$ one started with. In contrast, for larger losses
it tends to be the remaining amount of entanglement that is independent of $E$.
This may provide a useful strategy for creating states with a fixed amount of

the relation between this measure and a number of other measures used for that

upper bounds on the relative entropy in terms of various distance measures for
the difference of the states based on unitarily invariant norms. The upper
bounds can be considered as statements of continuity of the relative entropy
distance in the sense of Fannes. We employ methods from optimisation theory to
obtain bounds that are as sharp as possible.

law is violated for Fermions. The relation between the entanglement entropy and
the structure of the Fermi surface is discussed, and it is proven, that the
presented scaling law holds whenever the Fermi surface is finite. This is in

played by the filtering equation, which recursively updates the information
state of the system under observation. Unfortunately, the theory is plagued by
infinite-dimensionality of the information state which severely limits its
practical applicability, except in a few select cases (e.g. the linear Gaussian
case.) One solution proposed in classical filtering theory is that of the
projection filter. In this scheme, the filter is constrained to evolve in a
finite-dimensional family of densities through orthogonal projection on the
tangent space with respect to the Fisher metric. Here we apply this approach to
the simple but highly nonlinear quantum model of optical phase bistability of a
stongly coupled two-level atom in an optical cavity. We observe near-optimal
performance of the quantum projection filter, demonstrating the utility of such
an approach.

  mechanics</title><description>  We derive essential elements of quantum mechanics from a parametric structure
extending that of traditional mathematical statistics. The basic setting is a
set $\mathcal{A}$ of incompatible experiments, and a transformation group $G$
on the cartesian product $\Pi$ of the parameter spaces of these experiments.
The set of possible parameters is constrained to lie in a subspace of $\Pi$, an
orbit or a set of orbits of $G$. Each possible model is then connected to a
parametric Hilbert space. The spaces of different experiments are linked
unitarily, thus defining a common Hilbert space $\mathbf{H}$. A state is
equivalent to a question together with an answer: the choice of an experiment
$a\in\mathcal{A}$ plus a value for the corresponding parameter. Finally,
probabilities are introduced through Born's formula, which is derived from a
recent version of Gleason's theorem. This then leads to the usual formalism of
elementary quantum mechanics in important special cases. The theory is
illustrated by the example of a quantum particle with spin.

  should be non-linear-</title><description>  If there exists a formulation of quantum mechanics which does not refer to a
background classical spacetime manifold, it then follows as a consequence,
(upon making one plausible assumption), that a quantum description of gravity
should be necessarily non-linear. This is true independent of the mathematical
structure used for describing such a formulation of quantum mechanics. A
specific model which exhibits this non-linearity is constructed, using the
language of noncommutative geometry. We derive a non-linear Schrodinger
equation for the quantum dynamics of a particle; this equation reduces to the
standard linear Schrodinger equation when the mass of the particle is much
smaller than Planck mass. It turns out that the non-linear equation found by us
is very similar to a non-linear Schrodinger equation found by Doebner and
Goldin in 1992 from considerations of unitary representaions of the
infinite-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms in three spatial dimensions. Our
analysis suggests that the diffusion constant introduced by Doebner and Goldin
depends on the mass of the particle, and that this constant tends to zero in
the limit in which the particle mass is much smaller than Planck mass, so that
in this limit the non-linear theory reduces to standard linear quantum
mechanics. A similar effective non-linear Schrodinger equation was also found
for the quantum dynamics of a system of D0-branes, by Mavromatos and Szabo.

quantum states when the dimension of the state space grows to infinity. This
has been studied recently for qubits; here we consider larger particles and
conclude that, in all cases, the proportion of the states that are separable is
super-exponentially small in the dimension of the set. We also show that the
partial transpose criterion becomes imprecise when the dimension increases, and
that the lower bound $6^{-N/2}$ on the (Hilbert-Schmidt) inradius of the set of
separable states on N qubits obtained recently by Gurvits and Barnum is
essentially optimal. We employ standard tools of classical convexity,
high-dimensional probability and geometry of Banach spaces. One relatively

weak values and posterior expectation values of classical dynamical properties
according to the classical inference framework.

of the nonlocality of a single photon whose wave function is multi-branched.
The difference between this experiment and others similar, is that the
tester-particle used by Sciarrino to &quot;feel&quot; this nonlocality is another photon
identical to the tested one. Such an experiment be can in principle performed
with fermions too, and this is the case ivestigated in this article. The novel
phenomenon revealed by Sciarrino's experiment, is the particle &quot;borrowing&quot;. If
a single particle is described by a two-branched wave function, then only one
of these branches produces a detection at a time, the other ranch remains
&quot;silent&quot;. What happens in this experiment is that the silent branch &quot;borrows&quot; a
particle from another source, if available in the neighborhood, and also
produces a detection. To illustrate this feature more obviously, a modificaton
of Sciarrino's experiment is proposed. Two sources of particles are made
available in the neighborhood of the two branches. What then happens is that
each branch takes and populates itself with a particle from whichever source is
at hand.

desirable for the future applications in quantum computing, communications and
control. It is also interesting for the modern theoretical research in the
quantum information science and raises challenging questions about an
experimental assessment of such a programmable models. Together with some
progress in the given direction, such ideas encounter specific problems arising
from the very essence of quantum laws. Currently are known two different ways
to overcome such problems, sometime denoted as a stochastic and deterministic
approach. The presented paper is devoted to the second one, that is also may be
called the programmable quantum networks with pure states.
  In the paper are discussed basic principles and theoretical models that can
be used for the design of such nano-devices, e.g., the conditional quantum
dynamics, the Nielsen-Chuang &quot;no-programming theorem, the idea of deterministic
and stochastic quantum gates arrays. Both programmable quantum networks with
finite registers and hybrid models with continuous quantum variables are
considered. As a basic model for the universal programmable quantum network
with pure states and finite program register is chosen a &quot;Control-Shift&quot;
quantum processor architecture with three buses introduced in earlier works. It
is shown also, that quantum cellular automata approach to the construction of
an universal programmable quantum computer often may be considered as the

that zero-dimensional quantum codes can be represented as self-dual additive
codes over GF(4) and also as graphs. We show that graphs representing several
such codes with high minimum distance can be described as nested regular graphs
having minimum regular vertex degree and containing long cycles. Two graphs
correspond to equivalent quantum codes if they are related by a sequence of
local complementations. We use this operation to generate orbits of graphs, and
thus classify all inequivalent self-dual additive codes over GF(4) of length up
to 12, where previously only all codes of length up to 9 were known. We show
that these codes can be interpreted as quadratic Boolean functions, and we
define non-quadratic quantum codes, corresponding to Boolean functions of
higher degree. We look at various cryptographic properties of Boolean
functions, in particular the propagation criteria. The new aperiodic
propagation criterion (APC) and the APC distance are then defined. We show that
the distance of a zero-dimensional quantum code is equal to the APC distance of
the corresponding Boolean function. Orbits of Boolean functions with respect to
the {I,H,N}^n transform set are generated. We also study the peak-to-average
power ratio with respect to the {I,H,N}^n transform set (PAR_IHN), and prove
that PAR_IHN of a quadratic Boolean function is related to the size of the
maximum independent set over the corresponding orbit of graphs. A construction
technique for non-quadratic Boolean functions with low PAR_IHN is proposed. It
is finally shown that both PAR_IHN and APC distance can be interpreted as
partial entanglement measures.

cannot access results in our description of the system becoming mixed even if
we have perfect initial knowledge. That is, if the system is quantum the
conditional state will be given by a state matrix $\rho_r(t)$ and if classical
the conditional state will be given by a probability distribution $P_r(x,t)$
where $r$ is the result of the measurement. Thus to determine the evolution of
this conditional state under continuous-in-time monitoring requires an
expensive numerical calculation. In this paper we demonstrating a numerical

Furthermore we show that our method can be applied to joint classical and

characterized by a universal exponential rate of fidelity loss. In all cases
the measurable fidelity decrease is directly related to the strength of the

notoriously hard to construct and despite some success of constructing them
numerically, there is no analytic construction known. We present two

from uniformity of the inner products is allowed. The first construction is
based on selecting vectors from a maximal collection of mutually unbiased bases

strongly confined 1D optical lattice using the parameters of the recent
experiment [Fertig et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 220402 (2005)]. We find that,
due to momentum uncertainty, a small, but non-negligible, atom population
occupies the unstable velocity region of the corresponding classical dynamics,
resulting in the observed dissipative atom transport. This population is
generated even in a static vapor, due to quantum fluctuations which are
enhanced by the lattice and the confinement, and is not notably affected by the
motion of atoms or finite temperature.

states with principal quantum numbers n &lt;= 200. While, in principle, the
calculation of the Bethe logarithm is a rather easy computational problem
involving only the nonrelativistic (Schroedinger) theory of the hydrogen atom,
certain calculational difficulties affect highly excited states, and in
particular states for which the principal quantum number is much larger than
the orbital angular momentum quantum number. Two evaluation methods are
contrasted. One of these is based on the calculation of the principal value of
a specific integral over a virtual photon energy. The other method relies
directly on the spectral representation of the Schroedinger-Coulomb propagator.
Selected numerical results are presented. The full set of values is available

quantum protocols. Quantum protocols are novel communication schemes involving
the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena for representation, storage and
transmission of data. As opposed to quantum computers, quantum communication
systems can and have been implemented using present-day technology; therefore,
the ability to model and analyse such systems rigorously is of primary
importance.
  While current analyses of quantum protocols use a traditional mathematical
approach and require considerable understanding of the underlying physics, we
argue that automated verification techniques provide an elegant alternative. We
demonstrate these techniques through the use of PRISM, a probabilistic
model-checking tool. Our approach is conceptually simpler than existing proofs,
and allows us to disambiguate protocol definitions and assess their properties.
It also facilitates detailed analyses of actual implemented systems. We
illustrate our techniques by modelling a selection of quantum protocols (namely
superdense coding, quantum teleportation, and quantum error correction) and
verifying their basic correctness properties. Our results provide a foundation
for further work on modelling and analysing larger systems such as those used
for quantum cryptography, in which basic protocols are used as components.

logic will hit a scaling limit beyond 2016, and that the increased power
dissipation is a major limiting factor. Reversible computing can potentially
require arbitrarily small amounts of energy. Recently several nano-scale
devices which have the potential to scale, and which naturally perform
reversible logic, have emerged. This paper addresses several fundamental issues
that need to be addressed before any nano-scale reversible computing systems
can be realized, including reliability and performance trade-offs and
architecture optimization. Many nano-scale devices will be limited to only near
neighbor interactions, requiring careful optimization of circuits. We provide
efficient fault-tolerant (FT) circuits when restricted to both 2D and 1D.
Finally, we compute bounds on the entropy (and hence, heat) generated by our FT
circuits and provide quantitative estimates on how large can we make our
circuits before we lose any advantage over irreversible computing.

On one hand, this is due
to the fact that, like in classical physics, any realistic system is subjected
to a coupling to an uncontrollable environment which influences it in a
non-negligible way. The theory of open quantum systems thus plays a major role
in many applications of quantum physics since perfect isolation of quantum
system is not possible and since a complete microscopic description or control
of the environment degrees of freedom is not feasible or only partially so&quot;

close physical and mathematical connection between the evolution of an open
system, the state changes induced by quantum measurements, and the classical
notion of a stochastic process. The paper provides a bibliographic review of
this interrelations, it shows the mathematical equivalence between markovian
master equation and generalized piecewise deterministic processes [1] and it

conjugation of the density matrix), for some restricted set of states it can be
achieved unitarily, typically when there is a common de-phasing in a n-level
system. However, in the presence of multiple phases (i. e. a different
de-phasing for each element of an orthogonal basis occurs) the time reversal is
no longer physically possible. In this paper we derive the channel which
optimally approaches in fidelity the time-reversal of multi-phase equatorial
states in arbitrary (finite) dimension. We show that, in contrast to the
customary case of the Universal-NOT on qubits (or the universal conjugation in
arbitrary dimension), the optimal phase covariant time-reversal for equatorial
states is a nonclassical channel, which cannot be achieved via a
measurement/preparation procedure. Unitary realizations of the optimal
time-reversal channel are given with minimal ancillary dimension, exploiting

dephasing on short time scales, exponential decay of coherence appears in the
Markovian limit (for long times) if anharmonicity of the reservoir is taken
into account. This effect not only qualitatively changes the decoherence

spatially separated states dephase with a rate that depends on the distance

measurements are possible for all variables. It is shown that this is correct
also in the framework of the time-symmetric quantum formalism, i.e. nonlocal
variables of composite quantum systems with quantum states evolving both
forward and backward in time are measurable in a demolition way. The result
follows from the possibility to reverse with certainty the time direction of a

evolving quantum states require remarkably small resources. This is so because
the combined operation of time reversal and teleportation of a local backward

several recent quantum algorithms. Here we use numerical simulations to study
the properties of discrete, coined quantum walks. We investigate the variation
in the entanglement between the coin and the position of the particle by
calculating the entropy of the reduced density matrix of the coin. We consider
both dynamical evolution and asymptotic limits for coins of dimensions from two
to eight on regular graphs. For low coin dimensions, quantum walks which spread
faster (as measured by the mean square deviation of their distribution from
uniform) also exhibit faster convergence towards the asymptotic value of the
entanglement between the coin and particle's position. For high-dimensional
coins, the DFT coin operator is more efficient at spreading than the Grover
coin. We study the entanglement of the coin on regular finite graphs such as
cycles, and also show that on complete bipartite graphs, a quantum walk with a
Grover coin is always periodic with period four. We generalize the 'glued
trees' graph used by Childs et al (2003 Proc. STOC, pp 5968) to higher
branching rate (fan out) and verify that the scaling with branching rate and

using a perturbative method. We assume that each two-state system (qubit) that
belongs to a register suffers a phase flip error (\sigma_{z} error) with
probability p independently at every step in the algorithm, where $0\leq p\leq
1$. Considering an n-qubit density operator to which Grover's iterative
operation is applied M times, we expand it in powers of 2Mnp and derive its
matrix element order by order under the large-n limit. [In this large-n limit,
we assume p is small enough, so that 2Mnp can take any real positive value or
zero. We regard $x\equiv 2Mnp(\geq 0)$ as a perturbative parameter.] We obtain
recurrence relations between terms in the perturbative expansion. By these
relations, we compute higher orders of the perturbation efficiently, so that we
extend the range of the perturbative parameter that provides a reliable
analysis. Calculating the matrix element numerically by this method, we derive
the maximum value of the perturbative parameter x at which the algorithm finds
a correct item with a given threshold of probability P_{th} or more. (We refer
to this maximum value of x as x_{c}, a critical point of x.) We obtain a curve
of x_{c} as a function of P_{th} by repeating this numerical calculation for
many points of P_{th} and find the following facts: a tangent of the obtained
curve at P_{th}=1 is given by x=(8/5)(1-P_{th}), and we have

the abandonment of the mentioned interpretation. So the primitive uncertainty
relations appear as being either thought fictions or fluctuations formulae.
Subsequently we reveal that the conventional approaches of quantum measurements

the quantum observables are considered as generalized stochastic variables,
(ii) the view is focused only on the pre-existent state of the measured system,
without any interest for the collapse of the respective state, (iii) a
measurement is described as an input-output transformation which modify the
probability density and current but preserve the expressions of the operators.
The measuring uncertainties are evaluated as changes in the probabilistic
estimators of observables. Related to different observables we do not find
reasons of principle neither for uncertainties-connections nor for measuring
compatibility/incompatibility.

an electromagnetic field. The two pseudosuperpartners and pseudosupersymmetry
generators close a quadratic pseudosuperalgebra. A class of time dependent
electric fields for which the equation of motion for a two level system placed

observed. There exists such a time-dependent detuning of the field frequency
from the resonance value that the probability to populate the excited level
ceases to oscillate and becomes a monotonically growing function of time
tending to 3/4. It is shown that near this fixed excitation regime the
probability exhibits two kinds of oscillations. The oscillations with a small
amplitude and a frequency close to the Rabi frequency (fast oscillations) take
place at the background of the ones with a big amplitude and a small frequency
(slow oscillations). During the period of slow oscillations the minimal value
of the probability to populate the excited level may exceed 1/2 suggesting for

-- upon the undertaking of this study are papers of Zyczkowski and
Slomczy\'nski (J. Phys. A 34, 6689 [2001]) and of Petz and Sudar (J. Math.
Phys. 37, 2262 [1996]). In the former work, a metric (the Monge one,
specifically) over generalized Husimi distributions was employed to define a
distance between two arbitrary density matrices. In the Petz-Sudar work
(completing a program of Chentsov), the quantum analogue of the (classically
unique) Fisher information (montone) metric of a probability simplex was
extended to define an uncountable infinitude of Riemannian (also monotone)
metrics on the set of positive definite density matrices. We pose here the
questions of what is the specific/unique Fisher information metric for the
(classically-defined) Husimi distributions and how does it relate to the
infinitude of (quantum) metrics over the density matrices of Petz and Sudar? We
find a highly proximate (small relative entropy) relationship between the
probability distribution (the quantum Jeffreys' prior) that yields quantum
universal data compression, and that which (following Clarke and Barron) gives
its classical counterpart. We also investigate the Fisher information metrics
corresponding to the escort Husimi, positive-P and certain Gaussian probability
distributions, as well as, in some sense, the discrete Wigner
pseudoprobability. The comparative noninformativity of prior probability
distributions -- recently studied by Srednicki (Phys. Rev. A 71, 052107 [2005])
-- formed by normalizing the volume elements of the various information
metrics, is also discussed in our context.

to be equispaced. However, as it has already been shown in some specific
examples, this property is not always true. To gain some general insight into
this problem, a WKB analysis of the spectrum, valid for any analytic potential,
is performed and the first semiclassical corrections to its regular spacing are
calculated. We illustrate the results on the two-parameter family of

the asymmetric parabolic well, the radial harmonic oscillator and Urabe's

any $i_1,...,i_k \in \{1,...,2^n\}$, the values of the bits
$a_{i_1},...,a_{i_k}$ can be retrieved from $|\Psi&gt;$ by a one-round
Arthur-Merlin interactive protocol of size polynomial in $n$. This shows how to
go around Holevo-Nayak's Theorem, using Arthur-Merlin proofs.
  We use the new representation to prove the following results:
  1) Interactive proofs with quantum advice: We show that the class $QIP/qpoly$
contains ALL languages. That is, for any language $L$ (even non-recursive), the
membership $x \in L$ (for $x$ of length $n$) can be proved by a polynomial-size
quantum interactive proof, where the verifier is a polynomial-size quantum
circuit with working space initiated with some quantum state $|\Psi_{L,n} &gt;$
(depending only on $L$ and $n$). Moreover, the interactive proof that we give
is of only one round, and the messages communicated are classical.
  2) PCP with only one query: We show that the membership $x \in SAT$ (for $x$
of length $n$) can be proved by a logarithmic-size quantum state $|\Psi &gt;$,
together with a polynomial-size classical proof consisting of blocks of length
$polylog(n)$ bits each, such that after measuring the state $|\Psi &gt;$ the
verifier only needs to read {\bf one} block of the classical proof.
  While the first result is a straight forward consequence of the new
representation, the second requires an additional machinery of quantum
low-degree-test that may be interesting in its own right.

conceptually very close to quantum nonlocality or superluminality,i.e. quantum
breaking of the famous Bell inequality. Or, generally, he suggests implicitly
an absolute asymmetric duality (subluminality vs. superluminality) principle in
any fundamental physical theory.It, he hopes, can be used for a natural
interpretation of the quantum mechanics too. But we explain that such
Griffiths's interpretation retires implicitly but significantly from usual,
Copenhagen interpretation of the standard quantum mechanical formalism. Within
Copenhagen interpretation basic complementarity principle represents, in fact,
a dynamical symmetry principle (including its spontaneous breaking, i.e.
effective hiding by measurement). Similarly, in other fundamental physical
theories instead of Griffiths's absolute asymmetric duality principle there is
a dynamical symmetry (including its spontaneous breaking, i.e. effective hiding
in some of these theories) principle. Finally, we show that Griffiths's example
of the bug shadow superluminal motion is definitely incorrect (it sharply
contradicts the remarkable Roemer's determination of the speed of light by

paper, we introduce a framework for quantum schemes where Alice commits a
string of n bits to Bob in such a way that she can only cheat on a bits and Bob
can learn at most b bits of information before the reveal phase. Our results
are two-fold: we show by an explicit construction that in the traditional

no good schemes can exist: a+b is at least n. If, however, we use a more
liberal criterion of security, the accessible information, we construct schemes
where a=4log n+O(1) and b=4, which is impossible classically. We furthermore
present a cheat-sensitive quantum bit string commitment protocol for which we
give an explicit tradeoff between Bob's ability to gain information about the

the 1970's. This paper illustrates both that oracles can give us nontrivial
insights about the barrier problems in circuit complexity, and that they need
not prevent us from trying to solve those problems.
  First, we give an oracle relative to which PP has linear-sized circuits, by
proving a new lower bound for perceptrons and low- degree threshold
polynomials. This oracle settles a longstanding open question, and generalizes
earlier results due to Beigel and to Buhrman, Fortnow, and Thierauf. More
importantly, it implies the first nonrelativizing separation of &quot;traditional&quot;
complexity classes, as opposed to interactive proof classes such as MIP and
MA-EXP. For Vinodchandran showed, by a nonrelativizing argument, that PP does
not have circuits of size n^k for any fixed k. We present an alternative proof
of this fact, which shows that PP does not even have quantum circuits of size
n^k with quantum advice. To our knowledge, this is the first nontrivial lower
bound on quantum circuit size.
  Second, we study a beautiful algorithm of Bshouty et al. for learning Boolean
circuits in ZPP^NP. We show that the NP queries in this algorithm cannot be
parallelized by any relativizing technique, by giving an oracle relative to
which ZPP^||NP and even BPP^||NP have linear-size circuits. On the other hand,
we also show that the NP queries could be parallelized if P=NP. Thus, classes
such as ZPP^||NP inhabit a &quot;twilight zone,&quot; where we need to distinguish
between relativizing and black-box techniques. Our results on this subject have
implications for computational learning theory as well as for the circuit
minimization problem.

resonator in the strong coupling regime. Using a semiclassical description for
the atom and field dynamics, we derive a closed system of differential
equations to describe this coupled atom-field dynamics. For sufficiently strong
pumping the system starts lasing when the atom gets close to a field antinode,
and the associated light forces provide for self-trapping of the atom. For a
cavity mode blue detuned with respect to the atomic transition frequency this
is combined with cavity induced motional cooling allowing for long term
steady-state operation of such a laser. The analytical results for temperature
and field statistics agree well with our earlier predictions based on Quantum
Monte Carlo simulations. We find sub-Doppler temperatures that decrease with
gain and coupling strength and can even go beyond the limit of passive cavity
cooling. Besides demonstrating the importance of light forces in single-atom
lasers, this result also gives strong evidence to enhance laser cooling through
stimulated emission in resonators.

complicated nonlinear interplay between fast solitons and slow-light solitons
in the $\Lambda$-type media points to the possibility to create optical gates
and, thus, to control the optical transparency of the $\Lambda$-type media. We
provide an exact analytic description of decelerating, stopping and
re-accelerating of slow-light solitons in atomic media in the nonadiabatic
regime. Dynamical control over slow-light solitons is realized via a
controlling field generated by an auxiliary laser. For a rather general time
dependence of the field; we find the dynamics of the slow-light soliton inside
the medium. We provide an analytical description for the nonlinear dependence
of the velocity of the signal on the controlling field. If the background field
is turned off at some moment of time, the signal stops. We find the location

discuss physically interesting features of our solution, which are in a good

  swapping operation</title><description>  Quantum Information Processing relies on coherent quantum dynamics for a
precise control of its basic operations. A swapping gate in a two-spin system
exchanges the degenerate states |+,-&gt; and |-,+&gt;. In NMR, this is achieved
turning on and off the spin-spin interaction b=\Delta E that splits the energy
levels and induces an oscillation with a natural frequency \Delta E/\hbar.
Interaction of strength \hbar/\tau_{SE}, with an environment of neighboring
spins, degrades this oscillation within a decoherence time scale \tau_{\phi}.
While the experimental frequency \omega and decoherence time \tau_{\phi} were
expected to be roughly proportional to b/\hbar and \tau_{SE} respectively, we
present here experiments that show drastic deviations in both \omega and
\tau_{\phi}. By solving the many spin dynamics, we prove that the swapping
regime is restricted to \Delta E \tau_{SE} &gt; \hbar. Beyond a critical
interaction with the environment the swapping freezes and the decoherence rate
drops as 1/\tau_{\phi} \propto (b/\hbar)^2 \tau_{SE}. The transition between
quantum dynamical phases occurs when \omega \propto
\sqrt{(b/\hbar)^{2}-(k/\tau_{SE})^2} becomes imaginary, resembling an
overdamped classical oscillator. Here, 0&lt;k^2&lt;1 depends only on the anisotropy
of the system-environment interaction, being 0 for isotropic and 1 for XY
interactions. This critical onset of a phase dominated by the Quantum Zeno
effect opens up new opportunities for controlling quantum dynamics.

  Quantum-Antiresonance Transition</title><description>  The quantum kicked particle in a magnetic field is studied in a weak-chaos
regime under realistic conditions, i.e., for {\em general} values of the
conserved coordinate $x_{{\rm c}}$ of the cyclotron orbit center. The system
exhibits spectral structures [``Hofstadter butterflies'' (HBs)] and quantum
diffusion depending sensitively on $x_{{\rm c}}$. Most significant changes take
place when $x_{{\rm c}}$ approaches the value at which quantum antiresonance
(exactly periodic recurrences) can occur: the HB essentially ``doubles'' and
the quantum-diffusion coefficient $D(x_{{\rm c}})$ is strongly reduced. An
explanation of these phenomena, including an approximate formula for $D(x_{{\rm

Hamiltonian which is derived as a power expansion in a small parameter. The
global quantum diffusion of a two-dimensional wave packet for all $x_{{\rm c}}$

called quantum gates and measurements applied to the quantum register of n
quantum bits, qubits. A collection of quantum gates is called universal if it
can be used to construct any n-qubit gate. In 1995, the universality of the set
of one-qubit gates and controlled NOT gate was shown by Barenco et al. using QR
decomposition of unitary matrices. Almost ten years later the decomposition was
improved to include essentially fewer elementary gates. In addition, the
cosine-sine matrix decomposition was applied to efficiently implement
decompositions of general quantum gates. In this chapter, we review the
different types of general gate decompositions and slightly improve the best
known gate count for the controlled NOT gates to (23/48)4^n in the leading
order. In physical realizations, the interaction strength between the qubits
can decrease strongly as a function of their distance. Therefore, we also
discuss decompositions with the restriction to nearest-neighbor interactions in
a linear chain of qubits.

but not in the formulation in phase space. Quantum symmetries are described by
complex, unitary or antiunitary operators defining ray representations in
Hilbert space, whereas in phase space they are described by real, true
representations. Equivalence of the formulations requires that the former
representations can be obtained from the latter and vice versa. Examples are
given. Equivalence of the two formulations also requires that complex
superpositions of state vectors can be described in the phase space
formulation, and it is shown that this leads to a nonlinear superposition

that each successful event introduces an ideal redundant graph edge, which
growth strategies should exploit. For example, if each EO succeeds with
probability p=0.4 then a highly connected graph can be formed with an overhead
of only about ten EO attempts per graph edge. The BK scheme then becomes
competitive with the more elaborate entanglement procedures designed to permit

  experiment under the NAFL interpretation</title><description>  The NAFL (non-Aristotelian finitary logic) interpretation of quantum
mechanics requires that no `physical' reality can be ascribed to the wave
nature of the photon. The NAFL theory QM, formalizing quantum mechanics, treats
the superposed state ($S$) of a single photon taking two or more different
paths at the same time as a logical contradiction that is formally unprovable
in QM. Nevertheless, in a nonclassical NAFL model for QM in which the law of
noncontradiction fails, $S$ has a meaningful metamathematical interpretation
that the classical path information for the photon is not available. It is
argued that the existence of an interference pattern does not logically amount
to a proof of the self-interference of a single photon. This fact, when coupled
with the temporal nature of NAFL truth, implies the logical validity of the
retroactive assertion of the path information (and the logical superfluousness
of the grid) in Afshar's experiment. The Bohr complementarity principle, when
properly interpreted with the time dependence of logical truth taken into
account, holds in Afshar's experiment. NAFL supports, but not demands, a
metalogical reality for the particle nature of the photon even when the
semantics of QM requires the state $S$.

  using and identifying only Bell states</title><description>  First, I show explicitly a scheme to {\it faithfully} and {\it
deterministically} teleport an arbitrary 2-qubit state from Alice to Bob. In
this scheme two same Bell states are sufficient for use. Bob can recover the
2-qubit state by performing at most 4 single-qubit unitary operations
conditioned on Alice's 4-bit classical public message corresponding to her two
Bell-state measurement outcomes. Then I generalize the 2-qubit teleportation
scheme to an aribitrary $N(N\ge 3)$-qubit state teleportation case by using $N$
same Bell states. In the generalized scheme, Alice only needs to identify $N$
Bell states after quantum swapping and then publish her measurement outcomes
($2N$-bit classical message). Conditioned on Alice's $2N$-bit classical
message, Bob only needs to perform at most $2N$ single-qubit unitary operations
to {\it fully} recover the arbitrary state. By comparing with the newest
relevant work [Phys. Rev. A{\bf 71}, 032303(2005)], the advantages of the
present schemes are revealed, respectively.

measurement theory. However, if we do not want to succeed all the time, i.e.
allow for inconclusive outcomes to occur, then unambiguous discrimination
becomes possible with a certain probability of success. A variant of the
problem is set discrimination: the states are grouped in sets and we want to
determine to which particular set a given pure input state belongs. We consider
here the simplest case, termed quantum state filtering, when the $N$ given
non-orthogonal states, $\{|\psi_{1} &gt;,..., |\psi_{N} &gt; \}$, are divided into
two sets and the first set consists of one state only while the second consists
of all of the remaining states. We present the derivation of the optimal
measurement strategy, in terms of a generalized measurement (POVM), to
distinguish $|\psi_1&gt;$ from the set $\{|\psi_2 &gt;,...,|\psi_N &gt; \}$ and the
corresponding optimal success and failure probabilities. The results, but not
the complete derivation, were presented previously [\prl {\bf 90}, 257901

probabilistic quantum algorithms. We also show that the problem is equivalent
to the discrimination of a pure state and an arbitrary mixed state.

that Alice inputs a bit at her end of the device and that Bob does likewise, it
produces two bits, one at Alice's end and one at Bob's end, such that the XOR
of the outputs is equal to the AND of the inputs. This box, inspired from the
CHSH inequality, was first proposed by Popescu and Rohrlich to examine the
question: given that a maximally entangled pair of qubits is non-local, why is
it not maximally non-local? We believe that understanding the power of this box
will yield insight into the non-locality of quantum mechanics. It was shown
recently by Cerf, Gisin, Massar and Popescu, that this imaginary device is able
to simulate correlations from any measurement on a singlet state. Here, we show
that the non-local box can in fact do much more: through the simulation of the
magic square pseudo-telepathy game and the Mermin-GHZ pseudo-telepathy game, we
show that the non-local box can simulate quantum correlations that no entangled
pair of qubits can in a bipartite scenario and even in a multi-party scenario.
Finally we show that a single non-local box cannot simulate all quantum
correlations and propose a generalization for a multi-party non-local box. In
particular, we show quantum correlations whose simulation requires an
exponential amount of non-local boxes, in the number of maximally entangled
qubit pairs.

particular interest to control interference effects, which can alter the system
properties considerably. In this article, we discuss the mechanisms of such
phase control and interference effects in an atomic three-level system in
$\Lambda$ configuration, where the upper state spontaneously decays into the
two lower states. The lower states are coupled by a driving field, which we
treat as quantized. This allows for an interpretation on the single photon
level for both the vacuum and the driving field. By analyzing the system
behavior for a driving field initially in non-classical states with only few
Fock number states populated, we find that even though the driving field is
coupled to the lower states only, it induces a multiplet of upper states. Then
interference occurs independently in three-level subsystems in $V$
configuration, each formed by two adjacent upper states and a single dressed
lower state.

Moreover, each of the controllers is required to take only a product

the intrinsic efficiency of qubits approaches the maximal value. With a new

characterization of combinatorially independent permutation separability
criteria. Combinatorial independence is a necessary condition for permutations
to yield truly independent criteria meaning that that no criterion is strictly
stronger that any other. In this paper we observe that some of these criteria
are still dependent and analyze why these dependencies occur. To remove them we
introduce an improved necessary condition and give a complete classification of
the remaining permutations. We conjecture that the remaining class of criteria
only contains truly independent permutation separability criteria. Our
conjecture is based on the proof that for two, three and four parties all these
criteria are truly independent and on numerical verification of their
independence for up to 8 parties. It was commonly believed that for three
parties there were 9 independent criteria, here we prove that there are exactly
6 independent criteria for three parties and 22 for four parties.

A key feature of our

and to allow the votes to be tallied. The entanglement is distributed over
separated sites; the physical inaccessibility of any one site is sufficient to
guarantee the anonymity of the votes. The security of these protocols with
respect to various kinds of attack is discussed. We also discuss classical
schemes and show that our quantum voting protocol represents a N-fold reduction
in computational complexity, where N is the number of voters.

system of three qubits arranged in a linear geometry and a system of four
qubits arranged in a square geometry. Calculations are performed for several
quantum dot confining potentials. In the three-qubit case, three-body effects
are identified that have an important quantitative influence upon quantum

both three-body and four-body interactions that significantly influence the

  Periodic Table</title><description>  In 1959 Ya. B. Zel'dovich predicted that the bound-state spectrum of the
non-relativistic Coulomb problem distorted at small distances by a short-range
potential undergoes a peculiar reconstruction whenever this potential alone
supports a low-energy scattering resonance. However documented experimental
evidence of this effect has been lacking. Previous theoretical studies of this
phenomenon were confined to the regime where the range of the short-ranged
potential is much smaller than Bohr's radius of the Coulomb field. We go beyond
this limitation by restricting ourselves to highly-excited s states. This
allows us to demonstrate that along the Periodic Table of elements the
Zel'dovich effect manifests itself as systematic periodic variation of the
Rydberg spectra with a period proportional to the cubic root of the atomic
number. This dependence, which is supported by analysis of experimental and
numerical data, has its origin in the binding properties of the ionic core of
the atom.

box, if the XOR of the output bits equals the AND of the input bits. In a
recent article, Cerf et al. show that Alice and Bob, using such a PR box, can
effectively simulate entanglement without the need of communication. We show
that an adaptation of a model due to Dirk Aerts, yields a realistic simulation
of the non-local PR box without communication. Because the model is entirely
realistic, it cannot violate relativistic constraints. Like a non-local box, it
can be used to simulate the singlet state coincidence probabilities, but the
time to complete the observation of the outcome will exceed the time it takes a
photon to travel one arm in an EPRB setup. The model explicitly shows how to
produce an outcome that is locally perfectly random, but nevertheless
determines what happens in the other wing of the experiment, without
communication taking place between the two wings. In this sense, it can serve
as an accurate metaphor for the mechanism of entanglement. The model
considerably strengthens the claim that no communication is necessary to
simulate entanglement.

the spectrum matches the symmetry of a fermion or boson system in a certain

operation on the medium. Based on this observation the well-established results
for the QST via quantum spin chains can be generalized to the high-dimensional

tight-binding fermion system with uniform NN hopping integral, we show that an
arbitrary many-particle state near the fermi surface can be perfectly

vanishes in the feedback loop (FBL). It means that the direct photodetection,
supplying us with the electron statistics, does not provide us with a wished
information about the laser photon statistics. For getting this information we
should think up another measurement procedure, and we in the article suggest
applying the three-level laser as a auxiliary measuring device. This laser has
impressive property, namely, its photon statistics survive information about
the initial photon statistics of the laser which excites coherently the
three-level medium. Thus, if we choose the laser in the FBL as exciting the
three-level laser, then we have an possibility to evaluate its initial photon
statistics by means of direct detecting the three-level laser emission.
Finally, this approach allows us to conclude the feedback is not capable of
creating a regularity in the laser light beam. Contrary, the final photon
fluctuations turn out to be always even bigger. The mentioned above feature of
the three-level laser takes place only for the strong interaction between the
lasers (exciting and excited). It means the initial state of the exciting laser
is changed dramatically, so our measurement procedure can not be identified
with some non-demolition one.

that it has distances $L_1$ and $L_2$ to two users. After taking into account
various effects like loss of photons, deficiencies in the source and detectors,
an entangled pair traveling through the channel may loose its perfect
correlation due to errors in the channel. How the entanglement of the received
pair depends on the above distances and the local properties of the channels
used for this transmission? What is the best location of the source if we want
to achieve the highest fidelity? What is the threshold distance beyond which
the entanglement of the pair vanishes and becomes useless for using in
teleportation. We discuss these problems for the Pauli channel which simulates
the effect of optical fibers and possibly the atmosphere on the

  local quantum physics</title><description>  In the past two-dimensional models of QFT have served as theoretical
laboratories for testing new concepts under mathematically controllable
condition. In more recent times low-dimensional models (e.g. chiral models,
factorizing models) often have been treated by special recipes in a way which
sometimes led to a loss of unity of QFT. In the present work I try to
counteract this apartheid tendency by reviewing past results within the setting
of the general principles of QFT. To this I add two new ideas: (1) a modular
interpretation of the chiral model Diff(S)-covariance with a close connection
to the recently formulated local covariance principle for QFT in curved
spacetime and (2) a derivation of the chiral model temperature duality from a
suitable operator formulation of the angular Wick rotation (in analogy to the
Nelson-Symanzik duality in the Ostertwalder-Schrader setting) for rational
chiral theories. The SL(2,Z) modular Verlinde relation is a special case of
this thermal duality and (within the family of rational models) the matrix S
appearing in the thermal duality relation becomes identified with the
statistics character matrix S. The relevant angular Euclideanization'' is done
in the setting of the Tomita-Takesaki modular formalism of operator algebras.
  I find it appropriate to dedicate this work to the memory of J. A. Swieca
with whom I shared the interest in two-dimensional models as a testing ground
for QFT for more than one decade.

The game can not be won without communication in the classical world. But if

deterministically using no communication. This again shows that though quantum

positively for the power queries used for the Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue

(non-oblivious) quantum read-once branching programs. It is shown that the
computational power of quantum and classical read-once branching programs is
incomparable in the following sense: (i) A simple, explicit boolean function on
2n input bits is presented that is computable by error-free quantum read-once
branching programs of size O(n^3), while each classical randomized read-once
branching program and each quantum OBDD for this function with bounded
two-sided error requires size 2^{\Omega(n)}. (ii) Quantum branching programs
reading each input variable exactly once are shown to require size
2^{\Omega(n)} for computing the set-disjointness function DISJ_n from
communication complexity theory with two-sided error bounded by a constant
smaller than 1/2-2\sqrt{3}/7. This function is trivially computable even by
deterministic OBDDs of linear size. The technically most involved part is the
proof of the lower bound in (ii). For this, a new model of quantum
multi-partition communication protocols is introduced and a suitable extension
of the information cost technique of Jain, Radhakrishnan, and Sen (2003) to
this model is presented.

single photon signals, but the sources used in typical practical realizations
emit weak coherent states instead. A weak coherent state may contain more than
one photon, which poses a potential security risk. QKD with weak coherent state
signals has nevertheless been proven to be secure, but only under the
assumption that the phase of each signal is random (and completely unknown to
the adversary). Since this assumption need not be fully justified in practice,
it is important to know whether phase randomization is really a requirement for
security rather than a convenient technical assumption that makes the security
proof easier. Here, we exhibit an explicit attack in which the eavesdropper
exploits knowledge of the phase of the signals, and show that this attack
allows the eavesdropper to learn every key bit in a parameter regime where a
protocol using phase-randomized signals is provably secure. Thus we demonstrate
that phase randomization really does enhance the security of QKD using weak
coherent states. This result highlights the importance of a careful
characterization of the source for proofs of the security of quantum key
distribution.

condensate of bosons is studied in the framework of second quantization method.
A toy model is proposed and its general solution within the Bogoliubov
approximation is obtained. The effective Minkowski space-time structure arises
naturally in this non-relativistic quantum many-body system in the low energy
regime. This is shown to be true in this model. Several examples are discussed
in order to illustrate our model. The homogeneous condensate produces an
effective Yukawa type attractive force between impurities sitting in
condensate. Landau's criterion is naturally derived in a case of linear motion
of impurity. The analytic expressions for spectra of Bogoliubov excitations
produced by the accelerated motions of impurities are obtained. A quick look at
the analytic expression reveals that the spectrum of gapless excitations
emitted by the linearly accelerated impurity {\it is not thermal}. If the
homogeneous condensate is the physically correct model for Minkowski space-time
then it follows that the apparent thermal response of the simple linearly
accelerated detector models may be the result of improper regularization.

substrate is calculated out of thermal equilibrium in terms of the dielectric
function of the material and of the atomic polarizability. The new force decays
like $1/z^3$ at large distances (i.e. slower than at equilibrium), exhibits a

whether the temperature of the substrate is higher or smaller than the one of

resource, effort has been made to find an efficient way to tell whether a given
density matrix represents an unentangled, or separable, state. Essentially,
this is the quantum separability problem.
  Chapters 1 to 3 motivate a new interior-point algorithm which, given the
expected values of a subset of an orthogonal basis of observables of an
otherwise unknown quantum state, searches for an entanglement witness in the
span of the subset of observables. When all the expected values are known, the
algorithm solves the separability problem. In Chapter 4, I give the motivation
for the algorithm and show how it can be used in a particular physical scenario
to detect entanglement (or decide separability) of an unknown quantum state
using as few quantum resources as possible. I then explain the intuitive idea
behind the algorithm and relate it to the standard algorithms of its kind. I
end the chapter with a comparison of the complexities of the algorithms
surveyed in Chapter 3. Finally, in Chapter 5, I present the details of the
algorithm and discuss its performance relative to standard methods.

which it is embedded is central to the quantum information theory. This paper
suggests that the concurrence hierarchy as an entanglement measure provides an
alternative view of how to think about this problem. We consider mixed states
of two qubits and obtain an exact solution of the time-dependent master
equation that describes the evolution of two two-level qubits (or atoms) within
a perfect cavity for the case of multiphoton transition. We consider the
situation for which the field may start from a binomial state. Employing this
solution, the significant features of the entanglement when a second qubit is
weakly coupled to the field and becomes entangled with the first qubit, is
investigated. We also describe the response of the atomic system as it varies
between the Rabi oscillations and the collapse-revival mode and investigate the
atomic inversion and the Q-function. We identify and numerically demonstrate
the region of parameters where significantly large entanglement can be
obtained. Most interestingly, it is shown that features of the entanglement is
influenced significantly when the multi-photon process is involved. Finally, we
obtain illustrative examples of some novel aspects of this system and show how
the off-resonant case can sensitize entanglement to the role of initial state
setting.

high temperatures and low densities, for which quantum-mechanical effects have
virtually no impact. However, recent technological advances (particularly on
miniaturized semiconductor devices and nanoscale objects) have made it possible
to envisage practical applications of plasma physics where the quantum nature
of the particles plays a crucial role. Here, I shall review different
approaches to the modeling of quantum effects in electrostatic collisionless
plasmas. The full kinetic model is provided by the Wigner equation, which is
the quantum analog of the Vlasov equation. The Wigner formalism is particularly
attractive, as it recasts quantum mechanics in the familiar classical phase
space, although this comes at the cost of dealing with negative distribution
functions. Equivalently, the Wigner model can be expressed in terms of $N$
one-particle Schr{\&quot;o}dinger equations, coupled by Poisson's equation: this is
the Hartree formalism, which is related to the `multi-stream' approach of
classical plasma physics. In order to reduce the complexity of the above
approaches, it is possible to develop a quantum fluid model by taking
velocity-space moments of the Wigner equation. Finally, certain regimes at
large excitation energies can be described by semiclassical kinetic models
(Vlasov-Poisson), provided that the initial ground-state equilibrium is treated
quantum-mechanically. The above models are validated and compared both in the
linear and nonlinear regimes.

qualitatively different for short and long evolution times. We also find a

algorithms, of having a fixed point, i.e. monotonic convergence towards the
solution. Recently a fixed point quantum search algorithm has been discovered,
referred to as the Phase-$\pi/3$ search algorithm, which gets around this
limitation. While searching a database for a target state, this algorithm
reduces the error probability from $\epsilon$ to $\epsilon^{2q+1}$ using $q$
oracle queries, which has since been proved to be asymptotically optimal. A
different algorithm is presented here, which has the same worst-case behavior
as the Phase-$\pi/3$ search algorithm but much better average-case behavior.
Furthermore the new algorithm gives $\epsilon^{2q+1}$ convergence for all
integral $q$, whereas the Phase-$\pi/3$ search algorithm requires $q$ to be
$(3^{n}-1)/2$ with $n$ a positive integer. In the new algorithm, the operations
are controlled by two ancilla qubits, and fixed point behavior is achieved by
irreversible measurement operations applied to these ancillas. It is an example
of how measurement can allow us to bypass some restrictions imposed by
unitarity on quantum computing.

Floquet theory, we derive in each case an equation which determines the
stability of the metastable system. We study the influence on the stability of
two Floquet states when their Floquet energies (real part) encounter a direct

on the nature of crossing of Floquet energies is also discussed. It is found
that by adiabatically changing the frequency and amplitude of the oscillation
field, one can manipulate the stability of states in the well. By means of a
discrete transform, the two models are shown to have exactly the same Floquet
energy spectrum at the same oscillating amplitude and frequency. The
equivalence of the models is also demonstrated by means of the principle of
gauge invariance.

large-scale quantum computers, because their low energy collective excitations
evolve reversibly, effectively isolated from the environment. The design of
reversible computers is constrained by the laws governing entropy flow within
the computer. In near-critical quantum circuits, entropy flows as a locally
conserved quantum current, obeying circuit laws analogous to the electric
circuit laws. The quantum entropy current is just the energy current divided by
the temperature. A quantum circuit made from a near-critical system (of
conventional type) is described by a relativistic 1+1 dimensional relativistic
quantum field theory on the circuit. The universal properties of the
energy-momentum tensor constrain the entropy flow characteristics of the
circuit components: the entropic conductivity of the quantum wires and the
entropic admittance of the quantum circuit junctions. For example,
near-critical quantum wires are always resistanceless inductors for entropy. A
universal formula is derived for the entropic conductivity:
\sigma_S(\omega)=iv^{2}S/\omega T, where \omega is the frequency, T the
temperature, S the equilibrium entropy density and v the velocity of ``light''.
The thermal conductivity is Real(T\sigma_S(\omega))=\pi v^{2}S\delta(\omega).
The thermal Drude weight is, universally, v^{2}S. This gives a way to measure
the entropy density directly.

The entropic admittance of a near-critical junction in a bulk-critical circuit
is expressed in terms of commutators of the chiral entropy currents. The
entropic admittance at low frequency, divided by the frequency, gives the
change of the junction entropy with temperature -- the entropic
``capacitance''. As an example, and as a check on the formalism, the entropic

violations of local realism arise almost everywhere without entanglement. The
pivotal fact driving these violations is just the noncommutativity of quantum

  trapping</title><description>  We demonstrate an atom localization scheme based on monitoring of the atomic
coherences. We consider atomic transitions in a Lambda configuration where the
control field is a standing wave field. The probe field and the control field
produce coherence between the two ground states. We show that this coherence
has the same fringe pattern as produced by a Fabry-Perot interferometer and
thus measurement of the atomic coherence would localize the atom. Interestingly
enough the role of the cavity finesse is played by the ratio of the intensities

subwavelenth localization. We suggest several methods to monitor the produced

Universe, are strongly correlated and strongly interacting fermionic systems,
which cannot be treated perturbatively. However, physics which emerges in the
low-energy does not depend on the complicated details of the system and is
relatively simple. It is determined by the nodes in the fermionic spectrum,
which are protected by topology in momentum space (in some cases, in
combination with the vacuum symmetry). Here we illustrate this universality on
some examples of quantum phase transitions, which can occur between the vacua
with the same symmetry but with diferent topology in momentum space. The
quantum phase transitions between the fully gapped states with different
momentum-space topology are also discussed.

inhomogeneous systems of ODEs. In contrast to the usual Hamiltonian mechanics,
our approach is based on the use of non-stationary Poisson brackets, i.e.
corresponding Poisson tensor is allowed to explicitly depend on time. Starting
from this pseudo-Hamiltonian formulation we develop a consistent deformation
quantization procedure involving a non-stationary star-product $*_t$ and an
``extended'' operator of time derivative $D_t=\partial_t+...$, differentiating
the $\ast_t$-product. As in the usual case, the $\ast_t$-algebra of physical
observables is shown to admit an essentially unique (time dependent) trace
functional $\mathrm{Tr}_t$. Using these ingredients we construct a complete and
fully consistent quantum-mechanical description for any linear dynamical system
with or without dissipation. The general quantization method is exemplified by
the models of damped oscillator and radiating point charge.

storage in decoherence processes. Redundancy has been proposed as a
prerequisite for objectivity, the defining property of classical objects. We
consider two ensembles of states for a model universe consisting of one system
and many environments: the first consisting of arbitrary states, and the second
consisting of ``singly-branching'' states consistent with a simple decoherence
model. Typical states from the random ensemble do not store information about
the system redundantly, but information stored in branching states has a
redundancy proportional to the environment's size. We compute the specific
redundancy for a wide range of model universes, and fit the results to a simple
first-principles theory. Our results show that the presence of redundancy
divides information about the system into three parts: classical (redundant);
purely quantum; and the borderline, undifferentiated or ``nonredundant,''
information.

states (more precisely, two complementary bases) for the encoding of the
classical bit. Recently, it has been noticed that by using the same four
states, but a different encoding of information, one can define a new protocol
which is more robust in practical implementations, specifically when attenuated
laser pulses are used instead of single-photon sources [V. Scarani et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92}, 057901 (2004); referred to as SARG04]. We present a
detailed study of SARG04 in two different regimes. In the first part, we
consider an implementation with a single-photon source: we derive bounds on the
error rate $Q$ for security against all possible attacks by the eavesdropper.
The lower and the upper bound obtained for SARG04 ($Q\lesssim 10.95%$ and
$Q\gtrsim 14.9%$ respectively) are close to those obtained for BB84 ($Q\lesssim
12.4%$ and $Q\gtrsim 14.6%$ respectively). In the second part, we consider the
realistic source consisting of an attenuated laser and improve on previous
analysis by allowing Alice to optimize the mean number of photons as a function
of the distance. SARG04 is found to perform better than BB84, both in secret
key rate and in maximal achievable distance, for a wide class of Eve's attacks.

  Procedures</title><description>  The stabiliser formalism allows the efficient description of a sizeable class
of pure as well as mixed quantum states of N-qubit systems. That same formalism
has important applications in the field of quantum error correcting codes,
where mixed stabiliser states correspond to projectors on subspaces associated
with stabiliser codes. Here, we derive efficient reduction procedures to obtain
various useful normal forms for stabiliser states. We explicitly prove that
these procedures will always converge to the correct result and that these
procedures are efficient in that they only require a polynomial number of
operations on the generators of the stabilisers.
  We obtain two single-party normal forms. The simplest, the row-reduced
echelon form, is useful to calculate partial traces of stabiliser states. The
second is the fully reduced form and allows for the efficient calculation of
the overlap between two stabiliser states, as well as of the Uhlmann fidelity
between them, and their Bures distance.
  We also find a reduction procedure of bipartite stabiliser states, where the
operations involved are restricted to be local ones. Using this two-party
normal form, we prove that every bipartite mixed stabiliser state is locally
equivalent to a direct product of a number of maximally entangled states and a
separable state. Using this normal form we can efficiently calculate every
reasonable bipartite entanglement measure of mixed stabiliser states.

gives rise to the asymptotically optimal EPR pair distillation procedure for a
given tripartite pure state, and we show that it actually yields EPR and GHZ
states; in fact, under a restricted class of protocols, which we call &quot;one-way
broadcasting&quot;, the GHZ-rate is shown to be optimal.
  This result implies a capacity theorem for quantum channels where the
environment helps transmission by broadcasting the outcome of an optimally
chosen measurement. We discuss generalisations to m parties, and show (for m=4)
that the maximal amount of entanglement that can be localised between two
parties is given by the smallest entropy of a group of parties of which the one
party is a member, but not the other. This gives an explicit expression for the
asymptotic localisable entanglement, and shows that any nontrivial ground state
of a spin system can be used as a perfect quantum repeater if many copies are
available in parallel.
  Finally, we provide evidence that any unital channel is asymptotically
equivalent to a mixture of unitaries, and any general channel to a mixture of
partial isometries.

fact that the replacement of the time derivative by the backward difference
operator alone can preserve the non-negativity of the phase space density. It
is seen that, even for free particles, all the degrees of freedom are {\it
correlated} in principle. The forward evolution of functions of phase space
variables by a finite number of time steps, in this discrete-time mechanics,
depends on the entire continuous-time history in the interval $[0, \infty]$. In
this sense, discrete time evolution is {\it nonlocal} in time from a
continuous-time point of view. A corresponding quantum mechanical treatment is
possible {\it via} the density matrix approach. The interference between
non-degenerate quantum mechanical states decays exponentially. This {\it

practical importance only in macroscopic systems, or in processes involving
large energy changes.

The dynamics of such systems is intrinsically nonlinear even at the level of

become an important bridge between physics and diverse disciplines. Its
fundamental physical mechanism, however, is largely obscure. This study made
the first attempt to connect fractional Schrodinger equation and soft matter
physics under a consistent framework from empirical power scaling to
phenomenological kinetics and macromechanics to mesoscopic quantum mechanics.
The original contributions are the fractional quantum relationships, which show
Levy statistics and fractional Brownian motion are essentially related to
momentum and energy, respectively. The fractional quantum underlies fractal
mesostructures and many-body interactions of macromolecules in soft matter and

two basic steps: delivery of the signals over a quantum channel and
distillation of a secret key from the signal and measurement records by
classical processing and public communication. Here we formalize the
distillation process for a general protocol in a purely quantum-mechanical
framework and demonstrate that it can be viewed as creating an ``effective''
quantum channel between the legitimate users Alice and Bob. The process of
secret key generation can then be viewed as entanglement distribution using
this channel, which enables application of entanglement-based security proofs
to essentially any prepare and measure protocol. To ensure secrecy of the key,
Alice and Bob must be able to estimate the channel noise from errors in the
key, and we further show how symmetries of the distillation process simplify
this task. Applying this method, we prove the security of several key
distribution protocols based on equiangular spherical codes.

much quantum communication is needed to transfer the full state to one system.
This communication measures the &quot;partial information&quot; one system needs
conditioned on it's prior information. It turns out to be given by an extremely
simple formula, the conditional entropy. In the classical case, partial
information must always be positive, but we find that in the quantum world this
physical quantity can be negative. If the partial information is positive, its
sender needs to communicate this number of quantum bits to the receiver; if it
is negative, the sender and receiver instead gain the corresponding potential
for future quantum communication. We introduce a primitive &quot;quantum state
merging&quot; which optimally transfers partial information. We show how it enables
a systematic understanding of quantum network theory, and discuss several
important applications including distributed compression, multiple access
channels and multipartite assisted entanglement distillation (localizable
entanglement). Negative channel capacities also receive a natural

microsystem, S, coupled to a finite macroscopic measuring instrument, I, which
itself is an N-particle quantum system. The pointer positions of I correspond
to the macrostates of this instrument, as represented by orthogonal subspaces
of the Hilbert space of its pure states. These subspaces, or 'phase cells', are
the simultaneous eigenspaces of a set of coarse grained intercommuting
macroscopic observables, M, and, crucially, are of astronomically large

on the conservative dynamics of the composite (S+I) under which it yields both
a reduction of the wave packet describing the state of S and a one-to-one
correspondence, following a measurement, between the pointer position of I and
the resultant state of S; and we show that these conditions are fulfilled by

the familiar diagonalization of the Hamiltonian in the second quantized
formulation. A hidden local gauge symmetry, which is associated with the
arbitrariness of the phase choice of a complete orthonormal basis set, becomes
explicit in this formulation (in particular, in the adiabatic approximation)
and specifies physical observables. The choice of a basis set which specifies
the coordinate in the functional space is arbitrary in the second quantization,
and a sub-class of coordinate transformations, which keeps the form of the
action invariant, is recognized as the gauge symmetry. We discuss the
implications of this hidden local gauge symmetry in detail by analyzing
geometric phases for cyclic and noncyclic evolutions. It is shown that the
hidden local symmetry provides a basic concept alternative to the notion of
holonomy to analyze geometric phases and that the analysis based on the hidden
local gauge symmetry leads to results consistent with the general prescription
of Pancharatnam. We however note an important difference between the geometric
phases for cyclic and noncyclic evolutions. We also explain a basic difference
between our hidden local gauge symmetry and a gauge symmetry (or equivalence
class) used by Aharonov and Anandan in their definition of generalized
geometric phases.

must describe relations between systems. Using a simple model, we investigate
how such a relational quantum theory naturally arises by promoting reference
systems to the status of dynamical entities. Our goal is to demonstrate using
elementary quantum theory how any quantum mechanical experiment admits a purely
relational description at a fundamental level, from which the original
&quot;non-relational&quot; theory emerges in a semi-classical limit. According to this
thesis, the non-relational theory is therefore an approximation of the
fundamental relational theory. We propose four simple rules that can be used to
translate an &quot;orthodox&quot; quantum mechanical description into a relational
description, independent of an external spacial reference frame or clock. The
techniques used to construct these relational theories are motivated by a
Bayesian approach to quantum mechanics, and rely on the noiseless subsystem
method of quantum information science used to protect quantum states against
undesired noise. The relational theory naturally predicts a fundamental
decoherence mechanism, so an arrow of time emerges from a time-symmetric
theory. Moreover, there is no need for a &quot;collapse of the wave packet&quot; in our
model: the probability interpretation is only applied to diagonal density
operators. Finally, the physical states of the relational theory can be
described in terms of &quot;spin networks&quot; introduced by Penrose as a combinatorial
description of geometry, and widely studied in the loop formulation of quantum
gravity. Thus, our simple bottom-up approach (starting from the semi-classical
limit to derive the fully relational quantum theory) may offer interesting
insights on the low energy limit of quantum gravity.

-- even stormy, in the minds of some people. However, much of the confusion may
stem from inappropriate comparisons using formal analyses. In contrast, our
starting point here is that a complete dynamical description requires a full
understanding of the evolution of measured systems, necessary to explain actual
experimental results. This is of course true, both classically and quantum
mechanically. Because the evolution of the physical state is now conditioned on
measurement results, the dynamics of such systems is intrinsically nonlinear
even at the level of distribution functions. Due to this feature, the
physically more complete treatment reveals the existence of dynamical regimes
-- such as chaos -- that have no direct counterpart in the linear (unobserved)
case. Moreover, this treatment allows for understanding how an effective
classical behavior can result from the dynamics of an observed quantum system,
both at the level of trajectories as well as distribution functions. Finally,
we have the striking prediction that time-series from measured quantum systems
can be chaotic far from the classical regime, with Lyapunov exponents differing
from their classical values. These predictions can be tested in next-generation
experiments.

 From the analysis of the intracavity field fluctuations, we obtain the Casimir

model of simultaneous quantum message passing with shared randomness. We define
a relation which can be efficiently exactly solved in the first model but
cannot be solved efficiently, either exactly or in 0-error setup in the second

model of simultaneous classical message passing with shared entanglement.
  As our second contribution we strengthen a result by Yao that a &quot;very short&quot;
protocol from the model of simultaneous classical message passing with shared
randomness can be simulated in the model of simultaneous quantum message
passing: for a boolean function f, QII(f) \in exp(O(RIIp(f))) log n.
  We show a similar result for protocols from a (stronger) model of 1-way
classical message passing with shared randomness: QII(f) \in exp(O(RIp(f))) log
n.
  We demonstrate a problem whose efficient solution in the model of

the region. This area law is rigorously proven to hold true in non-critical
harmonic lattice system of arbitrary spatial dimension, for general
finite-ranged harmonic interactions, regions of arbitrary shape and states of
nonzero temperature. For nearest-neighbor interactions - corresponding to the
Klein-Gordon case - upper and lower bounds to the degree of entanglement can be
stated explicitly for arbitrarily shaped regions, generalizing the findings of
[Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 060503 (2005)]. These higher dimensional analogues of the
analysis of block entropies in the one-dimensional case show that under general
conditions, one can expect an area law for the entanglement in non-critical
harmonic many-body systems. The proofs make use of methods from entanglement
theory, as well as of results on matrix functions of block banded matrices.
Disordered systems are also considered. We moreover construct a class of
examples for which the two-point correlation length diverges, yet still an area

transforms POVM's into POVM's, generally irreversibly, thus loosing some of the
information retrieved from the measurement. This poses the problem of which
POVM's are &quot;undisturbed&quot;, namely they are not irreversibly connected to another
POVM. We will call such POVM clean. In a sense, the clean POVM's would be
&quot;perfect&quot;, since they would not have any additional &quot;extrinsical&quot; noise. Quite
unexpectedly, it turns out that such cleanness property is largely unrelated to
the convex structure of POVM's, and there are clean POVM's that are not
extremal and vice-versa. In this paper we solve the cleannes classification

In fact, all known solutions are coupled to specific properties of the

  In this article we discuss and develop analytic methods for solving
time-dependent tunneling problems, which cannot be addressed by using quadratic
Hamiltonians. Specifically, we give an analytic solution to the problem of
tunneling from an attractive time-dependent potential which is embedded in a
long-range repulsive potential.
  Recent progress in atomic physics makes it possible to observe experimentally

bipartite input with classical bipartite output such that no signal can be sent
from a party to the other through the use of the box. The quantum counterpart
of such boxes, i.e. completely positive trace-preserving maps on bipartite
states, though studied in literature, have been investigated less intensively
than classical boxes. We present here some results and remarks about such maps.
In particular, we analyze: the relations among properties as causality,
non-locality and entanglement; the connection between causal and entanglement
breaking maps; the characterization of causal maps in terms of the
classification of states with fixed reductions. We also provide new proofs of
the fact that every non-product unitary transformation is not causal, as well
as for the equivalence of the so-called semicausality and semilocalizability
properties.

  quantum limit without entanglement</title><description>  We introduce methods for clock synchronization that make use of the adiabatic
exchange of nondegenerate two-level quantum systems: ticking qubits. Schemes
involving the exchange of N independent qubits with frequency $\omega$ give a
synchronization accuracy that scales as $(\omega\sqrt{N})^{-1}$, i.e., as the
standard quantum limit. We introduce a protocol that makes use of N coherent
exchanges of a single qubit at frequency $\omega$, leading to an accuracy that
scales as $(\omega N)^{-1}\log N$. This protocol beats the standard quantum
limit without the use of entanglement, and we argue that this scaling is the
fundamental limit for clock synchronization allowed by quantum mechanics. We
analyse the performance of these protocols when used with a lossy channel.

dispersing and absorbing media the input-output problem of a high-$Q$ cavity is
studied, with special emphasis on the absorption losses in the coupling mirror.
As expected, the cavity modes are found to obey quantum Langevin equations,
which could be also obtained from quantum noise theories, by appropriately
coupling the cavity modes to dissipative systems, including the effect of the
mirror-assisted absorption losses. On the contrary, the operator input-output
relations obtained in this way would be incomplete in general, as the exact

problem of extracting the quantum state of an initially excited cavity mode is
studied and input-output relations for the $s$-parameterized phase-space
function are derived, with special emphasis on the relation between the Wigner
functions of the quantum states of the outgoing field and the cavity field.

of CVPQC we naturally define a &quot;maximally&quot; mixed state in phase space together
with its explicit construction and show that for increasing number of
encryption operations (which sets the length of a shared key between Alice and
Bob) the encrypted state is arbitrarily close to the maximally mixed state in
the sense of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance. We bring the exact solution for the
distance dependence and give also a rough estimate of the necessary number of
bits of the shared secret key (i.e. how much classical resources are needed for
an approximate encryption of a generally unknown continuous-variable state).
The definition of the CVPQC is analyzed from the Holevo bound point of view
which determines an upper bound of information about an incoming state an
eavesdropper is able to get from his optimal measurement.

i.e. where the rate of change of the two are anti-correlated. This behavior
contrasts with the case of pure light-matter states in which the rate of change
of the two entropies are positively correlated and in fact identical. We give
an analytical derivation of the anti-correlation phenomenon and discuss the

region of the Bloch sphere characterized by entropy exchange and that
characterized by minimal entanglement as measured by the negative eigenvalues

experiment for which certain Bell inequalities are violated. These violations
are {\it in principle} measurable because, unlike for Hawking radiation from
black holes, in inflationary cosmology we can have access to both members of
correlated pairs of modes delivered in the same state. We then compute the
effect of decoherence and show that the violations persist provided the
decoherence level (and thus the entropy) lies below a certain non-vanishing
threshold. Moreover, there exists a higher threshold above which no violation
of any Bell inequality can occur. In this regime, the distributions are
``separable'' and can be interpreted as stochastic ensembles of fluctuations.
Unfortunately, the precision which is required to have access to the quantum

  source-channel duality, and time reversal</title><description>  Two quantum information processing protocols are said to be dual under
resource reversal if the resources consumed (generated) in one protocol are
generated (consumed) in the other. Previously known examples include the
duality between entanglement concentration and dilution, and the duality
between coherent versions of teleportation and super-dense coding. A quantum
feedback channel is an isometry from a system belonging to Alice to a system
shared between Alice and Bob. We show that such a resource may be reversibly
decomposed into a perfect quantum channel and pure entanglement, generalizing
both of the above examples. The dual protocols responsible for this
decomposition are the ``feedback father'' (FF) protocol and the ``fully quantum
reverse Shannon'' (FQRS) protocol. Moreover, the ``fully quantum Slepian-Wolf''
protocol (FQSW), a generalization of the recently discovered ``quantum state
merging'', is related to FF by source-channel duality, and to FQRS by time
reversal duality, thus forming a triangle of dualities. The source-channel
duality is identified as the origin of the previously poorly understood
``mother-father'' duality. Due to a symmetry breaking, the dualities extend
only partially to classical information theory.

quantum computing, and other experiments relying on single-photon interference,
inherently require complete photon indistinguishability to enable the desired
photonic interactions to take place. Mode-mismatch is the dominant cause of
photon distinguishability in optical circuits. Here we study the effects of
photon wave-packet shape on tolerance against the effects of mode-mismatch in
linear optical circuits, and show that Gaussian distributed photons with large
bandwidth are optimal. The result is general and holds for arbitrary linear
optical circuits, including ones which allow for post-selection and classical
feed-forward.

is presented. Existing models are then improved by considering more general
working conditions. Especially, the mazer physics is investigated in the
situation where a detuning between the cavity mode and the atomic transition
frequency is present. Interesting new effects are pointed out. Especially, it
is shown that the cavity may slow down or speed up the atoms according to the
sign of the detuning and that the induced emission process may be completely
blocked by use of a positive detuning. The transmission probability of
ultracold atoms through a micromaser is also studied and we generalize previous
results established in the resonant case. In particular, it is shown that the
velocity selection of cold atoms passing through the micromaser can be very
easily tuned and enhanced using a nonresonant field inside the cavity. This
manuscript is a summary of Martin's master thesis and articles [Phys. Rev. A
67, 053804 (2003)] and [Eur. Phys. J. D 29, 133 (2004)].

(for example, the Levi-Civita connection) and a closed 2-form (magnetic field)
we define a Hilbert algebra structure in the space $L^2(T^*\cal M)$ and
construct an irreducible representation of this algebra in $L^2(\cal M)$. This
algebra is automatically extended to polynomial in momenta functions and
distributions. Under some natural conditions this algebra is unique. The
non-commutative product over $T^*\cal M$ is given by an explicit integral
formula. This product is exact (not formal) and is expressed in invariant
geometrical terms. Our analysis reveals this product has a front, which is
described in terms of geodesic triangles in $\cal M$. The quantization of
$\delta$-functions induces a family of symplectic reflections in $T^*\cal M$
and generates a magneto-geodesic connection $\Gamma$ on $T^*\cal M$. This
symplectic connection entangles, on the phase space level, the original affine
structure on $\cal M$ and the magnetic field. In the classical approximation,
the $\hbar^2$-part of the quantum product contains the Ricci curvature of
$\Gamma$ and a magneto-geodesic coupling tensor.

optimized analytically and it is proven that in the latter case the squeezing
converges exponentially fast to its asymptotic optimum, which we determine

  space</title><description>  Extended phase space (EPS) formulation of quantum statistical mechanics
treats the ordinary phase space coordinates on the same footing and thereby
permits the definite the canonical momenta conjugate to these coordinates . The
extended lagrangian and extended hamiltonian are defined in EPS by the same
procedure as one does for ordinary lagrangian and hamiltonian. The combination
of ordinary phase space and their conjugate momenta exhibits the evolution of
particles and their mirror images together. The resultant evolution equation in
EPS for a damped harmonic oscillator, is such that the energy dissipated by the
actual oscillator is absorbed in the same rate by the image oscillator leaving
the whole system as a conservative system. We use the EPS formalism to obtain
the dual hamiltonian of a damped harmonic oscillator, first proposed by
Batemann, by a simple extended canonical transformations in the extended phase
space. The extended canonical transformations are capable of converting the
damped system of actual and image oscillators to an undamped one, and transform
the evolution equation into a simple form. The resultant equation is solved and
the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for damped oscillator and its mirror image
are obtained. The results are in agreement with those obtained by Bateman. At
last, the uncertainty relation are examined for above system.

magnetic fields is investigated in this paper. Two different situations have
been studied. We first consider two non-interacting particles. The results show
that because of entanglement, the geometric phase is very different from that
of the non-entangled case. When the initial state is a Werner state, the
geometric phase is, in general, zero and moreover the singularity of the
geometric phase may appear with a proper evolution time. We next study the
geometric phase when intra-couplings appear and choose Werner states as the
initial states to entail this discussion. The results show that unlike our
first case, the absolute value of the GP is not zero, and attains its maximum
when the rescaled coupling constant $J$ is less than 1. The effect of
inhomogeneity of the magnetic field is also discussed.

entanglement between two initially disentangled systems prepared as a tensor
product of thermal states, provided the initial temperature is sufficiently
low. Entanglement is determined by the Peres-Horodeckii criterion, which
establishes that a composite state is entangled if its partial transpose is not
positive. If the initial temperature of the thermal states is higher than an
upper critical value $T_{uc}$ the minimal eigenvalue of the partially
transposed density matrix of the composite state remains positive in the course
of the evolution. If the initial temperature of the thermal states is lower
than a lower critical value $T_{lc}\leq T_{uc}$ the minimal eigenvalue of the
partially transposed density matrix of the composite state becomes negative
which means that entanglement develops. We calculate the lower bound $T_{lb}$
for $T_{lc}$ and show that the negativity of the composite state is negligibly
small in the interval $T_{lb}&lt;T&lt;T_{uc}$. Therefore the lower bound temperature
$T_{lb}$ can be considered as \textit{the} critical temperature for the

the associated stability of the squeezed and anti-squeezed lock points.
Experimental data for the NL technique both in the presence and absence of

first find the trace of powers of the density matrix in a novel fashion, which
involves the correlators of suitable operators in the sine-Gordon model. These,
in turn, can be written exactly in terms of the solutions of non-linear
differential equations of the Painlev\'e V type. Equipped with the previous

expanded in a series of multiple integrals. The previous results have been
checked by direct numerical calculations on the lattice, finding perfect
agreement. Finally, we comment on a possible generalization of the entanglement
entropy c-theorem to the alpha-entropies.

fluctuations of Dirac fields are not essential. In this model the thin film is
presented by a singular background field concentrated on a 2-dimensional

the Casimir force, which appears to be dependent on film material and can be
both attractive and repulsive. We consider also an interaction of plane film
with point charge and straight line current. Here, besides usual results of
classical electrodynamics the model predicts appearance of anomalous electric

the noisy environment. In the optimized scheme the clones' fidelity remains
maximal even in the presence of losses (in the absence of thermal noise), for
propagation times that diverge as the number of modes increases, indicating
that telecloning is a more effective way to distribute quantum information then

only one pure bit of quantum information, along with n qubits in the totally
mixed state. This model, though not as powerful as a pure-state quantum
computer, is capable of performing some computational tasks exponentially
faster than any known classical algorithm. One such task is to estimate with
fixed accuracy the normalized trace of a unitary operator that can be
implemented efficiently in a quantum circuit. We show that circuits of this
type generally lead to entangled states, and we investigate the amount of
entanglement possible in such circuits, as measured by the multiplicative
negativity. We show that the multiplicative negativity is bounded by a
constant, independent of n, for all bipartite divisions of the n+1 qubits, and
so becomes, when n is large, a vanishingly small fraction of the maximum
possible multiplicative negativity for roughly equal divisions. This suggests
that the global nature of entanglement is a more important resource for quantum
computation than the magnitude of the entanglement.

connections with classical mechanics are indirect. In this work I propose a new
and direct connection between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics where
the quantum mechanical propagator is derived from a variational principle. I
identify this variational principle as a generalized form of Hamilton's
principle. This proposed variational principle is unusual because the physical
system is allowed to have imperfect information, i.e., there is incomplete
knowledge of the physical state. Two distribution functionals over possible
generalized momentum paths a[p(t)] and generalized coordinates paths b[q(t)]
are defined. A generalized action is defined that corresponds to a contraction
of a[p(t)], b[q(t)], and a matrix of the action evaluated at all possible p and
q paths. Hamilton's principle is the extremization of the generalized action
over all possible distributions. The normalization of the two distributions
allows their values to be negative and they are shown to be the real and
imaginary parts of the complex amplitude. The amplitude in the Feynman path
integral is shown to be an optimal vector that extremizes the generalized
action. This formulation is also shown to be directly applicable to statistical
mechanics and I show how irreversible behavior and the micro-canonical ensemble
follows immediately.

variable A, are in certain entangled states of another dynamical variable B,
then, for such states, they are also entangled in variable A when distinguished
from each other by variable B. This dualism is independent of quantum
statistics. Departures from identicity of the objects due to arbitrarily small
differences in their innate attributes destroy this dualism. A system
independent scheme to test the dualism is formulated which is readily
realizable with photons. This scheme can be performed without requiring the

qubits collectively interacting with a common thermal environment. We assume
two qubits are initially in Werner state or Werner-like state, and find that
thermal environment can make two qubits become stationary nonlocality. The
analytical relations among average thermal photon number of the environment,
entanglement and nonlocality of two qubits are given in details. It is shown
that the fraction of Bell singlet state plays a key role in the phenomenon that
the common thermal reservoir can enhance the entanglement of two qubits.
Moreover, we find that the collective decay of two qubits in a thermal
reservoir at zero-temperature can generate a stationary maximally entangled
mixed state if only the fraction of Bell singlet state in the initial state is
not smaller than 2/3. It provides us a feasible way to prepare the maximally
entangled mixed state in various physical systems such as the trapped ions,
quantum dots or Josephson Junctions. For the case in which two qutrits
collectively coupled with the thermal reservoir at zero-temperature, we find
that the collective decay can induce the entanglement of two qutrits initially
in the maximally mixed state. The collective decay of two qutrits can also
induce distillable entanglement from the initial conjectured negative partial
transpose bound entangled states.

  in quantum dots</title><description>  Measuring phase in coherent electron systems (mesoscopic systems) provides
ample information not easily revealed by conductance measurements. Phase
measurements in relatively large quantum dots (QDs) recently demonstrated a
universal like phase evolution independent of dot size, shape, and occupancy.
Explicitly, in Coulomb blockaded QDs the transmission phase increased
monotonically by pi throughout each conductance peak, thereafter, in the
conductance valleys the phase returned sharply to its base value. Expected
mesoscopic features in the phase, related to spin degeneracy or to exchange
effects, were never observed. Presently, there is no satisfactory full
explanation for the observed phase universality. Unfortunately, the phase in a
few-electron QDs, where it can be better understood was never measured. Here we
report on such measurements on a small QD that occupy only 1-20 electrons. Such
dot was embedded in one arm of a two path electron interferometer, with an
electron counter near the dot. Unlike the repetitive behavior found in larger
dots we found now mesoscopic features for dot occupation of less than some 10
electrons. An unexpected feature in this regime is a clear observation of the
occupation of two different orbital states by the first two electrons -
contrary to the recent publications. As the occupation increased the phase
evolved and turned universal like for some 14 electrons and higher. The present
measurements allowed us to determine level occupancy and parity. More
importantly, they suggest that QDs go through a phase transition, from
mesoscopic to universal like behavior, as the occupancy increases. These
measurements help in singling out potential few theoretical models among the
many proposed.

conventional quantum representation of our prequantum classical statistical
model is constructed on the basis of the Teylor expansion (up to the terms of
the second order at the vacuum field point $\omega=0)$ of variables $f: \Omega
\to {\bf R}$ with respect to the small parameter $\kappa= \sqrt{h}.$ A Gaussian
symplectically invariant measure (statistical state) is represented by its
covariation operator (von Neumann statistical operator). A symplectically
invariant smooth function (variable) is represented by its second derivative at
the vacuum field point $\omega=0.$ From the statistical viewpoint QM is a
statistical approximation of the prequantum classical statistical field theory
(PCSFT). Such an approximation is obtained through neglecting by statistical
fluctuations of the magnitude $o(h), h\to 0,$ in averages of physical
variables. Equations of Schr\&quot;odinger, Heisenberg and von Neumann are images of
dynamics on $\Omega$ with a symplectically invariant Hamilton function.

schemes in cryptography with the difference that the committing party, say
Alice, is supposed to commit a long string instead of a single bit, to another
party say Bob. Similar to bit commitment schemes, such schemes are supposed to
be binding, i.e Alice cannot change her choice after committing, and concealing
i.e. Bob cannot find Alice's committed string before Alice reveals it.
  Ideal commitment schemes are known to be impossible. Even if some degrees of
cheating is allowed, Buhrman, Christandl, Hayden, Lo and Wehner
(quant-ph/0504078) have recently shown that there are some binding-concealing
trade-offs that any quantum string commitment scheme (QSC) must follow. They
showed trade-offs both in the scenario of single execution of the protocol and
in the asymptotic regime of sufficiently large number of parallel executions of
the protocol.
  We present here new trade-offs in the scenario of single execution of a QSC
protocol. Our trade-offs also immediately imply the trade-off shown by Buhrman
et al. in the asymptotic regime. We show our results by making a central use of
an important information theoretic tool called the substate theorem due to
Jain, Radhakrishnan and Sen. Our techniques are quite different from that of
Buhrman et al. and may be of independent interest.

coincidence measurement, deeply understood and implemented for standard uses.
On the other hand, based on manipulation of entanglement developed for Quantum

quantum efficiency measurement, exploiting polarisation entanglement in
addition to energy-momentum and time ones, that is based on conditioned
polarisation state manipulation. In this review, after a general discussion on

Schrodinger solutions to be related to laboratory experience, such as the Born
rule that connects square modulus to probability. These rules (here called the
sRules) lead to some unacceptable results. They do not allow the primary
observer to be part of the system. They do not allow individual observations
(as opposed to ensembles) to be part of the system. They make a fundamental
distinction between microscopic and macroscopic things, and they are ambiguous
in their description of secondary observers such as Schrodingers cat.
  The nRules are an alternative set of auxiliary rules that avoid the above
difficulties. In this paper we look at a wide range of representative
experiments showing that the nRules adequately relate the Schrodinger solutions
to empirical experience. This suggests that the sRules should be abandoned in
favor of the more satisfactory nRules, or a third auxiliary rule-set called the
oRules. Keywords: brain states, consciousness, decoherence, epistemology,

  approach</title><description>  In this theoretical paper, we investigate coherence properties of the
near-resonant light scattered by two atoms exposed to a strong monochromatic
field. To properly incorporate saturation effects, we use a quantum Langevin
approach. In contrast to the standard optical Bloch equations, this method
naturally provides the inelastic spectrum of the radiated light induced by the
quantum electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations. However, to get the right spectral
properties of the scattered light, it is essential to correctly describe the
statistical properties of these vacuum fluctuations. Because of the presence of
the two atoms, these statistical properties are not Gaussian : (i) the spatial
two-points correlation function displays a speckle-like behavior and (ii) the
three-points correlation function does not vanish. We also explain how to
incorporate in a simple way propagation with a frequency-dependent scattering
mean-free path, meaning that the two atoms are embedded in an average
scattering dispersive medium. Finally we show that saturation-induced
nonlinearities strongly modify the atomic scattering properties and, as a
consequence, provide a source of decoherence in multiple scattering. This is
exemplified by considering the coherent backscattering configuration where
interference effects are blurred by this decoherence mechanism. This leads to a
decrease of the so-called coherent backscattering enhancement factor.

  Memories</title><description>  The most general method for encoding quantum information is not to encode the
information into a subspace of a Hilbert space, but to encode information into
a subsystem of a Hilbert space. Recently this notion has led to a more general
notion of quantum error correction known as operator quantum error correction.
In standard quantum error correcting codes, one requires the ability to apply a
procedure which exactly reverses on the error correcting subspace any
correctable error. In contrast, for operator error correcting subsystems, the
correction procedure need not undo the error which has occurred, but instead
one must perform correction only modulo the subsystem structure. This does not
lead to codes which differ from subspace codes, but does lead to recovery
routines which explicitly make use of the subsystem structure. Here we present
two examples of such operator error correcting subsystems. These examples are
motivated by simple spatially local Hamiltonians on square and cubic lattices.
In three dimensions we provide evidence, in the form a simple mean field
theory, that our Hamiltonian gives rise to a system which is self-correcting.
Such a system will be a natural high-temperature quantum memory, robust to
noise without external intervening quantum error correction procedures.

Locality has elevated Quantum Mechanics to the level of an &quot;Operational
Epistemic Theory&quot;. In such context the quantum superposition principle has an
extraneous non epistemic nature. This leads us to seek purely operational
foundations for Quantum Mechanics, from which to derive the current
mathematical axiomatization based on Hilbert spaces.
  In the present work I present a set of axioms of purely operational nature,
based on a general definition of &quot;the experiment&quot;, the operational/epistemic
archetype of information retrieval from reality. As we will see, this starting
point logically entails a series of notions [state, conditional state, local
state, pure state, faithful state, instrument, propensity (i.e. &quot;effect&quot;),
dynamical and informational equivalence, dynamical and informational
compatibility, predictability, discriminability, programmability, locality,
a-causality, rank of the state, maximally chaotic state, maximally entangled
state, informationally complete propensity, etc. ], along with a set of rules
(addition, convex combination, partial orderings, ...), which, far from being
of quantum origin as often considered, instead constitute the universal
&quot;syntactic manual&quot; of the operational/epistemic approach. The missing
ingredient is, of course, the quantum superposition axiom for probability
amplitudes: for this I propose some substitute candidates of purely
operational/epistemic nature.

  the Classical System of SU(2) and SU(1,1) Arising from Quantum Optics</title><description>  This is a challenging paper including some review and new results.
  Since the non-commutative version of the classical system based on the
compact group SU(2) has been constructed in (quant-ph/0502174) by making use of
Jaynes-Commings model and so-called Quantum Diagonalization Method in
(quant-ph/0502147), we construct a non-commutative version of the classical
system based on the non-compact group SU(1,1) by modifying the compact case.
  In this model the Hamiltonian is not hermite but pseudo hermite, which causes
a big difference between two models. For example, in the classical
representation theory of SU(1,1), unitary representations are infinite
dimensional from the starting point. Therefore, to develop a unitary theory of
non-commutative system of SU(1,1) we need an infinite number of non-commutative
systems, which means a kind of {\bf second non-commutativization}. This is a
very hard and interesting problem.
  We develop a corresponding theory though it is not always enough, and present
some challenging problems concerning how classical properties can be extended
to the non-commutative case.
  This paper is arranged for the convenience of readers as the first subsection
is based on the standard model (SU(2) system) and the next one is based on the
non-standard model (SU(1,1) system). This contrast may make the similarity and
difference between the standard and non-standard models clear.

  in graininess and shape of the bodies</title><description>  In ``Decoherence of macroscopic closed systems within Newtonian quantum
gravity'' (Kay B S 1998 Class. Quantum Grav. 15 L89-L98) it was argued that,
given a many-body Schroedinger wave function \psi(x_1,...,x_N) for the
centre-of-mass degrees of freedom of a closed system of N identical
uniform-mass balls of mass M and radius R, taking account of quantum
gravitational effects and then tracing over the gravitational field amounts to
multiplying the position-space density matrix \rho(x_1,...,x_N; x_1',...,x_N')=
\psi(x_1,...,x_N)\psi*(x_1',...,x_N') by a multiplicative factor, which, if the
positions {x_1,...,x_N; x_1',...,x_N'} are all much further away from one
another than R, is well-approximated by the product from 1 to N over I, J, K
(I&lt;J) of ((|x_K-x_K'|/R)(|x_I'-x_J||x_I-x_J'|/|x_I-x_J||x_I'-x_J'|))^{-24M^2}.
Here we show that if each uniform-mass ball is replaced by a grainy ball or
more general-shaped lump of similar size consisting of a number, n, of
well-spaced small balls of mass m and radius r and, in the above formula, R is
replaced by r, M by m and the products are taken over all Nn positions of all
the small balls, then the result is well-approximated by replacing R in the
original formula by a new value R_eff. This suggests that the original formula
will apply in general to physically realistic lumps -- be they macroscopic
lumps of ordinary matter with the grains atomic nuclei etc. or be they atomic
nuclei themselves with their own (quantum) grainy substructure -- provided R is
chosen suitably. In the case of a cubical lump consisting of n=(2L+1)^3 small
balls (L &gt; 0) of radius r with centres at the vertices of a cubic lattice of
spacing a (assumed to be very much bigger than 2r) and side 2La we establish
the bound e^{-1/3}(r/a)^{1/n}La &lt; R_eff &lt; 2\sqrt 3(r/a)^{1/n} La.

  Systems</title><description>  Quantum entanglement of pure states of a bipartite system is defined as the
amount of local or marginal ({\em i.e.}referring to the subsystems) entropy.
For mixed states this identification vanishes, since the global loss of
information about the state makes it impossible to distinguish between quantum
and classical correlations. Here we show how the joint knowledge of the global
and marginal degrees of information of a quantum state, quantified by the
purities or in general by information entropies, provides an accurate
characterization of its entanglement. In particular, for Gaussian states of
continuous variable systems, we classify the entanglement of two--mode states
according to their degree of total and partial mixedness, comparing the
different roles played by the purity and the generalized $p-$entropies in
quantifying the mixedness and bounding the entanglement. We prove the existence
of strict upper and lower bounds on the entanglement and the existence of
extremally (maximally and minimally) entangled states at fixed global and
marginal degrees of information. This results allow for a powerful, operative
method to measure mixed-state entanglement without the full tomographic
reconstruction of the state. Finally, we briefly discuss the ongoing extension
of our analysis to the quantification of multipartite entanglement in highly
symmetric Gaussian states of arbitrary $1 \times N$-mode partitions.

  I. Calculation of phase shift and Jost function</title><description>  Elegant and mathematically rigorous methods of the quantum inverse theory are
difficult to put into practice because there is always some lack of needful
input information. In this situation, one may try to construct a reference
potential, whose spectral characteristics would be in a reasonable agreement
with the available data of the system's properties. Since the reference
potential is fixed, it is always possible to calculate all its spectral
characteristics, including phase shift for scattering states and Jost function,
the main key to solve the inverse problem. Thereafter, one can calculate a
Bargmann potential whose Jost function differs from the initial one only by a
rational factor. This way it is possible, at least in principle, to construct a
more reliable potential for the system. The model system investigated in this
paper is diatomic xenon molecule in ground electronic state. Its reference
potential is built up of several smoothly joined Morse type components, which
enables to solve the related energy eigenvalue problem exactly. Moreover, the
phase shift can also be calculated in part analytically, and the Jost function
can be acertained very accurately in the whole range of positive energies. Full
energy dependence of the phase shift has been determined and its excellent
agreement with the Levinson theorem demonstrated. In addition, asymptotically
exact analytic formulas for the phase shift and the Jost function, independent
of each other, are obtained and their physical background elucidated.

described locally where possible. Because the network quantum state is in
general entangled, we need to model it as a global structure, reminiscent of
global memory in classical agent systems. Local quantum computations are
described as measurement patterns. Since measurement-based quantum computation
is inherently distributed, this allows us to extend naturally several concepts
of the measurement calculus, a formal model for such computations. Our goal is
to define an assembly language, i.e. we assume that computations are
well-defined and we do not concern ourselves with verification techniques. The
operational semantics for systems of agents is given by a probabilistic
transition system, and we define operational equivalence in a way that it
corresponds to the notion of bisimilarity. With this in place, we prove that
teleportation is bisimilar to a direct quantum channel, and this also within

experiments they describe, I clarify relations among some purely mathematical
entities featured in quantum mechanics (probabilities, density operators,
partial traces, and operator-valued measures), thereby allowing applications of
these entities to the modeling of a wider variety of physical situations.
Conditional probabilities associated with projection-valued measures are
expressed by introducing conditional density operators, identical in some but
not all cases to the usual reduced density operators. By lifting density
operators to the extended Hilbert space featured in Neumark's theorem, I show
an obstacle to extending conditional density operators to arbitrary positive
operator-valued measures (POVMs); however, tensor products of POVMs are
compatible with conditional density operators. By way of application,
conditional density operators together with the free choice of probe particles
allow the so-called postulate of state reductions to be replaced by a theorem.
A second application demonstrates an equivalence between one form of quantum
key distribution and another, allowing a formulation of individual
eavesdropping attacks against transmitted-state BB84 to work also for
entangled-state BB84.

employed whereby $\L$ Bell state measurements are made and information based on
these measurements is sent via a classical channel to the recipient. Upon
receiving this information the recipient determines a local gate which is used
to recover the original state. We find that the $2^{2\L}$-dimensional Hilbert
space of states available for the channel admits a decomposition into four
subspaces. Every state within a given subspace is a perfect channel, and each
sequence of Bell measurements projects $2\L$ qubits of the system into one of
the four subspaces. As a result, only two bits of classical information need be
sent to the recipient for them to determine the gate. We note some connections
between these four subspaces and ground states of many-body Hamiltonian
systems, and discuss the implications of these results towards understanding

Finally, we discover that the classical limit of quantum mechanics is classical

importance to the philosophy of physics, and any interpretation of quantum
mechanics has to clarify it. Our discussion of this relationship is partly
historical and conceptual, but mostly technical and mathematically rigorous,
including over 500 references. On the assumption that quantum mechanics is
universal and complete, we discuss three ways in which classical physics has so
far been believed to emerge from quantum physics, namely in the limit h -&gt; 0 of
small Planck's constant (in a finite system), in the limit of a large system,
and through decoherence and consistent histores. The first limit is closely
related to modern quantization theory and microlocal analysis, whereas the
second involves methods of C*-algebras and the concepts of superselection
sectors and macroscopic observables. In these limits, the classical world does
not emerge as a sharply defined objective reality, but rather as an approximate
appearance relative to certain &quot;classical&quot; states and observables. Decoherence
subsequently clarifies the role of such states, in that they are &quot;einselected&quot;,
i.e. robust against coupling to the environment. Furthermore, the nature of
classical observables is elucidated by the fact that they typically define
(approximately) consistent sets of histories. We make the point that
classicality results from the elimination of certain states and observables
from quantum theory. Thus the classical world is not created by observation (as
Heisenberg once claimed), but rather by the lack of it.

wavefunctions in space is the violation of the principle of energy
conservation. In the models proposed in the literature the stochastic field
which is responsible for the localization mechanism causes the momentum to
behave like a Brownian motion, whose larger and larger fluctuations show up as
a steady increase of the energy of the system. In spite of the fact that, in
all situations, such an increase is small and practically undetectable, it is
an undesirable feature that the energy of physical systems is not conserved but
increases constantly in time, diverging for $t \to \infty$. In this paper we
show that this property of collapse models can be modified: we propose a model
of spontaneous wavefunction collapse sharing all most important features of
usual models but such that the energy of isolated systems reaches an asymptotic
finite value instead of increasing with a steady rate.

gives rise to a collection of m Cartan subalgebras of the special linear Lie
algebra sl_n(K) that are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the Killing form,
where K=R or K=C. In particular, a complete collection of MUBs in C^n gives
rise to a so-called orthogonal decomposition (OD) of sl_n(C). The converse
holds if the Cartan subalgebras in the OD are also *-closed, i.e., closed under
the adjoint operation. In this case, the Cartan subalgebras have unitary bases,
and the above correspondence becomes equivalent to a result relating
collections of MUBs to collections of maximal commuting classes of unitary
error bases, i.e., orthogonal unitary matrices.
  It is a longstanding conjecture that ODs of sl_n(C) can only exist if n is a
prime power. This corroborates further the general belief that a complete
collection of MUBs can only exist in prime power dimensions. The connection to
ODs of sl_n(C) potentially allows the application of known results on (partial)

precisely controlled and adjusted using a standing-wave dipole-force trap, a
challenge for strong atom-cavity coupling. Ultracold Rubidium atoms are first
loaded into potential minima of the dipole trap in the center of the cavity.
Then we use the trap as a conveyor belt that we set into motion perpendicular
to the cavity axis. This allows us to repetitively move atoms out of and back
into the cavity mode with a repositioning precision of 135 nm. This makes
possible to either selectively address one atom of a string of atoms by the
cavity, or to simultaneously couple two precisely separated atoms to a higher
mode of the cavity.

has bearings on many broader issues in the foundations of quantum mechanics as
well. In this scenario a quantum measurement is a non-equilibrium phase
transition in a ``resonant cavity'' formed by the entire physical universe
including all of its material and energy content. A quantum measurement
involves the energy and matter exchange among not only the system being
measured and the measuring apparatus but also the global environment of the
universe resonant cavity, which together constrain the nature of the phase
transition. Strict realism, including strict energy and angular momentum
conservation, is recovered in this view of the quantum measurement process
beyond the limit set by the uncertainty relations, which are themselves derived
from the exact commutation relations for quantum conjugate variables. Both the
amplitude and the phase of the quantum mechanical wavefunction acquire
substantial meanings in the new ontology, and the probabilistic element is
removed from the foundations of quantum mechanics, its apparent presence in the
quantum measurement being solely a result of the sensitive dependence on
initial/boundary conditions of the phase transitions of a many
degree-of-freedom system which is effectively the whole universe. Vacuum
fluctuations are viewed as the ``left over'' fluctuations after forming the
whole numbers of nonequilibrium resonant modes in the universe cavity. This new
view on the quantum processes helps to clarify many puzzles in the foundations
of quantum mechanics.

allow for trap geometries with microwave cut-off frequencies high enough to
inhibit the spontaneous emission of the Rydberg atom, paving the way to
complete control of both external and internal degrees of freedom over very
long times. Trapping is achieved using carefully designed electric fields,
created by a simple pattern of electrodes. We show that it is possible to
excite, and then trap, one and only one Rydberg atom from a cloud of ground
state atoms confined on a magnetic atom chip, itself integrated with the
Rydberg trap. Distinct internal states of the atom are simultaneously trapped,
providing us with a two-level system extremely attractive for atom-surface and
atom-atom interaction studies. We describe a method for reducing by three
orders of magnitude dephasing due to Stark shifts, induced by the trapping
field, of the internal transition frequency. This allows for, in combination
with spin-echo techniques, maintenance of an internal coherence over times in
the second range. This method operates via a controlled light shift rendering
the two internal states' Stark shifts almost identical. We thoroughly identify
and account for sources of imperfection in order to verify at each step the

in principle, zero probability of damaging the nascent graph state. We avoid
the finite thresholds of other schemes by operating on two entangled pairs, so
that each generates exactly one photon. We do not require the relatively slow
single qubit local flips to be applied during the growth phase: growth of the
graph state can then become a purely optical process. The scheme naturally
generates graph states with vertices of high degree and so is easily able to

deterministic predictions for individual systems. Exact analytical results are
obtained for the quantum and the Liouvillian dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator
coupled to a phase-damping reservoir at a finite temperature. In this context,
the time of critical wave function spreading - the Ehrenfest time - emerges as
the characteristic time scale within which the concept of deterministic
behavior is admissible in physics. A scenario of &quot;quasi-determinism&quot; may be
then defined within which the motion is experimentally indistinguishable from
the truly deterministic motion of Newtonian mechanics. Beyond this time scale,
predictions for individual systems can be given only statistically and, in this
case, it is shown that diffusive decoherence is indeed a necessary ingredient
to establish the quantum-classical correspondence. Moreover, the
high-temperature regime is shown to be an additional condition for the
quantum-classical transition and, accordingly, a lower bound for the reservoir
temperature is derived for our model.

superradiance. Their similarities and distinctions are emphasized. It is shown
that, despite a close analogy, these phenomena are fundamentally different. In
atomic systems, superradiance is a self-organized process, in which both the
initial cause, being spontaneous emission, as well as the collectivizing
mechanism of their interactions through the common radiation field, are of the
same physical nature. Contrary to this, in actual spin systems with dipole
interactions, the latter are the major reason for spin motion. Electromagnetic
spin interactions through radiation are negligible and can never produce
collective effects. The possibility of realizing superradiance in molecular
magnets by coupling them to a resonant circuit is discussed.

coupled to a quantum environment with a specific degeneracy structure. The
reduced dynamics of the whole spin-chain as well as of single spins is
analyzed. We show, that the total spin-chain relaxes to a thermal equilibrium
state independently of the internal interaction strength. In contrast, the
asymptotic states of each individual spin are thermal for weak but non-thermal
for stronger spin-spin coupling. The transition between both scenarios is found
for couplings of the order of $0.1 \times \Delta E$, with $\Delta E$ denoting
the Zeeman-splitting. We compare these results with a master equation
treatment; when time averaged, both approaches lead to the same asymptotic

conducting walls are studied. The mathematical model of &quot;inert&quot; ideal-conductor
walls, considered in the original formulations of the Casimir effect, is based
on the universal properties of the electromagnetic radiation in the vacuum
between the conductors, with zero boundary conditions for the tangential
components of the electric field on the walls. This formulation seems to be in
agreement with experiments on metallic conductors at room temperature. At high
temperatures or large distances, at least, fluctuations of the electric field
are present in the bulk and at the surface of a particle system forming the
walls, even in the high-density limit: &quot;living&quot; ideal conductors. This makes
the enforcement of the inert boundary conditions inadequate. Within a hierarchy
of length scales, the high-temperature Casimir force is shown to be entirely
determined by the thermal fluctuations in the conducting walls, modelled
microscopically by classical Coulomb fluids in the Debye-H\&quot;{u}ckel regime. The
semi-classical regime, in the framework of quantum electrodynamics, is studied

in which Arthur and Merlin can perform quantum computations and Merlin can send
Arthur quantum information. As in the classical case, messages from Arthur to
Merlin are restricted to be strings of uniformly generated random bits. It is
proved that for one-message quantum Arthur-Merlin games, which correspond to
the complexity class QMA, completeness and soundness errors can be reduced
exponentially without increasing the length of Merlin's message. Previous
constructions for reducing error required a polynomial increase in the length
of Merlin's message. Applications of this fact include a proof that logarithmic
length quantum certificates yield no increase in power over BQP and a simple
proof that QMA is contained in PP. Other facts that are proved include the
equivalence of three (or more) message quantum Arthur-Merlin games with
ordinary quantum interactive proof systems and some basic properties concerning
two-message quantum Arthur-Merlin games.

  Long-Range Interactions</title><description>  We have performed a precise experimental determination of the Casimir
pressure between two gold-coated parallel plates by means of a micromachined
oscillator. In contrast to all previous experiments on the Casimir effect,
where a small relative error (varying from 1% to 15%) was achieved only at the
shortest separation, our smallest experimental error ($\sim 0.5$%) is achieved
over a wide separation range from 170 nm to 300 nm at 95% confidence. We have
formulated a rigorous metrological procedure for the comparison of experiment
and theory without resorting to the previously used root-mean-square deviation,
which has been criticized in the literature. This enables us to discriminate
among different competing theories of the thermal Casimir force, and to resolve
a thermodynamic puzzle arising from the application of Lifshitz theory to real
metals. Our results lead to a more rigorous approach for obtaining constraints
on hypothetical long-range interactions predicted by extra-dimensional physics
and other extensions of the Standard Model. In particular, the constraints on
non-Newtonian gravity are strengthened by up to a factor of 20 in a wide
interaction range at 95% confidence.

  two-mode Gaussian states</title><description>  In this work we focus on entanglement of two--mode Gaussian states of
continuous variable systems. We first review the formalism of Gaussian measures
of entanglement, adopting the framework developed in [M. M. Wolf {\em et al.},
Phys. Rev. A {\bf 69}, 052320 (2004)], where the Gaussian entanglement of
formation was defined. We compute Gaussian measures explicitely for two
important families of nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian states, namely the states
of extremal (maximal and minimal) negativities at fixed global and local
purities, introduced in [G. Adesso {\em et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 92},
087901 (2004)]. This allows us to compare the {\em orderings} induced on the
set of entangled two--mode Gaussian states by the negativities and by the
Gaussian entanglement measures. We find that in a certain range of global and
local purities (characterizing the covariance matrix of the corresponding
extremal states), states of minimum negativity can have more Gaussian
entanglement than states of maximum negativity. Thus Gaussian measures and
negativities are definitely inequivalent on nonsymmetric two--mode Gaussian
states (even when restricted to extremal states), while they are completely
equivalent on symmetric states, where moreover the Gaussian entanglement of
formation coincides with the true one. However, the inequivalence between these
two families of continuous-variable entanglement measures is somehow limited.
In fact we show rigorously that, at fixed negativities, the Gaussian
entanglement measures are bounded from below, and we provide strong evidence
that they are also bounded from above.

an assertion about the degrees of freedom of the matter (\emph{i.e} non
gravitational) fields; those, say for definiteness, of the Standard Model of
particle physics. As for any quantum theory, the dynamics of the matter fields
can be described in terms of a unitary evolution of a state vector in a Hilbert
space. By writing the Hilbert space as a generic tensor product of &quot;subsystems&quot;
we analyse the evolution of a state vector on an information theoretical basis
and attempt to recover the usual space-time relations from the information
exchanges between these subsystems. We consider generic interacting second
quantized models with a finite number of fermionic degrees of freedom and
characterize on physical grounds the tensor product structure associated with
the class of &quot;localized systems&quot; and therefore with &quot;position&quot;. We find that in
the case of free theories no space-time relation is operationally definable. On
the contrary, by applying the same procedure to the simple interacting model of

usually associated with &quot;position&quot;. Finally, we discuss the possible role of

with d the dimension of the finite Hilbert space, are becoming more and more
studied for applications such as quantum tomography and cryptography, and in
relation to entangled states and to the Heisenberg-Weil group of quantum

power dimensions d=p^m using the tools of abstract algebra. Presumably, for non
prime dimensions the cardinality is much less. Here we reinterpret MUBs as
quantum phase states, i.e. as eigenvectors of Hermitean phase operators
generalizing those introduced by Pegg &amp; Barnett in 1989. We relate MUB states
to additive characters of Galois fields (in odd characteristic p) and to Galois
rings (in characteristic 2). Quantum Fourier transforms of the components in
vectors of the bases define a more general class of MUBs with multiplicative
characters and additive ones altogether. We investigate the complementary
properties of the above phase operator with respect to the number operator. We
also study the phase probability distribution and variance for general pure
quantum electromagnetic states and find them to be related to the Gauss sums,
which are sums over all elements of the field (or of the ring) of the product
of multiplicative and additive characters. Finally, we relate the concepts of
mutual unbiasedness and maximal entanglement. This allows to use well studied
algebraic concepts as efficient tools in the study of entanglement and its

including its discrete energy spectrum, the full energy dependence of the phase
shift, and the Jost function, are expected to be known. The technically most
complicated task in ascertaining the potential, solution of a relevant integral
equation, has been decomposed into two relatively independent problems. First,
one uses Krein method to calculate an auxiliary potential with exactly the same
spectral density as the initial reference potential, but with no bound states.
Thereafter, using Gelfand-Levitan method, it is possible to introduce, one by
one, all bound states, along with calculating another auxiliary potential of
the same spectral density at each step. For the system under study (diatomic
xenon molecule), the kernel of the Krein integral equation can be accurately
ascertained with the help of solely analytic means. At small distances the
calculated auxiliary potential with no bound states practically coincides with
the initial reference potential, which is in full agreement with general
theoretical considerations. Several possibilities of solving the Krein equation

  Compact Closure</title><description>  Elaborating on our joint work with Abramsky in quant-ph/0402130 we further
unravel the linear structure of Hilbert spaces into several constituents. Some
prove to be very crucial for particular features of quantum theory while others
obstruct the passage to a formalism which is not saturated with physically
insignificant global phases.
  First we show that the bulk of the required linear structure is purely
multiplicative, and arises from the strongly compact closed tensor which,
besides providing a variety of notions such as scalars, trace, unitarity,
self-adjointness and bipartite projectors, also provides Hilbert-Schmidt norm,
Hilbert-Schmidt inner-product, and in particular, the preparation-state
agreement axiom which enables the passage from a formalism of the vector space
kind to a rather projective one, as it was intended in the (in)famous Birkhoff
&amp; von Neumann paper.
  Next we consider additive types which distribute over the tensor, from which
measurements can be build, and the correctness proofs of the protocols
discussed in quant-ph/0402130 carry over to the resulting weaker setting. A
full probabilistic calculus is obtained when the trace is moreover linear and
satisfies the \em diagonal axiom, which brings us to a second main result,
characterization of the necessary and sufficient additive structure of a both
qualitatively and quantitatively effective categorical quantum formalism
without redundant global phases. Along the way we show that if in a category a
(additive) monoidal tensor distributes over a strongly compact closed tensor,
then this category is always enriched in commutative monoids.

nearest neighbors are of XX, YY or ZZ type, depending on the direction of the
link; different types of interactions may differ in strength. The model is
solved exactly by a reduction to free fermions in a static $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$
gauge field. A phase diagram in the parameter space is obtained. One of the
phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The
other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field.
In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules
coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a
general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized
by a spectral Chern number $\nu$. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the
original model correspond to $\nu=0$ and $\nu=\pm 1$, respectively. The anyonic
properties of excitation depend on $\nu\bmod 16$, whereas $\nu$ itself governs
edge thermal transport. The paper also provides mathematical background on
anyons as well as an elementary theory of Chern number for quasidiagonal
matrices.

  states</title><description>  General semiclassical expression for quantum fidelity (Loschmidt echo) of
arbitrary pure and mixed states is derived. It expresses fidelity as an
interference sum of dephasing trajectories weighed by the Wigner function of
the initial state, and does not require that the initial state be localized in
position or momentum. This general dephasing representation is special in that,
counterintuitively, all of fidelity decay is due to dephasing and none due to
the decay of classical overlaps. Surprising accuracy of the approximation is
justified by invoking the shadowing theorem: twice--both for physical
perturbations and for numerical errors. It is shown how the general expression
reduces to the special forms for position and momentum states and for wave
packets localized in position or momentum. The superiority of the general over
the specialized forms is explained and supported by numerical tests for wave
packets, non-local pure states, and for simple and random mixed states. The
tests are done in non-universal regimes in mixed phase space where detailed
features of fidelity are important. Although semiclassically motivated, present
approach is valid for abstract systems with a finite Hilbert basis provided
that the discrete Wigner transform is used. This makes the method applicable,
via a phase space approach, e. g., to problems of quantum computation.

studied before by several methods: Gaussian variational approximation, the
method of moments, method of modulated Townes soliton, and the direct averaging
of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. We summarize these methods and find that
the numerically obtained stabilized solution has different configuration than
that assumed by the theoretical methods (in particular a phase of the
wavefunction is not quadratic with $r$). We show that there is presently no
clear evidence for stabilization in a strict sense, because in the numerical
experiments only metastable (slowly decaying) solutions have been obtained. In
other words, neither numerical nor mathematical evidence for a new kind of
soliton solutions have been revealed so far. The existence of the metastable
solutions is nevertheless an interesting and complicated phenomenon on its own.
We try some non-Gaussian variational trial functions to obtain better

stochastic differential equations. This makes these strongly nonequilibrium
processes principally different from the spin relaxation close to an

consideration is based on a realistic microscopic Hamiltonian including the
Zeeman terms, dipole interactions, exchange interactions, and a single-site
anisotropy. The influence of cross correlations between several spin species is
investigated. The critically important function of coupling between the spin
system and a resonant electric circuit is emphasized. The role of all main

coherence in spin motion, from the quantum chaotic stage of incoherent

the same energy expectation value must be realised with equal probability. The

closed-form expression for the density of states associated with any system

a one-to-one correspondence between an area-law scaling of the bi-partite
entanglement and a finite correlation length. This relation is strict in the
one-dimensional case and there is strog evidence for the multi-dimensional
case. We also discuss generalizations to couplings with infinite range.
Finally, to illustrate our results, a specific 1D example with nearest and
next-nearest neighbor coupling is analyzed.

of quantum information theory which predicts many fascinating phenomena and
provides new physical resources. A basic problem is to recognize the features
of quantum systems responsible for those phenomena. One of such important
features is that non-commuting quantum states cannot be broadcast: two copies
cannot be obtained out of a single copy, not even reproduced marginally on
separate systems. We focus on the difference of information contents between
one copy and two copies which is a basic manifestation of the gap between
quantum and classical information. We show that if the chosen information
measure is the Holevo quantity, the difference between the information contents
of one copy and two copies is zero if and only if the states can be broadcast.
We propose a new approach in defining measures of quantumness of ensembles
based on the difference of information contents between the original ensemble
and the ensemble of duplicated states. We comment about the permanence property
of quantum states and the recently introduced superbroadcasting operation. We
also provide an Appendix where we discuss the status of quantum information in
quantum physics, basing on the so-called isomorphism principle.

reality requires an unambiguous specification of the ensemble of realizable
states (and each state's probability of realization). Although not yet achieved
within the framework of standard quantum theory, it has been achieved within
the framework of the Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) wave function
collapse model. In this paper, I consider a previously presented model, which
is predictively equivalent to CSL. In this Completely Quantized Collapse (CQC)
model, the classical random field which causes collapse in CSL is quantized.
The ensemble of realizable states is described by a single state vector, the
&quot;ensemble vector,&quot; the sum of the direct product of an eigenstate of the
quantized field and the CSL state corresponding to that eigenstate. Using this
description, a long standing problem is resolved: it is shown how to define
energy of the random field and its energy of interaction with particles so that
total energy is conserved for the ensemble of realizable states. As a
byproduct, since the random field energy spectrum is unbounded, its canonical
conjugate, a self-adjoint time operator, is discussed. Finally, CSL is a
phenomenological description, whose connection to, or derivation from, more
conventional physics has not yet appeared. We suggest that, because CQC is
fully quantized, it is a natural framework for replacement of the classical
field of CSL by a quantized physical entity. Two illustrative examples are
given.

  entanglement monotones</title><description>  Much of the theory of entanglement concerns the transformations that are
possible to a state under local operations with classical communication (LOCC);
however, this set of operations is complicated and difficult to describe
mathematically. An idea which has proven very useful is that of the {\it
entanglement monotone}: a function of the state which is invariant under local
unitary transformations and always decreases (or increases) on average after
any local operation. In this paper we look on LOCC as the set of operations
generated by {\it infinitesimal local operations}, operations which can be
performed locally and which leave the state little changed. We show that a
necessary and sufficient condition for a function of the state to be an
entanglement monotone under local operations that do not involve information
loss is that the function be a monotone under infinitesimal local operations.
We then derive necessary and sufficient differential conditions for a function
of the state to be an entanglement monotone. We first derive two conditions for
local operations without information loss, and then show that they can be
extended to more general operations by adding the requirement of {\it
convexity}. We then demonstrate that a number of known entanglement monotones
satisfy these differential criteria. Finally, as an application, we use the
differential conditions to construct a new polynomial entanglement monotone for
three-qubit pure states. It is our hope that this approach will avoid some of
the difficulties in the theory of multipartite and mixed-state entanglement.

perform measurements on systems they hold locally. We restrict ourselves to
those correlations with which arbitrarily fast transmission of information is
impossible. These correlations are called nonsignaling. We allow the
measurements to be chosen from sets of an arbitrary size, but promise that each
measurement has only two possible outcomes. We find the structure of this
convex set of nonsignaling correlations by characterizing its extreme points.
Taking an information-theoretic view, we prove that all of these extreme
correlations are interconvertible. This suggests that the simplest extremal
nonlocal distribution (called a PR box) might be the basic unit of nonlocality.
We also show that this unit of nonlocality is sufficient to simulate all
quantum states when measured with two outcome measurements.

consequence regular classical dynamics can in certain circumstances be

proofs, discussion and examples are provided of the main results. Namely, we
demonstrate that all quantum cryptographic protocols can be recast in a way
which looks like entanglement theory, with the only change being that instead
of distilling EPR pairs, the parties distill private states. The form of these
general private states are given, and we show that there are a number of useful
ways of expressing them. Some of the private states can be approximated by
certain states which are bound entangled. Thus distillable entanglement is not
a requirement for a private key. We find that such bound entangled states are
useful for a cryptographic primitive we call a controlled private quantum
channel. We also find a general class of states which have negative partial

entropy distance is shown to be an upper bound on the rate of key. This allows
us to compute the exact value of distillable key for a certain class of private

noncommutative coordinates. We shall first see that the noncommutativity
modifies the exchange correlation energy while preserving the electric
neutrality of the model. By employing time-independent perturbation theory
together with the Seiberg-Witten map we show, afterwards, that the ionization

A Green's function formalism is developed which accounts for the full 3D nature

weakly localized states, whose binding energies and wavefunctions can be

trace-preserving map, when the infimum of S(gamma_{12}) - S(gamma_1) is
restricted to states of the form gamma_{12} = (I \ot Phi)(| psi &gt;&lt; psi |). We
show that this follows from multiplicativity of the completely bounded norm of
Phi considered as a map from L_1 -&gt; L_p for L_p spaces defined by the Schatten
p-norm on matrices; we also give an independent proof based on entropy
inequalities. Several related multiplicativity results are discussed and
proved. In particular, we show that both the usual L_1 -&gt; L_p norm of a CP map
and the corresponding completely bounded norm are achieved for positive
semi-definite matrices. Physical interpretations are considered, and a new
proof of strong subadditivity is presented.

Markovian noise. These assumptions are: fast gates, a constant supply of fresh

may not be mutually consistent in light of rigorous formulations of the

singular coupling limit (high temperature), or the weak coupling limit (weak

  amplitude in the Aharonov-Bohm ring</title><description>  A characterization of the two-terminal open-ring Aharonov-Bohm interferometer
is made by analyzing the phase space plots in the complex transmission
amplitude plane. Two types of plots are considered: type I plot which uses the
magnetic flux as the variable parameter and type II plot which uses the
electron momentum as the variable parameter. In type I plot, the trajectory
closes upon itself only when the ratio $R$ of the arm lengths (of the
interferometer) is a rational fraction, the shape and the type of the generated
flower-like pattern is sensitive to the electron momentum. For momenta
corresponding to discrete eigenstates of the perfect ring (i.e. the ring
without the leads), the trajectory passes through the origin a certain fixed
number of times before closing upon itself, whereas for arbitrary momenta it
never passes through the origin. Although the transmission coefficient is
periodic in the flux with the elementary flux quantum as the basic period, the
phenomenon of electron transmission is shown not to be so when analyzed via the
present technique. The periodicity is seen to spread over several flux units
whenever $R$ is a rational fraction whereas there is absolutely no periodicity
present when $R$ is an irrational number. In type II plot, closed trajectories
passing through the origin a number of times are seen for $R$ being a rational
fraction. The case R=1 (i.e. a symmetric ring) with zero flux is rather
pathological--it presents a closed loop surrounding the origin. For irrational
$R$ values, the trajectories never close.

quantum entanglement in the composite state when the photonic band gap is
exhibited by the presence of photonic crystals in a three-level system. An
analytic approach is proposed for any three-level system in the presence of
photonic band gap. Using this analytic solution, we conclusively calculate the
concurrence and phase entropy, focusing particularly on the entanglement
phenomena. Specifically, we use concurrence as a measure of entanglement for
dipole emitters situated in the thin slab region between two semi-infinite
one-dimensionally periodic photonic crystals, a situation reminiscent of planar
cavity laser structures. One feature of the regime considered here is that
closed-form evaluation of the time evolution may be carried out in the presence
of the detuning and the photonic band gap, which provides insight into the
difference in the nature of the concurrence function for atom-field coupling,
mode frequency and different cavity parameters. We demonstrate how fluctuations
in the phase and number entropies effected by the presence of the
photonic-band-gap. The outcomes are illustrated with numerical simulations
applied to GaAs. Finally, we relate the obtained results to instances of any
three-level system for which the entanglement cost can be calculated. Potential
experimental observations in solid-state systems are discussed and found to be
promising.

confined as a soliton wave by the principle of causality of special relativity.
The soliton travels rectilinearly at the speed of light. The solution can
represent any of the known polarization (spin) states of the photon. For
circularly polarized states the soliton's envelope is a circular ellipsoid
whose length is the observed wavelength ($\lambda$), and whose diameter is
$\lambda/\pi$; this envelope contains the electromagnetic energy of the wave
($h\nu=hc/\lambda$). The predicted size and shape is confirmed by experimental
measurements: of the sub-picosecond time delay of the photo-electric effect, of
the attenuation of undiffracted transmission through slits narrower than the
soliton's diameter of $\lambda/\pi$, and by the threshold intensity required
for the onset of multiphoton absorption in focussed laser beams. Inside the
envelope the wave's amplitude increases linearly with the radial distance from
the axis of propagation, being zero on the axis. Outside the envelope the wave
is evanescent with an amplitude that decreases inversely with the radial
distance from the axis. The evanescent wave is responsible for the observed
double-slit interference phenomenon.

oscillators in an infinite linear harmonic chain. These operators are defined
as averages over local operators (individual oscillators) in the blocks. On the
one hand, this approach of &quot;physical blocks&quot; meets realistic experimental
conditions, where measurement apparatuses do not interact with single
oscillators but rather with a whole bunch of them, i.e., where in contrast to
usually studied &quot;mathematical blocks&quot; not every possible measurement is
allowed. On the other, this formalism naturally allows the generalization to
blocks which may consist of several non-contiguous regions. We quantify
entanglement between the collective operators by a measure based on the
Peres-Horodecki criterion and show how it can be extracted and transferred to
two qubits. Entanglement between two blocks is found even in the case where
none of the oscillators from one block is entangled with an oscillator from the
other, showing genuine bipartite entanglement between collective operators.
Allowing the blocks to consist of a periodic sequence of subblocks, we verify
that entanglement scales at most with the total boundary region. We also apply
the approach of collective operators to scalar quantum field theory.

magnetic molecular crystal (such as Mn${}_{12}$-Ac), when a time dependent
external magnetic field is applied parallel to the easy axis of the crystal. We
show that the back action of the cavity field on the sample significantly
increases the possibility of microwave emission. This radiation process can be
supperradiance or a maser-like effect, depending on the strength of the
dephasing. Our model provides further insight to the theoretical understanding
of the bursts of electromagnetic radiation observed in recent experiments
accompanying the resonant quantum tunneling of magnetization. The experimental

obtained for states which also minimize the uncertainty product. However, in
the uncertainty relation for angular momentum and angular position both sides
of the inequality are state dependent and therefore the intelligent states,
which satisfy the equality, do not necessarily give a minimum for the
uncertainty product. In this paper, we highlight the difference between
intelligent states and minimum uncertainty states by investigating a class of
intelligent states which obey the equality in the angular uncertainty relation
while having an arbitrarily large uncertainty product. To develop an

large-uncertainty intelligent states we compare exact solutions with analytical

Yang-Mills (YM) equations. In the present paper, we develop a new approach to
the calculation of the partition function $Z(t)$ beyond the Thomas-Fermi (TF)
approximation by adding a harmonic (Higgs) potential and taking the limit $v\to
0$, where $v$ is the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field. Using the
Wigner-Kirkwood method to calculate higher-order corrections in $\hbar$, we
show that the limit $v\to 0$ leads to power-like singularities of the type
$v^{-n}$, which reflect the possibility of escape of the particle along the
channels in the classical limit. We show how these singularities can be
eliminated by taking into account the quantum fluctuations dictated by the form
of the potential.

an odd number of qubits) achieves the smallest possible orbit dimension, equal

In this paper we show that any state with minimum orbit dimension must be of

quantum theory. We consider the domain of non-relativistic quantum theory,
relativistic quantum theory and quantum field theory, and in each domain we
consider the possibility of formulating a pilot-wave interpretation. For
non-relativistic quantum theory a pilot-wave interpretation in terms of
particle beables can readily be formulated. But this interpretation can in
general not straightforwardly be generalized to relativistic wave equations.
The problems which prevent us from devising a pilot-wave interpretation for
relativistic wave equations also plague the standard quantum mechanical
interpretation, where these problems led to the conception of quantum field
theory. Therefore most of our attention is focussed on the construction of a
pilot-wave interpretation for quantum field theory. We thereby favour the field
beable approach, developed amongst others by Bohm, Hiley, Holland, Kaloyerou
and Valentini. Although the field beable approach can be successfully applied
to bosonic quantum field theory, it seems not straightforward to do so for
fermionic quantum field theory.

interaction of low-energy string matter with space-time defects, such as
D-particles in the specific model of ``D-particle foam'', as well as dark

asymptotically large times, in which case such a damping is absent. Our

These analytical results -- which refine previous results on the divergence of

identically prepared chains, and which apply to single systems as encountered
in actual experimental situations -- are made quantitative for general
isotropic translationally invariant spin chains that can be mapped onto a

relaxation or decoherence. Often it is found that the equilibrium mixed state
of a spin system is not suitable as an initial state for computation and a
definite initial state is required to be prepared prior to the computation. As
these preferred initial states are non-equilibrium states, they are not
stationary and are destroyed with time as the spin system relaxes toward its
equilibrium, introducing error in computation. Since it is not possible to cut
off the relaxation processes completely, attempts are going on to develop
alternate strategies like Quantum Error Correction Codes or Noiseless
Subsystems. Here we study the relaxation behavior of various Pseudo Pure States
and analyze the role of Cross terms between different relaxation processes,
known as Cross-correlation. It is found that while cross-correlations
accelerate the relaxation of certain pseudo pure states, they retard that of
others.

superlattices as pure quantum states from a Fermi gas, we adiabatically
transform this state to an RVB state by change of the lattice parameters.
Results of exact time-dependent numerical studies for ladders systems are
presented, suggesting generation of RVB states on timescale smaller than
typical experimental decoherence times.

stabilization of mixed density operators to periodic orbits admits a natural
Lyapunov-based time-varying feedback design. A global description of the domain

  interactions can realize an autonomous quantum computer</title><description>  What is the simplest Hamiltonian which can implement quantum computation
without requiring any control operations during the computation process? In a
previous paper we have constructed a 10-local finite-range interaction among
qubits on a 2D lattice having this property. Here we show that
pair-interactions among qutrits on a 2D lattice are sufficient, too, and can
also implement an ergodic computer where the result can be read out from the
time average state after some post-selection with high success probability.
  Two of the 3 qutrit states are given by the two levels of a spin-1/2 particle
located at a specific lattice site, the third state is its absence. Usual
hopping terms together with an attractive force among adjacent particles induce
a coupled quantum walk where the particle spins are subjected to spatially
inhomogeneous interactions implementing holonomic quantum computing. The
holonomic method ensures that the implemented circuit does not depend on the
time needed for the walk.
  Even though the implementation of the required type of spin-spin interactions
is currently unclear, the model shows that quite simple Hamiltonians are
powerful enough to allow for universal quantum computing in a closed physical

the act of observation by assuming that the outcome correlates with the state
of the observed system and is codified as an actual property of the state of
the observer at the end of the measurement interaction. For an actual property,
the observed outcome has to affirm that property with certainty, hence in this
case the correlation needs to be perfect. A property is called classical if
either the property or its negation is actual. It is shown by a diagonal
argument that there exist classical properties of an observer that he cannot
observe perfectly. Because states are identified with the collection of
properties that are actual for that state, it follows that no observer can
perfectly observe his own state. Implications for the quantum measurement

techniques of imprinting closed vortex rings by means of coherently driving
internal atomic transitions with electromagnetic fields which exhibit singular
phase profiles. In particular, we show that a vortex ring can be prepared in a
controlled way by two focused co-propagating Gaussian laser beams. More complex
vortex systems may also be imprinted by directly superposing simpler field
configurations or by programming their phase profiles on optical holograms.
This provides the controlled method of studying vortex reconnections in atomic
superfluids. We analyze specific examples of two merging vortex rings in a
trapped two-component Rb-87 condensate. We calculate the radiated sound energy
in the vortex ring reconnection process and show that the vortex relaxation and
the re-distribution of sound energy can be controlled by the imprinting
process. The energy is first concentrated towards the trap center and later
emitted outwards as sound and transformed to surface excitations. As another
such technique, we study creating pairs of 2D point vortices in Bose-Einstein
condensates using a 'light roadblock' in ultra-slow light propagation. We show
how this can be used to study vortex collisions in compressible superfluids and
how these collisions result in energy dissipation via phonons and, sometimes,
annihilation of vortex pairs.

a sum of contributions associated with evanescent surface plasmon modes and
propagative cavity modes. In contrast to naive expectations, the plasmonic
modes contribution is essential at all distances in order to ensure the correct
result for the Casimir energy. One of the two plasmonic modes gives rise to a
repulsive contribution, balancing out the attractive contributions from
propagating cavity modes, while both contributions taken separately are much
larger than the actual value of the Casimir energy. This also suggests
possibilities to tailor the sign of the Casimir force via surface plasmons.

half-odd-integer $\ell$ and $m$ - presented in a previous paper] are shown to
have the same eigenfunction properties as the well-known Boson Spherical
Harmonics [$Y_\ell^{m}(\theta,\phi)$ for integer $\ell$ and $m$]. The Fermion
functions are shown to differ from the Boson functions in so far as the ladder
operators $M_+$ ($M_-$) that ascend (descend) the sequence of harmonics over
the values of $m$ for a given value of $\ell$, do not produce the expected
result {\em in just one case}: when the value of $m$ changes from $\pm{1/2}$ to
$\mp{1/2}$; i.e. when $m$ changes sign; in all other cases the ladder operators
produce the usually expected result including anihilation when a ladder
operator attempts to take $m$ outside the range: $-\ell\le m\le +\ell$.
  The unexpected result in the one case does not invalidate this scalar
coordinate representation of spin angular momentum, because the eigenfunction
property is essential for a valid quantum mechanical state, whereas ladder
operators relating states with different eigenvalues are not essential, and are
in fact known only for a few physical systems; that this coordinate
representation of spin angular momentum differs from the abstract theory of
angular momentum in this respect, is simply an interesting curiosity. This new
representation of spin angular momentum is expected to find application in the
theoretical description of physical systems and experiments in which the
spin-angular momentum (and associated magnetic moment) of a particle is
oriented in space, since the orientation is specifiable by the spherical polar
angles, $\theta$ and $\phi$.

$Y_\ell^{m}(\theta,\phi)$ for half-odd-integer values of $\ell$ and $m$, allows
for the introduction into quantum chemistry of explicit electron
spin-coordinates; i.e. spherical polar angles $\theta_s, \phi_s$, that specify
the orientation of the spin angular momentum vector in space. In this
coordinate representation the spin angular momentum operators, $S^2, S_z$, are
represented by the usual differential operators in spherical polar coordinates
(commonly used for $L^2, L_z$), and their electron-spin eigenfunctions are
$\sqrt{\sin\theta_s} \exp(\pm\phi_s/2)$. This eigenfunction representation has
the pedagogical advantage over the abstract spin eigenfunctions, $\alpha,
\beta,$ that ``integration over spin coordinates'' is a true integration (over
the angles $\theta_s, \phi_s$). In addition they facilitate construction of
many electron wavefunctions in which the electron spins are neither parallel
nor antiparallel, but inclined at an intermediate angle. In particular this may
have application to the description of EPR correlation experiments.

to include success probabilities $p&lt;1$ and prove bounds on the run time with
the same scaling as in the conditions for the $p\to 1$ limit. We supplement the
analytical results by numerical simulations of the global and local search.

a general constraint on the Lie algebra of the unitary group which defines this
subgroup, and hence guarantees parity invariance of the particle-bath
interaction. We show that generalizing the quantum lattice gas in this way
produces a model having both classical and quantum discrete random walks as
different limits. We present preliminary simulation results illustrating the
intermediate behavior in the presence of weak quantum noise.

the architecture of the quantum computer, the choice of algorithms (including
subroutines such as arithmetic), and the ``clock speed'' of the quantum
computer. The primary architectural features of interest are the ability to
execute multiple gates concurrently, the number of application-level qubits
available, and the interconnection network of qubits. We analyze Shor's
algorithm for factoring large numbers in this context. Our results show that,
if arbitrary interconnection of qubits is possible, a machine with an
application-level clock speed of as low as one-third of a (possibly encoded)
gate per second could factor a 576-bit number in under one month, potentially
outperforming a large network of classical computers. For nearest-neighbor-only
architectures, a clock speed of around twenty-seven gates per second is
required.

states shows that descriptions containing only statements about state vectors
and experiments outputs are the most suitable for Quantum Mechanics. In
particular, it is shown that statements about the undefined values of physical
quantities before measurement can be dropped without changing the predictions
of the theory. If we apply these ideas to EPR issues, we find that the concept
of non-locality with its 'instantaneous action at a distance' evaporates.
Finally, it is argued that usual treatments of philosophical realist positions
end up in the construction of theories whose major role is that of being
disproved by experiment. This confutation proves simply that the theories are
wrong; no conclusion about realism (or any other philosophical position) can be
drawn, since experiments deal always with theories and these are never logical

Mod. Optics 50, 913-933,
2003 and quant-ph/0403092] and Hayden and King [quant-ph/0409026], we study the
problem of the capacity of a quantum channel assisted by a &quot;friendly (channel)
environment&quot; that can locally measure and communicate classical messages to the
receiver.
  Previous work [quant-ph/0505038] has yielded a capacity formula for the
quantum capacity under this kind of help from the environment. Here we study
the problem of the environment-assisted classical capacity, which exhibits a
somewhat richer structure (at least, it seems to be the harder problem). There
are several, presumably inequivalent, models of the permitted local operations
and classical communications between receiver and environment: one-way,
arbitrary, separable and PPT POVMs. In all these models, the task of decoding a
message amounts to discriminating a set of possibly entangled states between
the two receivers, by a class of operations under some sort of locality
constraint.
  After introducing the operational capacities outlined above, we show that a
lower bound on the environment-assisted classical capacity is always half the
logarithm of the input space dimension. Then we develop a few techniques to
prove the existence of channels which meet this lower bound up to terms of much
smaller order, even when PPT decoding measurements are allowed (assuming a
certain superadditivity conjecture).

characteristics and the flux of photon pairs generated by spontaneous
parametric downconversion in quasi-phase matched bulk crystals for the use in
quantum communication sources. We show that, by careful design, one can attain
well defined modes close to the fundamental mode of optical fibers and obtain
high coupling efficiencies also for bulk crystals, these being more easily
aligned than crystal waveguides. We distinguish between singles coupling,
conditional coincidence, and pair coupling, and show how each of these
parameters can be maximized by varying the focusing of the pump mode and the
fiber-matched modes using standard optical elements. Specifically we analyze a
periodically poled KTP-crystal pumped by a 532 nm laser creating photon pairs
at 810 nm and 1550 nm. Numerical calculations lead to coupling efficiencies
above 94% at optimal focusing, which is found by the geometrical relation L/z_R
to be ~ 1 to 2 for the pump mode and ~ 2 to 3 for the fiber-modes, where L is
the crystal length and z_R is the Rayleigh-range of the mode-profile. These
results are independent on L. By showing that the single-mode bandwidth
decreases as 1/L, we can therefore design the source to produce and couple
narrow bandwidth photon pairs well into the fibers. Smaller bandwidth means
both less chromatic dispersion for long propagation distances in fibers, and
that telecom Bragg gratings can be utilized to compensate for broadened photon
packets--a vital problem for time-multiplexed qubits. Longer crystals also
yield an increase in fiber photon flux proportional to sqrt{L}, and so,
assuming correct focusing, we can only see advantages using long crystals.

  K.Svozil</title><description>  It is claimed in the above paper that, if time travel were possible, quantum
propagation would prevent classic time travel paradoxes by establishing
consistent loops; an example circuit is used to demonstrate such a loop. It is
argued here that established loops are not the framework in which the classic
paradoxes arise; rather they arise via the establishment of a concrete initial
history in which no disturbing time travel is allowed and then disturbing that
history via the launch of the time traveller. It is shown that, operated in
this two-pass fashion, if the first forward evolution of their circuit produces
a definite triggering of a backwards time travelling state, the re-evolution
thereby engendered may be organised so as to prohibit the triggering of this
state, thereby creating a classic time travel paradox.

inequality based on displaced on/off photodetection. Effects due to non-unit
quantum efficiency and nonzero dark counts are taken into account. Nonlocality
of both balanced and unbalanced superpositions of few photon-number states, as
well as that of multiphoton twin beams, is investigated. We find that
unbalanced superpositions show larger nonlocality than balanced one when noise
affects the photodetection process. De-Gaussification by means of

Bell parameter in the CHSH inequality is decreased, and is no longer given by
the Cirel'son bound.

by an atomic Sagnac interferometer, where for two ensembles propagating in
opposite directions in the interferometer this phase difference encodes the
angular velocity of the experimental setup. We discuss methods of squeezing
separately or jointly observables of the two atomic ensembles, and compare in
detail advantages and drawbacks of such schemes. In particular we show that the
method of joint squeezing may improve the variance by up to a factor of 2. We
take into account fluctuations of the number of atoms in both the preparation

of atoms in the two ensembles, as well as on the detection efficiency, which
have to be fulfilled in order to surpass the standard quantum limit. Under
realistic conditions, the performance of both schemes can be improved
significantly by reading out the phase difference via a quantum non-demolition

as the limit of S(N)/N at infinity, vanishes for all translation-invariant pure

such a state restricted to N consecutive spins, is sublinear. In this paper it
is proved that this conjecture cannot be sharpened, i.e., translation-invariant
states give rise to arbitrary fast sublinear entropy growth. The proof is
constructive, and is based on a class of states derived from quasifree states
on a CAR algebra. The question whether the entropy growth of pure quasifree
states can be arbitrary fast sublinear was first raised by Fannes et al. [J.

quant-ph/0003101 considered a more general setting, referred to as Private
quantum channels, in which instead of classical information, quantum states are
required to be transmitted and only one-way communication is allowed. They show
that in this case 2n bits of shared key is necessary and sufficient to transmit
an n-qubit state. We consider the most general setting in which we allow for
all possible combinations i.e. we let the input to be transmitted, the message
sent and the shared resources to be classical/quantum. We develop a general
framework by which we are able to show tight bounds on communication/shared
resources in all of these cases and this includes the results of Shannon and
Ambainis et al.
  As a consequence of our arguments we also show that in a one-way oblivious
Remote state preparation protocol for transferring an n-qubit pure state, the
entropy of the communication must be 2n and the entanglement measure of the
shared resource must be n. This generalizes on the result of Leung and Shor
which shows same bound on the length of communication in the special case when
the shared resource is maximally entangled e.g. EPR pairs and hence settles an

  transformations</title><description>  Simple examples of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with purely real spectra
defined in $L^2(R^+)$ having spectral singularities inside the continuous
spectrum are given. It is shown that such Hamiltonians may appear by shifting
the ndependent variable of a real potential into the complex plane. Also they
may be created as SUSY partners of Hermitian Hamiltonians. In the latter case
spectral singularities of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are ordinary points of
the continuous spectrum for its Hermitian SUSY partner. Conditions for
transformation functions are formulated when a complex potential with complex
eigenenergies and spectral singularities has a SUSY partner with a real
spectrum without spectral singularities. Finally we shortly discuss why
Hamiltonians with spectral singularities are `bad'.

entanglement properties exceptionally well suited for quantum computation. In
the present work, we experimentally demonstrate that correlations in a
four-qubit linear cluster state cannot be described by local realism. This
exploration is based on a recently derived Bell-type inequality [V. Scarani et
al., Phys. Rev A 71, 042325 (2005)] which is tailored, by using a combination
of three- and four-particle correlations, to be maximally violated by cluster
states but not violated at all by GHZ states. We observe a cluster state Bell
parameter of $2.59\pm 0.08$, which is more than 7 standard deviations larger
than the threshold of 2 imposed by local realism.

problem: the states are grouped in sets and we want to determine to which
particular set a given input state belongs.The simplest case, when the N given
states are divided into two subsets and the first set consists of one state
only while the second consists of all of the remaining states, is termed
quantum state filtering. We derived previously the optimal strategy for the

distinguishing |\psi_1 &gt; from the set {|\psi_2 &gt;, ..., |\psi_N &gt;} and the
corresponding optimal success and failure probabilities. In a previous paper

complete derivation of the probabilstic quantum algorithm that can optimally
distinguish between two classes of Boolean functions, that of the balanced

fails sometimes but when it does it lets us know that it did. Our approach can
be considered as a generalization of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm that was

causal} if the probability distribution for the fields in any region is
determined solely by physical data in the region's past, i.e. it is independent
of events at space-like separated points. General relativity is manifestly
locally causal, since the fields in a region are completely determined by
physical data in its past. It is natural to ask whether other possible theories
in which the fundamental description of space-time is classical and geometric
-- for instance, hypothetical theories which stochastically couple a classical
spacetime geometry to a quantum field theory of matter -- might also be locally
causal.
  A quantum theory of gravity, on the other hand, should allow the creation of
spacetimes which violate local causality at the macroscopic level. This paper
describes an experiment to test the local causality of spacetime, and hence to
test whether or not gravity behaves as quantum theories of gravity suggest, in
this respect. The experiment will either produce direct evidence that the
gravitational field is not locally causal, and thus weak confirmation of
quantum gravity, or else identify a definite limit to the domain of validity of
quantum theory.

entangled particles, even when isolated, are not allowed to possess definite
properties in their own right, as quantitatively expressed by violations of
Bell's inequalities [1]. Even as entanglement is now a key feature of quantum
information and communication technology [2,3], it remains the most puzzling
feature of quantum mechanics [4] and its conceptual foundation is still widely
debated. Here we demonstrate that physical systems providing dicotomic outcomes
are not able to guarantee both the rotation properties of physical quantities
and local realism. This result opens the way to a new formulation of quantum
mechanics based on only two elementary physical principles replacing the
abstract mathematical axiomes of the present theory. According to this
formulation, the coexistence of discrete outcomes with the classical continuous
transformation properties of physical quantities under coordinate
transformation inevitably implies quantum probabilities. These results, provide
a simple physical explanation to the most debated quantum features and put into
question the existence of physical quantities displaying continuous outcomes in
agreement with approaches that attempt to integrate quantum theory with general

  comparing local with global measurements</title><description>  Informationally complete measurements allow the estimation of expectation
values of any operator on a quantum system, by changing only the
data-processing of the measurement outcomes. In particular, an informationally
complete measurement can be used to perform quantum tomography, namely to
estimate the density matrix of the quantum state. The data-processing is
generally nonunique, and can be optimized according to a given criterion. In
this paper we provide the solution of the optimization problem which minimizes
the variance in the estimation. We then consider informationally complete
measurements performed over bipartite quantum systems focusing attention on
universally covariant measurements, and compare their statistical efficiency
when performed either locally or globally on the two systems. Among global
measurements we consider the special case of Bell measurements, which allow to
estimate the expectation of a restricted class of operators. We compare the
variance in the three cases: local, Bell, and unrestricted global--and derive
conditions for the operators to be estimated such that one type of measurement
is more efficient than the other. In particular, we find that for factorized
operators and Bell projectors the Bell measurement always performs better than
the unrestricted global measurement, which in turn outperforms the local one.
For estimation of the matrix elements of the density operator, the relative
performances depend on the basis on which the state is represented, and on the
matrix element being diagonal or off-diagonal, however, with the global
unrestricted measurement generally performing better than the local one.

of symmetric generalized measurements (POVMs) on a quantum computer. This
scheme is based on representation theory of groups and methods to decompose
matrices that intertwine two representations. We extend this scheme in such a
way that the measurement is minimally disturbing, i.e., it changes the state
vector \ket{\Psi} of the system to \sqrt{\Pi} \ket{\Psi} where \Pi is the
positive operator corresponding to the measured result.
  Using this method, we construct quantum circuits for measurements with
Heisenberg-Weyl symmetry. A continuous generalization leads to a scheme for
optimal simultaneous measurements of position and momentum of a Schr&quot;odinger
particle moving in one dimension such that the outcomes satisfy \Delta x \Delta
p \geq \hbar.
  The particle to be measured collides with two probe particles, one for the
position and the other for the momentum measurement. The position and momentum
resolution can be tuned by the entangled joint state of the probe particles
which is also generated by a collision with hard-core potential. The parameters
of the POVM can then be controlled by the initial widths of the wave functions
of the probe particles. We point out some formal similarities and differences
to simultaneous measurements of quadrature amplitudes in quantum optics.

(``states'') for such measurements is properly larger than the set of
quantum-mechanical mixed states for the Alice-Bob system. It is canonically
isomorphic to the set of positive (not necessarily completely positive) linear
maps Phi from the bounded linear operators on Alice's space to those on Bob's,
for which Tr Phi(I)=1. We review the fact that allowing classical communication
is equivalent to enforcing ``no-instantaneous-signalling'' (``no--influence'')
in the direction opposite the communication. We establish that in the subclass
of ``decomposable'' states, i.e. convex combinations of positive states with
&quot;PTP&quot; ones whose partial transpose is positive, the extremal states are just
the extremal positive and extremal PTP states. We show that two such states,
shared by the same pair of parties, cannot necessarily be combined as
independent states (their tensor product) if the full set of quantum operations
is allowed locally to each party. We use a framework of ``test spaces'' and
states on these, suited for exhibiting the analogies and deviations of
empirical probabilistic theories from classical probability theory. This leads
to a deeper understanding of analogies between quantum mechanics and Bayesian
probability theory. The existence of a ``most Bayesian'' quantum rule for
updating states after measurement, and its association with the situation when
information on one system is gained by measuring another, is a case of a
general proposition holding for test spaces combined subject to the

severely limits the secure key distribution distance in BB84 QKD systems with
Poissonian photon sources. In attempts to solve this problem,
entanglement-based QKD, single-photon based QKD, and entanglement
swapping-based QKD, have been studied in recent years. However, there are many
technological difficulties that must be overcome before these schemes can
become practical systems. Here we report a very simple QKD system, in which
secure keys were generated over &gt;100 km fibre for the first time. We used an
alternative protocol of differential phase shift keying (DPSK) but with a
Poissonian source. We analysed the security of the DPSK protocol and showed
that it is robust even against hybrid attacks including collective PNS attack
over consecutive pulses, intercept-and-resend (I-R) attack and beamsplitting
(BS) attack, because of the non-deterministic collapse of a wavefunction in a
quantum measurement. To implement this protocol, we developed a new detector

lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide followed by a Si avalanche photodiode (APD).
The use of the new detectors increased the sifted key generation rate up to &gt; 1
Mbit/s over 30 km fibre, which is two orders of magnitude larger than the

  Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  Niels Bohr introduced the concept of complementarity in order to give a
general account of quantum mechanics, however he stressed that the idea of
complementarity is related to the general difficulty in the formation of human
ideas, inherent in the distinction between subject and object. The
complementary descriptions approach is a framework for the interpretation of
quantum mechanics, more specifically, it focuses in the development of the idea
of complementarity and the concept of potentiality in the orthodox quantum
formulation. In PART I of this article, we analyze the ideas of Bohr and
present the principle of complementary description which takes into account
Einstein's ontological position. We argue, in PART II, that this development
allows a better understanding of some of the paradigmatic interpretational
problems in quantum mechanics, such as the measurement problem and the quantum
to classical limit. We conclude that one should further develop complementarity
in order to elaborate a consistent worldview.

  mechanics</title><description>  Quantum field theory is the traditional solution to the problems inherent in
melding quantum mechanics with special relativity. However, it has also long
been known that an alternative first-quantized formulation can be given for
relativistic quantum mechanics, based on the parametrized paths of particles in
spacetime. Because time is treated similarly to the three space coordinates,
rather than as an evolution parameter, such a spacetime approach has proved
particularly useful in the study of quantum gravity and cosmology. This paper
shows how a spacetime path formalism can be considered to arise naturally from
the fundamental principles of the Born probability rule, superposition, and
Poincar\'e invariance. The resulting formalism can be seen as a foundation for
a number of previous parametrized approaches in the literature, relating, in
particular, &quot;off-shell&quot; theories to traditional on-shell quantum field theory.
It reproduces the results of perturbative quantum field theory for free and
interacting particles, but provides intriguing possibilities for a natural
program for regularization and renormalization. Further, an important
consequence of the formalism is that a clear probabilistic interpretation can
be maintained throughout, with a natural reduction to non-relativistic quantum
mechanics.

of marked entries is not known. What is known is that the fraction of marked
entries is 1-X, where X is a random variable that is uniformly distributed in
the range (0,X_0) (X_0 is a small number). The problem is to try to select a
marked item from the database in a single query. If the algorithm selects a
marked item, it succeeds, else if it selects an unmarked item, it makes an
error. How low can we make the probability of error? The best possible
classical algorithm can lower the probability of error to O((X_0)^2). The best
known quantum algorithms for this problem could also only lower the probability
of error to O((X_0)^2). Using a recently invented quantum search technique,
this paper gives an algorithm that reduces the probability of error to
O((X_0)^3). The algorithm is asymptotically optimal.

  Fluctuations to Radiation Flux</title><description>  In this paper we analyze the interaction of a uniformly accelerated detector
with a quantum field in (3+1)D spacetime, aiming at the issue of how kinematics
can render vacuum fluctuations the appearance of thermal radiance in the
detector (Unruh effect) and how they engender flux of radiation for observers
afar. Two basic questions are addressed in this study: a) How are vacuum
fluctuations related to the emitted radiation? b) Is there emitted radiation
with energy flux in the Unruh effect? We adopt a method which places the
detector and the field on an equal footing and derive the two-point correlation
functions of the detector and of the field separately with full account of
their interplay. From the exact solutions, we are able to study the complete
process from the initial transient to the final steady state, keeping track of
all activities they engage in and the physical effects manifested. We derive a
quantum radiation formula for a Minkowski observer. We find that there does
exist a positive radiated power of quantum nature emitted by the detector, with
a hint of certain features of the Unruh effect. We further verify that the
total energy of the dressed detector and a part of the radiated energy from the
detector is conserved. However, this part of the radiation ceases in steady
state. So the hint of the Unruh effect in radiated power is actually not
directly from the energy flux that the detector experiences in Unruh effect.
Since all the relevant quantum and statistical information about the detector
(atom) and the field can be obtained from the results presented here, they are
expected to be useful, when appropriately generalized, for addressing issues of
quantum information processing in atomic and optical systems, such as quantum
decoherence, entanglement and teleportation.

qubit pair can be simulated with the help of shared randomness, supplemented
with additional resources, such as communication, post-selection or non-local
boxes. For instance, in the case of projective measurements, it is possible to
solve this problem with protocols using one bit of communication or making one
use of a non-local box. We show that this problem reduces to a distributed
sampling problem. We give a new method to obtain samples from a biased
distribution, starting with shared random variables following a uniform
distribution, and use it to build distributed sampling protocols. This approach
allows us to derive, in a simpler and unified way, many existing protocols for
projective measurements, and extend them to positive operator value

subtends a quantum concept of truth which originates quantum logic (QL) and is
radically different from the classical (Tarskian) concept of truth. We show in
this paper that QL can be interpreted as a pragmatic language of pragmatically
decidable assertive formulas, which formalize statements about physical systems
that are empirically justified or unjustified in the framework of QM. According
to this interpretation, QL formalizes properties of the metalinguistic concept
of empirical justification within QM rather than properties of a quantum
concept of truth. This conclusion agrees with a general integrationist
perspective, according to which nonstandard logics can be interpreted as
theories of metalinguistic concepts different from truth, avoiding competition
with classical notions and preserving the globality of logic. By the way, some
elucidations of the standard concept of quantum truth are also obtained.

is so-called asymptotic continuity. In this paper we provide general tools for
checking if a function possesses this property. First we prove equivalence of
asymptotic continuity with so-called it robustness under admixture. This allows
us to show that relative entropy distance from a convex set including maximally
mixed state is asymptotically continuous. Subsequently, we consider it arrowing
- a way of building a new function out of a given one. The procedure originates
from constructions of intrinsic information and entanglement of formation. We
show that arrowing preserves asymptotic continuity for a class of functions
(so-called subextensive ones). The result is illustrated by means of several
examples.

for decoherence in the generation of photon pairs from atomic ensembles, via
the protocol of Duan et. al for long distance quantum communication [Nature
(London) 414, 413 (2001)] and present the experimental techniques necessary to
properly control the process. We develop a theory to model in detail the
decoherence process in experiments with magneto-optical traps. The
inhomogeneous broadening of the ground state by the trap magnetic field is
identified as the principal mechanism for decoherence. In conjunction with our
theoretical analysis, we report a series of measurements to characterize and
control the coherence time in our experimental setup. We use copropagating
stimulated Raman spectroscopy to access directly the ground state energy
distribution of the ensemble. These spectroscopic measurements allow us to
switch off the trap magnetic field in a controlled way, optimizing the
repetition rate for single-photon measurements. With the magnetic field off, we
then measure nonclassical correlations for pairs of photons generated by the
ensemble as a function of the storage time of the single collective atomic
excitation. We report coherence times longer than 10 microseconds,
corresponding to an increase of two orders of magnitude compared to previous
results in cold ensembles. The coherence time is now two orders of magnitude
longer than the duration of the excitation pulses. The comparison between these
experimental results and the theory shows good agreement. Finally, we employ
our theory to devise ways to improve the experiment by optical pumping to
specific initial states.

pertaining to the physical behavior of a quantum computer to be framed, and in
principle, answered. We refer to the central organizing principle developed in
this paper, on which our theoretical structure is based, as the *Quantum
Computer Condition* (QCC), a rigorous mathematical statement that connects the
irreversible dynamics of the quantum computing machine, with the reversible
operations that comprise the quantum computation intended to be carried out by
the quantum computing machine. Armed with the QCC, we derive a powerful result
that we call the *Encoding No-Go Theorem*. This theorem gives a precise
mathematical statement of the conditions under which fault-tolerant quantum
computation becomes impossible in the presence of dissipation and/or
decoherence. In connection with this theorem, we explicitly calculate a
universal critical damping value for fault-tolerant quantum computation. In
addition we show that the recently-discovered approach to quantum error
correction known as &quot;operator quantum error-correction&quot; (OQEC) is a special
case of our more general formulation. Our approach furnishes what we will refer
to as &quot;operator quantum fault-tolerance&quot; (OQFT). In particular, we show how the
QCC allows one to derive error thresholds for fault tolerance in a completely
general context. We prove the existence of solutions to a class of
time-dependent generalizations of the Lindblad equation. Using the QCC, we also
show that the seemingly different circuit, graph- (including cluster-) state,

a single, universal paradigm for all physical quantum computation.

Lett. \textbf{89}, 187902 (2002)] freely in a noise channel. The vicious
eavesdropper, Eve, intercepts and measures the travel photon transmitted
between the sender and the receiver. Then she replaces the quantum signal with
a multi-photon signal in a same state, and measures the photons return with the
measuring basis with which Eve prepares the fake signal except for one photon.
This attack increase neither the quantum channel losses nor the error rate in
the sampling instances for eavesdropping check. It works for eavesdropping the
secret message transmitted with the ping-pong protocol. Finally, we propose a
way for improving the security of the ping-pong protocol.

variables for which the existing criteria for entanglement using the
inequalities involving the second order moments are insufficient. We derive new
inequalities involving higher order correlation, for testing entanglement in
non-Gaussian states. In this context we study an example of a non-Gaussian

  thermodynamics</title><description>  The issue of the Gibbs paradox is that when considering mixing of two gases
within classical thermodynamics, the entropy of mixing appears to be a
discontinuous function of the difference between the gases: it is finite for
whatever small difference, but vanishes for identical gases. The resolution
offered in the literature, with help of quantum mixing entropy, was later shown
to be unsatisfactory precisely where it sought to resolve the paradox.
Macroscopic thermodynamics, classical or quantum, is unsuitable for explaining
the paradox, since it does not deal explicitly with the difference between the
gases. The proper approach employs quantum thermodynamics, which deals with
finite quantum systems coupled to a large bath and a macroscopic work source.
Within quantum thermodynamics, entropy generally looses its dominant place and
the target of the paradox is naturally shifted to the decrease of the maximally
available work before and after mixing (mixing ergotropy). In contrast to
entropy this is an unambiguous quantity. For almost identical gases the mixing
ergotropy continuously goes to zero, thus resolving the paradox. In this
approach the concept of ``difference between the gases'' gets a clear
operational meaning related to the possibilities of controlling the involved
quantum states. Difficulties which prevent resolutions of the paradox in its
entropic formulation do not arise here. The mixing ergotropy has several
counter-intuitive features. It can increase when less precise operations are
allowed. In the quantum situation (in contrast to the classical one) the mixing
ergotropy can also increase when decreasing the degree of mixing between the
gases, or when decreasing their distinguishability. These points go against a
direct association of physical irreversibility with lack of information.

capacity of such information transfer is found exactly. It is shown that the
capacity is not enhanced by allowing the senders to perform joint operations.

paper by Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. It was argued that the theory of quantum
mechanics could not be called a complete theory of Nature, for every element of
reality is not represented in the formalism as such. The authors then put forth
a proposition: we must search for a theory where, upon knowing everything about
the system, including possible hidden variables, one could make precise
predictions concerning elements of reality. This project was ultimatly doomed
in 1964 with the work of Bell Bell, who showed that the most general local
hidden variable theory could not reproduce correlations that arise in quantum
mechanics. There exist mainly three forms of no-go theorems for local hidden
variable theories. Although almost every physicist knows the consequences of
these no-go theorems, not every physicist is aware of the distinctions between
the three or even their exact definitions. Thus we will discuss here the three
principal forms of no-go theorems for local hidden variable theories of Nature.
We will define Bell inequalities, Bell inequalities without inequalities and
pseudo-telepathy. A discussion of the similarities and differences will follow.

interferometric sensing by providing many orders of magnitude improvement in
interferometer sensitivity. The quantum-entangled particle interferometer
approach is very general and applies to many types of interferometers. In
particular, without nonlocal entanglement, a generic classical interferometer
has a statistical-sampling shot-noise limited sensitivity that scales like
$1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of particles passing through the
interferometer per unit time. However, if carefully prepared quantum
correlations are engineered between the particles, then the interferometer
sensitivity improves by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ to scale like 1/N, which is the
limit imposed by the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. For optical
interferometers operating at milliwatts of optical power, this quantum
sensitivity boost corresponds to an eight-order-of-magnitude improvement of
signal to noise. This effect can translate into a tremendous science pay-off
for space missions. For example, one application of this new effect is to fiber
optical gyroscopes for deep-space inertial guidance and tests of General
Relativity (Gravity Probe B). Another application is to ground and orbiting
optical interferometers for gravity wave detection, Laser Interferometer
Gravity Observatory (LIGO) and the European Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA), respectively. Other applications are to Satellite-to-Satellite laser
Interferometry (SSI) proposed for the next generation Gravity Recovery And

that the standard mapping of HCB systems onto spin-1/2 XY models fails in
application to computation of noise correlations. This is due to the
contribution of multiply occupied virtual states to noise correlations in
bosonic systems. Such states do not exist in spin models. We use these
correlations to explore quantum coherence of the ground states and re-address
the relationship between the peaks present in noise correlation and the Mott
phase. Our analysis points to distinctive new experimental signatures of the
Mott phase. The importance of these correlations is illustrated in an example
of a quasiperiodic potential that exhibits a localization transition. In this
case, in contrast to the momentum distribution, the noise correlations reveal
the presence of quasiperiodic order in the localized phase.

rather on local classical states and local quantum operations. In this way, we
are able to analyse distributed primitives such as superdense coding and
teleportation, obtaining interesting conclusions as to how the knowledge of
individual agents evolves. We show explicitly that the knowledge transfer in
teleportation is essentially classical, in that eventually, the receiving agent
knows that its state is equal to the initial state of the sender. The relevant
epistemic statements for teleportation deal with this correlation rather than
with the actual quantum state, which is unknown throughout the protocol.

  triple-well trap: Nonlinear eigenstates, Landau-Zener models and STIRAP</title><description>  We investigate the dynamics of a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) in a
triple-well trap in a three-level approximation. The inter-atomic interactions
are taken into account in a mean-field approximation (Gross-Pitaevskii
equation), leading to a nonlinear three-level model. New eigenstates emerge due
to the nonlinearity, depending on the system parameters. Adiabaticity breaks
down if such a nonlinear eigenstate disappears when the parameters are varied.
The dynamical implications of this loss of adiabaticity are analyzed for two
important special cases: A three level Landau-Zener model and the STIRAP
scheme. We discuss the emergence of looped levels for an equal-slope
Landau-Zener model. The Zener tunneling probability does not tend to zero in
the adiabatic limit and shows pronounced oscillations as a function of the
velocity of the parameter variation. Furthermore we generalize the STIRAP
scheme for adiabatic coherent population transfer between atomic states to the
nonlinear case. It is shown that STIRAP breaks down if the nonlinearity exceeds
the detuning.

attractive interactions on a M-site one-dimensional periodic -- necklace-like

promised by a recently proposed optical trapping scheme, as well as by the
control over the atomic interactions and tunneling amplitudes granted by
well-established optical techniques. We compare the properties of the quantum
model to a semiclassical picture based on a number-conserving su(M) coherent
state, which results into a set of modified discrete nonlinear Schroedinger
equations. We show that, owing to the presence of a correction factor ensuing
from number conservation, the ground-state solution to these equations provides
a remarkably satisfactory description of its quantum counterpart not only -- as
expected -- in the weak-interaction, superfluid regime, but even in the deeply
quantum regime of large interactions and possibly small populations. In
particular, we show that in this regime, the delocalized, Schroedinger-cat-like
quantum ground state can be seen as a coherent quantum superposition of the
localized, symmetry-breaking ground-state of the variational approach. We also
show that, depending on the hopping to interaction ratio, three regimes can be
recognized both in the semiclassical and quantum picture of the system.

equivalently, for an anisotropic Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain. This system is
frequently used to model quantum computers with perpetually coupled qubits. We
construct a bounded sequence of site energies that leads to strong
single-particle confinement of all states on individual sites. We show that
this sequence also leads to a confinement of all many-particle states in an

comparatively small. The results show viability of quantum computing with

states derived by linear optics from single photons. Although this no
nlinearity is nondeterministic, it is sufficient in principle to allow scalable
linear optics quantum computation (LOQC). The most obvious way to encode a
qubit optically is as a superposition of the vacuum and a single photon in one
mode -- so-called &quot;single-rail&quot; logic. Until now this approach was thought to
be prohibitively expensive (in resources) compared to &quot;dual-rail&quot; logic where a
qubit is stored by a photon across two modes. Here we attack this problem with
real-time feedback control, which can realize a quantum-limited phase
measurement on a single mode, as has been recently demonstrated experimentally.
We show that with this added measurement resource, the resource requirements
for single-rail LOQC are not substantially different from those of dual-rail
LOQC. In particular, with adaptive phase measurements an arbitrary qubit state
$\alpha \ket{0} + \beta\ket{1}$ can be prepared deterministically.

This transport is not ballistic in nature, but rather produced by quantum

elements of a quantum circuit, including measurements, in a form which makes no
reference to time (hence ``atemporal''). It can be used to relate quantum
dynamical properties to those of entangled states (map-state duality), and
suggests useful analogies, such as the inverse of an entangled ket. Diagrams
clarify the role of channel kets, transition operators, dynamical operators
(matrices), and Kraus rank for noisy quantum channels. Positive (semidefinite)
operators are represented by diagrams with a symmetry that aids in
understanding their connection with completely positive maps. The diagrams are
used to analyze standard teleportation and dense coding, and for a careful
study of unambiguous (conclusive) teleportation. A simple diagrammatic argument
shows that a Kraus rank of 3 is impossible for a one-qubit channel modeled
using a one-qubit environment in a mixed state.

  Fictionist</title><description>  A controversy that has arisen many times over in disparate contexts is
whether quantum coherences between eigenstates of certain quantities are fact
or fiction. We present a pedagogical introduction to the debate in the form of
a hypothetical dialogue between proponents from each of the two camps: a
factist and a fictionist. A resolution of the debate can be achieved, we argue,
by recognizing that quantum states do not only contain information about the
intrinsic properties of a system but about its extrinsic properties as well,
that is, about its relation to other systems external to it. Specifically, the
coherent quantum state of the factist is the appropriate description of the
relation of the system to one reference frame, while the incoherent quantum
state of the fictionist is the appropriate description of the relation of the
system to another, uncorrelated, reference frame. The two views, we conclude,
are alternative but equally valid paradigms of description.

decoherence induced by the quantum control itself. It is shown that, when the
controller is considered as a quantum system, it will entangle with its
controlled system and then cause quantum decoherence in the controlled system.
In competition with this induced decoherence, the controllability will be
limited by some uncertainty relation in a well-armed quantum control process.
In association with the phase uncertainty and the standard quantum limit, a
general model is studied to demonstrate the possibility of realizing a
decoherence-free quantum control with a finite energy within a finite time. It
is also shown that if the operations of quantum control are to be determined by
the initial state of the controller, then due to the decoherence which results
from the quantum control itself, there exists a low bound for quantum
controllability.

predicated on his Trennungsprinzip, a combination of separability and locality,
without which he believed objectification, and thereby &quot;physical thought&quot; and
&quot;physical laws&quot;, to be impossible. Bohr's philosophy (as elucidated by Hooker,
Scheibe, Folse, Howard, Held, and others), on the other hand, was grounded in a
seemingly different doctrine about the possibility of objective knowledge,
namely the necessity of classical concepts. In fact, it follows from Raggio's
Theorem in algebraic quantum theory that - within an appropriate class of
physical theories - suitable mathematical translations of the doctrines of Bohr
and Einstein are equivalent. Thus - upon our specific formalization - quantum
mechanics accommodates Einstein's Trennungsprinzip if and only if it is
interpreted a la Bohr through classical physics. Unfortunately, the
protagonists themselves failed to discuss their differences in this
constructive way, since their debate was dominated by Einstein's ingenious but
ultimately flawed attempts to establish the &quot;incompleteness&quot; of quantum
mechanics.
 This aspect of their debate may still be understood and appreciated, however,
as reflecting a much deeper and insurmountable disagreement between Bohr and
Einstein on the knowability of Nature. Using the theological controversy on the
knowability of God as a analogy, Einstein was a Spinozist, whereas Bohr could
be said to be on the side of Maimonides. Thus Einstein's off-the-cuff
characterization of Bohr as a 'Talmudic philosopher' was spot-on.

quantum computer can find a single marked object in a database of size N by
using only O(N^{1/2}) queries of the oracle that identifies the object. His
result was generalized to the case of finding one object in a subset of marked
elements. We consider the following computational problem: A subset of marked
elements is given whose number of elements is either M or K, M&lt;K, our task is
to determine which is the case. We show how to solve this problem with a high
probability of success using only iterations of Grover's basic step (and no
other algorithm). Let m be the required number of iterations; we prove that
under certain restrictions on the sizes of M and K the estimation m &lt;
(2N^{1/2})/(K^{1/2}-M^{1/2}) obtains. This bound sharpens previous results and
is known to be optimal up to a constant factor. Our method involves
simultaneous Diophantine approximations, so that Grover's algorithm is
conceptualized as an orbit of an ergodic automorphism of the torus. We comment
on situations where the algorithm may be slow, and note the similarity between
these cases and the problem of small divisors in classical mechanics.

quantum search algorithm mainly originates from the low efficiency to amplify
the amplitude of the marked state by the oracle unitary operation associated
with other known quantum operations. In order to bypass the square speedup
limitation of a standard quantum search algorithm it is necessary to develop
other type of quantum search algorithms. It is described in detail in the paper
for a quantum dynamical method to solve the quantum search problems in the
cyclic group state space. The binary dynamical representation for a quantum
state in the Hilbert space of the n-qubit quantum system is generalized to the
multi-base dynamical representation for a quantum state in the cyclic group
state space. Thus, any quantum state in the cyclic group state space may be
described completely in terms of a set of dynamical parameters that are closely
related to the symmetric property and structure of the cyclic group. The
quantum search problem therefore could be solved by determining the set of
dynamical parameters that describe completely the unknown marked state of the
search problem instead by directly measuring the marked state which is a
necessary step in the standard quantum search algorithm. An unstructured
quantum search problem in the Hilbert space is inevitably affected greatly by
the symmetric property and structure of a group. The main attempt of the paper
is to make use of the symmetric properties and structures of groups to help
solving the quantum search problems in the group state spaces. It is shown how
the quantum search process could be reduced from the cyclic group state space
to these cyclic group state subspaces with the help of the symmetric property
and structure of the cyclic group on a universal quantum computer.

developed for the calculations of bound states. The existing non-Hermitian
formalism breaks down when dealing with wavepackets(WP). An open question is
how time dependent expectation values can be calculated when the Hamiltonian is
NH ? Using the F-product formalism, which was recently proposed, [J. Phys.
Chem., 107, 7181 (2003)] we calculate the time dependent expectation values of
different observable quantities for a simple well known study test case model
Hamiltonian. We carry out a comparison between these results with those

fact that in the NH-QM, unlike standard QM, there is no need to split the
entire space into two regions; i.e., the interaction region and its

Typical realizations for such an environment are thermal baths for microwave

In a small sample of atoms, the emitted light can be switched from sub- to

super-bunched light over a wide range of bath parameters and thus fluorescence
light intensities. We also identify parameter ranges where the fields emitted

a silica microsphere. In spite of high temperature and $Q$-spoiling of
whispering gallery modes due to diffusion and refraction on the high index
semiconductor sample, room temperature lasing is obtained with less than 100
quantum dots. This result highlights the feasibility and interest of combining
self-assembled quantum dots and microspheres in view of cavity-quantum
electrodynamics experiments.

find that for either superconducting resonance the dynamics of the resonator is
given by a Fokker-Planck equation, i.e., the SSET behaves effectively as an
equilibrium heat bath, characterised by an effective temperature, which also
damps the resonator and renormalizes its frequency. Depending on the gate and

the SSET can also give rise to an instability in the mechanical resonator
marked by negative damping and temperature within the appropriate Fokker-Planck

the structure function of the corresponding SU(n) is known and is represented

Hawking's discovery that black holes evaporate thermally in contradiction to
the unitarity expected by quantum mechanics. Here we show that one of the
central presumptions of the debate is incorrect. Ensuring that information not
escape during the semi-classical evaporation process does not require that all
the information remain in the black hole until the final stages of evaporation.
Using recent results in quantum information theory, we find that the amount of
information that must remain in the black hole until the final stages of
evaporation can be very small, even though the amount already radiated away is
negligible. Quantum effects mean that information need not be additive: a small
number of quanta can lock a large amount of information, making it
inaccessible. When this small number of locking quanta are finally emitted, the
full information (and unitarity) is restored. Only if the number of initial
states is restricted will the locking mechanism leak out information early.

The potential is chosen to be zero except in a shell of thickness $\delta$,

  in two spatially separate cavities</title><description>  We consider the entanglement of orthogonal generalized Bernoulli states in
two separate single-mode high-$Q$ cavities. The expectation values and the
correlations of the electric field in the cavities are obtained. We then
define, in each cavity, a dichotomic operator expressible in terms of the field
states which can be, in principle, experimentally measured by a probe atom that
``reads'' the field. Using the quantum correlations of couples of these
operators, we construct a Bell's inequality which is shown to be violated for a
wide range of the degree of entanglement and which can be tested in a simple
way. Thus the cavity fields directly show quantum non-local properties. A
scheme is also sketched to generate entangled orthogonal generalized Bernoulli
states in the two separate cavities.

ground-state atom placed within an arbitrary arrangement of dispersing and
absorbing linear bodies can be expressed in terms of the polarizability of the
atom and the scattering Green tensor of the body-assisted electromagnetic
field. Based on a Born series of the Green tensor, a systematic expansion of
the Casimir-Polder potential in powers of the susceptibilities of the bodies is
presented. The Born expansion is used to show how and under which conditions
the Casimir-Polder force can be related to microscopic many-atom van der Waals
forces, for which general expressions are presented. As an application, the
Casimir-Polder potentials of an atom near a dielectric ring and an
inhomogeneous dielectric half space are studied and explicit expressions are
presented that are valid up to second order in the susceptibility.

164.19\pm 1.08 $ atomic units with a 0.66% uncertainty. Our experiment, which
is similar to an experiment done on sodium in 1995 by D. Pritchard and
co-workers, consists in applying an electric field on one of the two
interfering beams and measuring the resulting phase-shift. With respect to D.
Pritchard's experiment, we have made several improvements which are described
in detail in this paper: the capacitor design is such that the electric field
can be calculated analytically; the phase sensitivity of our interferometer is
substantially better, near 16 mrad/$\sqrt{Hz}$; finally our interferometer is
species selective it so that impurities present in our atomic beam (other
alkali atoms or lithium dimers) do not perturb our measurement. The extreme
sensitivity of atom interferometry is well illustrated by our experiment: our
measurement amounts to measuring a slight increase $\Delta v$ of the atom
velocity $v$ when it enters the electric field region and our present
sensitivity is sufficient to detect a variation $\Delta v/v \approx 6 \times
10^{-13}$.

in a unifying approach. Two of existing methods to define geometric phase, one
by Uhlmann's approach and the other by kinematic approach, which have been
considered to be distinct, are shown to be related in this framework. The
method is based upon purification of a density matrix by its uniform

from this decomposition. It is shown that the generalized parallel transport
condition can be satisfied when Uhlmann's condition holds. However, it does not

accepted as fundamental, general, and inescapable was subsequently seen to be
consequent, special, and dispensable. The idea was not truly a general feature
of the world, but only perceived to be general because of our special place in
the universe and the limited range of our experience. It was excess baggage
which had to be jettisoned to reach a more a more general perspective. This
article discusses excess baggage from the perspective of quantum cosmology
which aims at a theory of the universe's quantum initial state. We seek to
answer the question `Which features of our current theoretical framework are
fundamental and which reflect our special position in the universe or its
special initial condition?' Past instances of cosmological excess baggage are
reviewed such as the idea that the Earth was at the center of the universe or
that the second law of thermodynamics was fundamental. Examples of excess
baggage in our current understanding of quantum cosmology are the notion that
measurement is central to formulating quantum mechanics, a fundamental quantum
mechanical arrow of time, and the idea that a preferred time is needed to
formulate quantum theory. We speculate on candidates for future excess baggage.

the postulate of equal {\it a priori} probability in quantum statistical
mechanics. This modification, called the {\it quantum microcanonical postulate}
(QMP), asserts that for a system in microcanonical equilibrium all pure quantum
states having the same energy expectation value are realised with equal
probability. A simple model of a quantum system that obeys the QMP and that has
a nondegenerate spectrum with equally spaced energy eigenvalues is studied.
This model admits a closed-form expression for the density of states in terms
of the energy eigenvalues. It is shown that in the limit as the number of
energy levels approaches infinity, the expression for the density of states
converges to a $\delta$ function centred at the intermediate value $(E_{\rm
max}+E_{\rm min})/ 2$ of the energy. Determining this limit requires an
elaborate asymptotic study of an infinite sum whose terms alternate in sign.

parametrization to unitary matrices, which was essentially the canonical
coordinate of the second kind in the Lie group theory (math-ph/0505047).
  In this paper we apply the method to a quantum computation based on
multi-level system (qudit theory). Namely, by considering that the
parametrization gives a complete set of modules in qudit theory, we construct
the generalized Pauli matrices which play a central role in the theory and also
make a comment on the exchange gate of two-qudit systems.
  Moreover we give an explicit construction to the generalized Walsh-Hadamard
matrix in the case of n=3, 4 and 5. For the case of n=5 its calculation is
relatively complicated. In general, a calculation to construct it tends to
become more and more complicated as n becomes large.
  To perform a quantum computation the generalized Walsh-Hadamard matrix must
be constructed in a quick and clean manner. From our construction it may be
possible to say that a qudit theory with $n\geq 5$ is not realistic.

The condition is directly related to the PPT-criterion. We prove that the

agree that we are seeing a purely classical effect. The Bell test, though, is
not the only criterion by which the quantum-mechanical and local realist models

explored. The case of both space-space and momentum-momentum noncommuting is
considered. Spatial noncommutativity leads to the spectrum of the orbital
angular momentum of a Penning trap possessing fractional values, and in the
limits of vanishing kinetic energy and subsequent vanishing magnetic field,
this system has non-trivial dynamics. The dominant value of the lowest orbital
angular momentum is $\hbar/4$, which is a clear signal of spatial
noncommutativity. An experimental verification of this prediction by a
Stern-Gerlach-type experiment is suggested.

pairs in currently existing Josephson nanocircuits with capacitive couplings.
In these fixed coupling circuits, two-qubit logic gates could be easily
implemented while, strictly speaking, single-qubit gates cannot be easily
realized. For a known two-qubit state, conditional single-qubit operation could
still be designed to evolve only the selected qubit and keep the other qubit
unchanged; the rotation of the selected qubit depends on the state of the other
one. These conditional single-qubit operations allow to deterministically
generate the well-known Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs, represented by EPR-Bell
(or Bell) states. Quantum-state tomography is further proposed to
experimentally confirm the generation of these states. The decays of the
prepared EPR pairs are analyzed using numerical simulations. Possible
application of the generated EPR pairs to test Bell's Inequality is also
discussed.

There are two immediate consequences of this result. The first is that the

The second consequence is that continuous-time 1D quantum circuits with

times shorter than the time for a pi-pulse, the time optimal pi-pulse yields
the highest fidelity. For very long correlation times, fidelity loss is
approximately due to systematic error, which is efficiently tackled by
compensation for off-resonance with a pulse sequence (CORPSE). For intermediate

Numerical optimization of the pulse sequences using gradient ascent pulse

Specifically we consider a class algorithms which require only one bit to

  Photons and Electrons</title><description>  A classical circularly polarized electromagnetic wave carries angular
momentum, and represents the classical limit of a photon, which carries
quantized spin. It is shown that a very similar picture of a circularly
polarized coherent wave can account for both the spin of an electron and its
quantum wave function, in a Lorentz-invariant fashion. The photon-electron
interaction occurs through the usual electromagnetic potentials, modulating the
frequency and wavevector (energy and momentum) of this rotating spin field.
Other quantum particles can also be represented either as rotating spin fields,
or as composites of such fields. Taken together, this picture suggests an
alternative interpretation of quantum mechanics based solely on coherent wave
packets, with no point particles present.

investigated. Specifically, the entropy behavior in the low temperature limit,
which caused debates in the literature, is analyzed. It is stressed that the
behavior of the relaxation frequency in the $T\to0$ limit does not play a
physical role since the anomalous skin effect dominates in this range. In
contrast with the previous works, where the approximate Leontovich impedance
was used for analysis of nonlocal effects, we give description of the problem
in terms of exact nonlocal impedances. It is found that the Casimir entropy is
going to zero at $T\to0$ only in the case when $s$ polarization does not
contribute to the classical part of the Casimir force. However, the entropy
approaching zero from the negative side that, in our opinion, cannot be
considered as thermodynamically satisfactory. The resolution of the negative
entropy problem proposed in the literature is analyzed and it is shown that it
cannot be considered as complete. The crisis with the thermal Casimir effect is
stressed.

protect information-carrying quantum states against undesired interactions with
the environment. In past years, many good quantum error-correcting codes had
been derived as binary stabilizer codes. Fault-tolerant quantum computation
prompted the study of nonbinary quantum codes, but the theory of such codes is
not as advanced as that of binary quantum codes. This paper describes the basic
theory of stabilizer codes over finite fields. The relation between stabilizer
codes and general quantum codes is clarified by introducing a Galois theory for
these objects. A characterization of nonbinary stabilizer codes over GF(q) in
terms of classical codes over GF(q^2) is provided that generalizes the
well-known notion of additive codes over GF(4) of the binary case. This paper
derives lower and upper bounds on the minimum distance of stabilizer codes,
gives several code constructions, and derives numerous families of stabilizer
codes, including quantum Hamming codes, quadratic residue codes, quantum Melas
codes, quantum BCH codes, and quantum character codes. The puncturing theory by
Rains is generalized to additive codes that are not necessarily pure. Bounds on
the maximal length of maximum distance separable stabilizer codes are given. A
discussion of open problems concludes this paper.

observed experimentally [A. T. Black et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 203001

distribution the atoms evolve into one of two stable patterns that produce
superradiant scattering into the cavity. We derive analytic formulas for the
threshold and critical exponent of this phase transition from a mean-field
approach. Numerical simulations of the microscopic dynamics reveal that, on
laboratory timescale, a hysteresis masks the mean-field behaviour. Simple
physical arguments explain this phenomenon and provide analytical expressions
for the observable threshold. Above a certain density of the atoms a limited
number of ``defects'' appear in the organized phase, and influence the
statistical properties of the system. The scaling of the cavity cooling
mechanism and the phase space density with the atom number is also studied.

presence of a periodic process in some medium. Since, as first formulated by
Einstein's (1905) equation for the energy, all &quot;particles&quot; (neutrons,
electrons, photons, etc.) are each characterized by a specific &quot;frequency&quot;, the
inverse of this frequency is the smallest operational unit of time available in
principle. With a corresponding &quot;coarse graining&quot; of an otherwise practically
idealized, continuous time (i.e., with the latter then holding on time scales
much larger than the coarse grained one), one can show that the basic features
of quantum theory can be derived from a minimal set of assumptions. In
particular, it is shown here how the Schroedinger equation can be derived from
classical physics modified only by said assumption of a coarse grained time and
the presence of so-called &quot;zero-point fluctuations&quot;. The latter relate to the
dynamics of a &quot;fluid&quot; vacuum, which is today known to be a far cry from just
being &quot;empty space&quot;. Consequently, it is shown that time and matter, when
discussed from a physical point of view, must by necessity be considered in one
common framework.

calculate the time evolution of a qubit under arbitrary pulse sequences

two typical sequences: bb sequence consisting of only bit-flips, and bp
sequence consisting of both bit- and phase-flips. It is shown that the
effectiveness of the pulse sequences depends on a relative strength of the two
decoherence processes especially when a pulse interval is slightly shorter than
qubit-environment correlation times. In the short-interval limit, however, the
bp sequence is always more effective than, or at least as effective as, the bb

The latter of these two concepts is studied in particular form with a general
optical multiport device, consisting of an arbitrary array of beam-splitters
and phase-shifters. I show how such an apparatus generalizes the original
projection synthesis technique, introduced as an in principle technique to
measure the canonical phase distribution. Just as for the original projection
synthesis, it is found that such a generalised device can synthesize any
general projection onto a state in a finite dimensional Hilbert space. One of
the important findings of this thesis is that, unlike the original projection
synthesis technique, the general apparatus described here only requires a
classical, that is a coherent, reference field at the input of the device. Such
an apparatus lends itself much more readily to practical implementation and
would find applications in measurement and predictive state engineering.
  If we relax the above condition to allow for just a single non-classical
reference field, we show that the apparatus is capable of producing a
single-shot measure of canonical phase. That is, the apparatus can project onto
any one of an arbitrarily large subset of phase eigenstates, with a probability
proportional to the overlap of the phase state and the input field. Unlike the
original projection synthesis proposal, this proposal requires a binomial
reference state as opposed to a reciprocal binomial state. We find that such a
reference state can be obtained, to an excellent approximation, from a suitably
squeezed state.
  The analysis of these measurement apparatuses is performed in the less usual,
but completely rigorous, retrodictive formalism of quantum mechanics.

how to generate, the highly non-classical, entangled coherent states of the two
modes, both in the zero and large detuning cases. An advantage with the zero
detuning case is that the preparation is deterministic and no atomic
measurement is needed. For the large detuning situation a measurement is
required, leaving the field in either of two orthogonal entangled coherent
states.

linearly to density matrices, is proved very simply for a system that does not
interact with anything else. It is assumed that at each time the physical
quantities and states are described by the usual linear structures of quantum
mechanics. Beyond that, the proof assumes only that the dynamics does not
depend on anything outside the system but must allow the system to be described
as part of a larger system. The basic linearity is linked with previously
established results to complete a simple derivation of the linear Schrodinger
equation. For this it is assumed that density matrices are mapped one-to-one
onto density matrices. An alternative is to assume that pure states are mapped
one-to-one onto pure states and that entropy does not decrease.

view, limitations of error-correction and fault-tolerant quantum computation.
We consider stochastic models of quantum computation on $n$ qubits subject to
noise operators that are obtained as products of tiny noise operators acting on
a small number of qubits. We conjecture that for realistic random noise
operators of this kind there will be substantial dependencies between the noise
on individual qubits and, in addition, we propose that the dependence structure
of the noise acting on individual qubits will necessarily depend
(systematically) on the dependence structure of the qubits themselves. We point
out that the majority function can repair, in the classical case, some forms of
stochastic noise of this kind and conjecture that this healing power of
majority has no quantum analog. The main hypothesis of this paper is that these
properties of noise are sufficient to reduce quantum computation to
probabilistic classical computation. Some potentially relevant mathematical
issues and problems will be described. Our line of thought appears to be
related to that of physicists Alicki, Horodecki, Horodecki and Horodecki
[AHHH].

as such in the very discovery or creation of both of these physical theories.
And this a priori role is far more important than all the possible a posteriori
interplays between consciousness and the mentioned two theories of physics,
interplays which may happen during one or another specific experiment,

the games are played using quantum mechanical toolbox (entanglement, unitary
operators, measurement). Researchers have concentrated in two-player-two
strategy, 2x2, dilemma containing classical games, and transferred them into
quantum realm showing that in quantum pure strategies dilemmas in such games
can be resolved if entanglement is distributed between the players armed with
quantum operations. Moreover, it became clear that the players receive the
highest sum of payoffs available in the game, which are otherwise impossible in
classical pure strategies. Encouraged by the observation of rich dynamics of
physical systems with many interacting parties and the power of entanglement in
quantum versions of 2x2 games, it became generally accepted that quantum
versions can be easily extended to N-player situations by simply allowing
N-partite entangled states. In this article, however, we show that this is not
generally true because the reproducibility of classical tasks in quantum domain
imposes limitations on the type of entanglement and quantum operators. We
propose a benchmark for the evaluation of quantum and classical versions of
games, and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a physical
realization. We give examples of entangled states that can and cannot be used,
and the characteristics of quantum operators used as strategies.

given fixed entangled state of many qubits and perform computation by applying
a sequence of measurements to designated qubits in designated bases. The choice
of basis for later measurements may depend on earlier measurement outcomes and
the final result of the computation is determined from the classical data of
all the measurement outcomes. This is in contrast to the more familiar gate
array model in which computational steps are unitary operations, developing a
large entangled state prior to some final measurements for the output. Two
principal schemes of measurement based computation are teleportation quantum
computation (TQC) and the so-called cluster model or one-way quantum computer
(1WQC). We will describe these schemes and show how they are able to perform
universal quantum computation. We will outline various possible relationships
between the models which serve to clarify their workings. We will also discuss
possible novel computational benefits of the measurement based models compared

adding a &quot;gauge&quot; group to the standard stabilizer definition of a code that
defines an equivalence class between encoded states. Gauge transformations
leave the encoded information unchanged; their effect is absorbed by virtual

construction by identifying a gauge symmetry in Shor's 9-qubit code that allows
us to remove 4 of its 8 stabilizer generators, leading to a simpler decoding

contradictory and confusing definitions. By explicitly recognising a role for
the observer of a system, an observer that attaches meaning to data about the
system, these contradictions can be resolved, and the numerous complexity
measures that have been proposed can be seen as cases where different observers
are relevant, and/or being proxy measures that loosely scale with complexity,
but are easy to compute from the available data. Much of the epistemic
confusion in the subject can be squarely placed at science's tradition of
removing the observer from the description in order to guarantee {\em
objectivity}. Explicitly acknowledging the role of the observer helps untangle
other confused subject areas. {\em Emergence} is a topic about which much ink
has been spilt, but it can be understand easily as an irreducibility between
description space and meaning space. Quantum Mechanics can also be understood
as a theory of observation. The success in explaining quantum mechanics, leads
one to conjecture that all of physics may be reducible to properties of the
observer. And indeed, what are the necessary (as opposed to contingent)
properties of an observer? This requires a full theory of consciousness, from
which we are a long way from obtaining. However where progress does appear to
have been made, e.g. Daniel Dennett's {\em Consciousness Explained}, a
recurring theme of self-observation is a crucial ingredient.

information channel. The communicator devices do dissipate energy; however,
they do not emit net energy into the channel, instead of that, they modulate
the parameters of inherent spontaneous fluctuations in the channel. The method
can use two different mechanisms, thermal noise (Johnson-Nyquist noise) for
classical communication, and vacuum fluctuations/zero point energy (quantum
uncertainty noise) for quantum communication. The strongest advantage of the
method that this is apparently the most hidden (stealth) way of communication,
because it is using the inherent background noise for communication, therefore
it is extremely difficult or impossible to discover its presence. With proper
wave-based arrangements and specific conditions, the sender and the receiver
can easily detect eavesdropper activities, so that the eavesdropper is detected
as soon as she extracts a single bit of information, thus the security of the
method is comparable to the security of quantum communication/quantum key
distribution schemes. Finally, concerning practical applications, environmental
noise, out of the fundamental/inherent fluctuations, can also be used for this
kind of communication provided that is sufficiently stationary.

be corrected using control codes. In classical test and verification one
develops a test set separating a correct circuit from a circuit containing any
considered fault. Classical faults are modelled at the logical level by fault
models that act on classical states. The stuck fault model, thought of as a
lead connected to a power rail or to a ground, is most typically considered. A
classical test set complete for the stuck fault model propagates both binary
basis states, 0 and 1, through all nodes in a network and is known to detect
many physical faults. A classical test set complete for the stuck fault model
allows all circuit nodes to be completely tested and verifies the function of
many gates. It is natural to ask if one may adapt any of the known classical
methods to test quantum circuits. Of course, classical fault models do not
capture all the logical failures found in quantum circuits. The first obstacle
faced when using methods from classical test is developing a set of realistic
quantum-logical fault models. Developing fault models to abstract the test
problem away from the device level motivated our study. Several results are
established. First, we describe typical modes of failure present in the
physical design of quantum circuits. From this we develop fault models for
quantum binary circuits that enable testing at the logical level. The
application of these fault models is shown by adapting the classical test set
generation technique known as constructing a fault table to generate quantum
test sets. A test set developed using this method is shown to detect each of
the considered faults.

We study the
simple model of static black holes: the horizon is made of a given number of
identical elementary surfaces and these small surfaces all behaves as a spin-s
system accordingly to LQG. The chosen spin-s defines the area unit or area
resolution, which the observer uses to probe the space(time) geometry. For
s=1/2, we are actually dealing with the qubit model, where the horizon is made
of a certain number of qubits. In this context, we compute the black hole
entropy and show that the factor in front of the logarithmic correction to the
entropy formula is independent of the unit s. We also compute the entanglement
between parts of the horizon. We show that these correlations between parts of
the horizon are directly responsible for the asymptotic logarithmic
corrections. This leads us to speculate on a relation between the evaporation
process and the entanglement between a pair of qubits and the rest of the
horizon. Finally, we introduce a concept of renormalisation of areas in LQG.

apparatus A triggers the establishment of correlations, which provide
statistical information about S. Robust registration requires A to be
macroscopic, and a dynamical symmetry breaking of A governed by S allows the
absence of any bias. Phase transitions are thus a paradigm for quantum
measurement apparatuses, with the order parameter as pointer variable. The
coupling $g$ behaves as the source of symmetry breaking. The exact solution of
a model where S is a single spin and A a magnetic dot (consisting of $N$
interacting spins and a phonon thermal bath) exhibits the reduction of the
state as a relaxation process of the off-diagonal elements of S+A, rapid due to
the large size of $N$. The registration of the diagonal elements involves a
slower relaxation from the initial paramagnetic state of A to either one of its
ferromagnetic states. If $g$ is too weak, the measurement fails due to a
``Buridan's ass'' effect. The probability distribution for the magnetization
then develops not one but two narrow peaks at the ferromagnetic values. During
its evolution it goes through wide shapes extending between these values.

completely determined by specifying correlations between measurements performed
on subsystems only. Despite the fact that the quantum correlations thus suffice
to reconstruct the quantum state, we show, using a Bell inequality argument,
that they cannot be regarded as objective local properties of the composite
system in question. It is well known since the work of J.S. Bell, that one
cannot have locally preexistent values for all physical quantities, whether
they are deterministic or stochastic. The Bell inequality argument we present
here shows this is also impossible for correlations among subsystems of an
individual isolated composite system. Neither of them can be used to build up a
world consisting of some local realistic structure. As a corrolary to the
result we argue that entanglement cannot be considered ontologically robust.
The argument has an important advantage over others because it does not need
perfect correlations but only statistical correlations. It can therefore easily
be tested in currently feasible experiments using four particle entanglement.

Recent estimates of the threshold are near some experimentally achieved gate
fidelities. However, the landscape of threshold estimates includes
pseudothresholds, threshold estimates based on a subset of components and a low
level of recursion. In this paper, we observe that pseudothresholds are a
generic phenomenon in fault-tolerant computation. We define pseudothresholds

pseudothresholds that differ by a factor of 4 from fault-tolerance thresholds
for typical relationships between component failure rates. We develop tools for

Unlike to the purely AdS bulk, the part induced by a single brane, in addition
to the distance from the brane, depends also on the position of the brane in
the bulk. The asymptotic behavior of this part is investigated for the points
near the brane and for the position of the brane close to the AdS horizon and
AdS boundary. The vacuum forces acting on the branes are presented as a sum of

Schemes so far demonstrated in the solid state imply an energy relaxation which

photon indistinguishability. We focus our theoretical investigation on
semiconductor quantum dots embedded in microcavities. Simple and general

for certain Hamiltonians heat capacity would not tend asymptotically to zero as
the temperature approaches absolute zero. Since this would contradict the third

that v(x) is purely imaginary, the latter have the form of a nonhomogeneous

v(x)=i \epsilon x^3. This reveals an infinite class of previously unknown CPT-

for the sake of comparison with the classical and quantum cases. One of these
includes states that can give rise to arbitrary non-signalling correlations,
including the super-quantum correlations that have become known in the

these correlations in the context of a theory with well-defined dynamics, I
hope to make further progress with a question raised by Popescu and Rohrlich,
which is, why does quantum theory not allow these strongly nonlocal

In this article, two such models are investigated: one that achieves state
reduction in infinite time, and the other in finite time. The properties of the
associated energy expectation process and the energy variance process are
worked out in detail. By use of a novel application of a nonlinear filtering
method, closed-form solutions--algebraic in character and involving no
integration--are obtained for both these models. In each case, the solution is
expressed in terms of a random variable representing the terminal energy of the
system, and an independent noise process. With these solutions at hand it is
possible to simulate explicitly the dynamics of the quantum states of
complicated physical systems.

  qubits</title><description>  We introduce an architecture for robust and scalable quantum computation
using both stationary qubits (e.g. single photon sources made out of trapped
atoms, molecules, ions, quantum dots, or defect centers in solids) and flying
qubits (e.g. photons). Our scheme solves some of the most pressing problems in
existing non-hybrid proposals, which include the difficulty of scaling
conventional stationary qubit approaches, and the lack of practical means for
storing single photons in linear optics setups. We combine elements of two
previous proposals for distributed quantum computing, namely the efficient
photon-loss tolerant build up of cluster states by Barrett and Kok [Phys. Rev.
A 71, 060310(R) (2005)] with the idea of Repeat-Until-Success (RUS) quantum
computing by Lim et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 030505 (2005)]. This idea can be
used to perform eventually deterministic two-qubit logic gates on spatially
separated stationary qubits via photon pair measurements. Under non-ideal
conditions, where photon loss is a possibility, the resulting gates can still
be used to build graph states for one-way quantum computing. In this paper, we
describe the RUS method, present possible experimental realizations, and
analyse the generation of graph states.

here as equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of quantum states of finite
strings of qubits. There are 4 types of qubits each with associated single
qubit annihilation creation (a-c) operators that give the state and location of
each qubit type on a 2 dimensional integer lattice. The string states, defined
as finite products of creation operators acting on the qubit vacuum state
correspond to complex rational numbers with real and imaginary components.
These states span a Fock space. Arithmetic relations and operations are defined
for the string states. Cauchy sequences of these states are defined, and the
arithmetic relations and operations lifted to apply to these sequences. Based
on these, equivalence classes of these sequences are seen to have the requisite
properties of real and complex numbers. The representations have some
interesting aspects. Quantum equivalence classes are larger than their
corresponding classical classes, but no new classes are created. There exist
Cauchy sequences such that each state in the sequence is an entangled
superposition of the real and imaginary components, yet the sequence is a real
number. Also, except for coefficients of superposition states, the construction
is done with no reference to the real and complex number base, R and C, of the
Fock space.

loop in the described way, and ask about the configuration which
\emph{maximizes} the ground state energy. We reduce both of them to geometric
inequalities which involve chords of $\Gamma$; it will be shown that a sharp

an additional modulation angle -- dependent on both the Rashba and Dresselhaus
interaction strengths -- which allows for further independent coherent control
of the electrons traversing the incoming leads. We derive explicit shot noise
formulas for a variety of correlated pairs (e.g., Bell states) and lead spin

defined along the quantization axis perpendicular to lead 1 (with the local
\textit{s-o} interaction) and in the plane of the beam splitter display
distinctive shot noise for injection energies near the channel anticrossings;
hence, one can tell apart all the triplets, in addition to the singlet, through
noise measurements. We also find that spin-orbit induced backscattering within
lead 1 reduces the visibility of the noise oscillations, due to the additional
partition noise in this lead. Finally, we consider injection of two-particle
wavepackets into leads with multiple discrete states and find that two-particle
entanglement can still be observed via noise bunching and antibunching.

bits of information (qubits), from one place to another. On the fundamental
side, this allows one to distribute entanglement and demonstrate quantum
nonlocality over significant distances. On the more applied side, quantum
cryptography offers, for the first time in human history, a provably secure way
to establish a confidential key between distant partners. Photons represent the
natural flying qubit carriers for quantum communication, and the presence of
telecom optical fibres makes the wavelengths of 1310 and 1550 nm particulary
suitable for distribution over long distances. However, to store and process
quantum information, qubits could be encoded into alkaline atoms that absorb
and emit at around 800 nm wavelength. Hence, future quantum information
networks made of telecom channels and alkaline memories will demand interfaces
able to achieve qubit transfers between these useful wavelengths while
preserving quantum coherence and entanglement. Here we report on a qubit
transfer between photons at 1310 and 710 nm via a nonlinear up-conversion
process with a success probability greater than 5%. In the event of a
successful qubit transfer, we observe strong two-photon interference between
the 710 nm photon and a third photon at 1550 nm, initially entangled with the
1310 nm photon, although they never directly interacted. The corresponding
fidelity is higher than 98%.

scattering systems, in particular two spin systems that interact via
rotationally-invariant scattering. The spin degrees of freedom of the in-states

entanglement. Because of the restriction of rotationally-symmetric
interactions, perfectly-entangling S-matrices, i.e. those that lead to a

measurements have features very different from those of single-time
measurements. First, they cannot be modelled by a classical stochastic process.
Second, they are contextual, namely they depend strongly on the specific
measurement scheme through which they are determined. We construct
Positive-Operator-Valued measures (POVM) that provide such probabilities. For
observables with continuous spectrum, the constructed POVMs depend strongly on
the resolution of the measurement device, a conclusion that persists even if we
consider a quantum mechanical measurement device or the presence of an
environment. We then examine the same issues in alternative interpretations of
quantum theory. We first show that multi-time probabilities cannot be naturally
defined in terms of a frequency operator. We next prove that local hidden
variable theories cannot reproduce the predictions of quantum theory for
sequential measurements, even when the degrees of freedom of the measuring
apparatus are taken into account. Bohmian mechanics, however, does not fall in
this category. We finally examine an alternative proposal that sequential
measurements can be modelled by a process that does not satisfy the Kolmogorov
axioms of probability. This removes contextuality without introducing
non-locality, but implies that the empirical probabilities cannot be always
defined (the event frequencies do not converge). We argue that the predictions
of this hypothesis are not ruled out by existing experimental results
(examining in particular the &quot;which way&quot; experiments); they are, however,
distinguishable in principle.

  specimen</title><description>  We establish that the leading critical scaling of the single-copy
entanglement is exactly one half of the entropy of entanglement of a block in
critical infinite spin chains in a general setting, using methods of conformal
field theory. Conformal symmetry imposes that the single-copy entanglement for
critical many-body systems scales as E_1(\rho_L)=(c/6) \log L- (c/6)
(\pi^2/\log L) + O(1/L), where L is the number of constituents in a block of an
infinite chain and c corresponds to the central charge. This proves that from a
single specimen of a critical chain, already half the entanglement can be
distilled compared to the rate that is asymptotically available. The result is
substantiated by a quantitative analysis for all translationally invariant
quantum spin chains corresponding to general isotropic quasi-free fermionic
models. An analytic example of the XY model shows that away from criticality
the above simple relation is only maintained near the quantum phase transition
point.

quantum mechanics. Our treatment is based upon the facts that (i) time appears
in quantum theory as an external parameter to the system, and (ii) propositions
about the time-of-arrival appear naturally when one considers histories. The
definition of time-of-arrival probabilities is straightforward in stochastic
processes. The difficulties that arise in quantum theory are due to the fact
that the time parameter of Schr\&quot;odinger's equation does not naturally define a
probability density at the continuum limit, but also because the procedure one
follows is sensitive on the interpretation of the reduction procedure. We
consider the issue in Copenhagen quantum mechanics and in history-based schemes
like consistent histories. The benefit of the latter is that it allows a proper
passage to the continuous limit--there are however problems related to the
quantum Zeno effect and decoherence. We finally employ the histories-based
description to construct Positive-Operator-Valued-Measures (POVMs) for the
time-of-arrival, which are valid for a general Hamiltonian. These POVMs
typically depend on the resolution of the measurement device; for a free
particle, however, this dependence cancels in the physically relevant regime
and the POVM coincides with that of Kijowski.

  lattices: from superfluidity to density waves</title><description>  For systems of interacting, ultracold spin-zero neutral bosonic atoms,
harmonically trapped and subject to an optical lattice potential, we derive an
Extended Bose Hubbard (EBH) model by developing a systematic expansion for the
Hamiltonian of the system in powers of the lattice parameters and of a scale
parameter, the {\it lattice attenuation factor}. We identify the dominant terms
that need to be retained in realistic experimental conditions, up to
nearest-neighbor interactions and nearest-neighbor hoppings conditioned by the
on site occupation numbers. In mean field approximation, we determine the free
energy of the system and study the phase diagram both at zero and at finite
temperature. At variance with the standard on site Bose Hubbard model, the zero
temperature phase diagram of the EBH model possesses a dual structure in the
Mott insulating regime. Namely, for specific ranges of the lattice parameters,
a density wave phase characterizes the system at integer fillings, with domains
of alternating mean occupation numbers that are the atomic counterparts of the
domains of staggered magnetizations in an antiferromagnetic phase. We show as
well that in the EBH model, a zero-temperature quantum phase transition to pair
superfluidity is in principle possible, but completely suppressed at lowest
order in the lattice attenuation factor. Finally, we determine the possible
occurrence of the different phases as a function of the experimentally
controllable lattice parameters.

dynamics under perturbations of the Hamiltonian. Our approach relies on
semiclassical approximations, but is non-perturbative. Two separate
contributions to the quantum fidelity are identified: one factor derives from
the dispersion of the wave packets, whereas the other factor is determined by
the separation of a trajectory of the perturbed classical system away from a
corresponding unperturbed trajectory. We furthermore estimate both
contributions in terms of classical Lyapunov exponents and find a decay of
fidelity that is, generically, at least exponential, but may also be doubly
exponential. The latter case is shown to be realised for inverted harmonic
oscillators.

weak and has a short memory time, two approximate treatments of correlation in
fermionic systems by means of Markovian quantum jump are presented. A
simplified scenario for the introduction of fluctuations beyond mean-field is
first presented. In this theory, part of the quantum correlations between the
residual interaction and the one-body density matrix are neglected and jumps
occur between many-body densities formed of pairs of states $D=| \Phi_a &gt; &lt;
\Phi_b |/&lt; \Phi_b . |\Phi_a &gt;$ where $| \Phi_a &gt;$ and $| \Phi_b &gt;$ are
antisymmetrized products of single-particle states. The underlying Stochastic
Mean-Field (SMF) theory is discussed and applied to the monopole vibration of a
spherical $^{40}$Ca nucleus under the influence of a statistical ensemble of
two-body contact interaction. This framework is however too simplistic to
account for both fluctuation and dissipation. In the second part of this work,
an alternative quantum jump method is obtained without making the approximation
on quantum correlations. Restricting to two particles-two holes residual
interaction, the evolution of the one-body density matrix of a correlated
system is transformed into a Lindblad equation. The associated dissipative
dynamics can be simulated by quantum jumps between densities written as $D = |
\Phi &gt;&lt; \Phi |$ where $| \Phi &gt;$ is a normalized Slater determinant. The
associated stochastic Schroedinger equation for single-particle wave-functions
is given.

  objective biophysical resolution of the measurement problem</title><description>  An analysis has been performed of the theories and postulates advanced by von
Neumann, London and Bauer, and Wigner, concerning the role that consciousness
might play in the collapse of the wave function, which has become known as the
measurement problem. This reveals that an error may have been made by them in
the area of biology and its interface with quantum mechanics, when they called
for the reduction of any superposition states in the brain through the mind or
consciousness. Many years later Wigner changed his mind to reflect a simpler
and more realistic objective position, expanded upon by Shimony, which appears
to offer a way to resolve this issue. The argument is therefore made that the
wave function of any superposed photon state or states is always objectively
changed within the complex architecture of the eye in a continuous linear
process initially for most of the superposed photons, followed by a
discontinuous nonlinear collapse process later for any remaining superposed
photons, thereby guaranteeing that only final, measured information is
presented to the brain, mind or consciousness. An experiment to be conducted in
the near future may enable us to simultaneously resolve the measurement problem
and also determine if the linear nature of quantum mechanics is violated by the
perceptual process.

that a state is entangled if at least one among the values assumed by the
corresponding discrete WF is smaller than a certain critical (negative) value.
Then, based on the Partial Transposition criterion, we establish the relation
between the separability of a density matrix and the non-negativity of the WF's

  Finally, we derive a simple inequality --involving the covariance-matrix

$G_N$ with $N=c=16$. Their protocol applies only to Hadamard graphs where $N$

Bohr had no defence against Einstein's 1935 attack (the EPR paper) on the
claimed completeness of orthodox quantum mechanics. I suggest that Einstein's
argument, as stated most clearly in 1946, could justly be called Einstein's
reality-locality-completeness theorem, since it proves that one of these three
must be false. Einstein's instinct was that completeness of orthodox quantum
mechanics was the falsehood, but he failed in his quest to find a more complete
theory that respected reality and locality. Einstein's theorem, and possibly
Einstein's failure, inspired John Bell in 1964 to prove his reality-locality
theorem. This strengthened Einstein's theorem (but showed the futility of his
quest) by demonstrating that either reality or locality is a falsehood. This
revealed the full nonlocality of the quantum world for the first time.

bit. We use this generalization to exactly capture the adversary bound of a
composite function in terms of the adversary bounds of its component functions.
Our results generalize and unify previously known composition properties of
adversary methods, and yield as a simple corollary the Omega(sqrt{n}) bound of
Barnum and Saks on the quantum query complexity of read-once functions.

  absorption spectrum-II</title><description>  Interaction of the internal states of an atom with spatially dependent
standing-wave cavity field can impart position information of the atom passing
through it leading to subwavelength atom localization. We recently demonstrated
a new regime of atom localization [Sahrai {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 72},
013820 (2005)], namely sub-half-wavelength localization through phase control
of electromagnetically induced transparency. This regime corresponds to extreme
localization of atoms within a chosen half-wavelength region of the
standing-wave cavity field. Here we present further investigation of the
simplified model considered earlier and show interesting features of the
proposal. We show how the model can be used to simulate variety of energy level
schemes. Furthermore, the dressed-state analysis is employed to explain the
emergence and suppression of the localization peaks, and the peak positions and
widths. The range of parameters for obtaining clean sub-half-wavelength
localization is identified.

single photon sources, linear optical elements and photon-number resolving
detectors. These gates are heralded but operate with probabilities much less
than one. There is currently a large gap between the performance of the known
circuits and the established upper bounds on their success probabilities. One
possibility for increasing the probability of success of such gates is
feed-forward, where one attempts to correct certain failure events that
occurred in the gate's operation. In this brief report we examine the role of
feed-forward in improving the success probability. In particular, for the
non-linear sign shift gate, we find that in a three-mode implementation with a
single round of feed-forward the optimal average probability of success is
approximately given by p= 0.272. This value is only slightly larger than the
general optimal success probability without feed-forward, P= 0.25.

on a relation to their classical counterparts. Explicitly, we show that
whenever chessboard estimates can be used to prove a phase transition in the
classical model, the corresponding quantum model will have a similar phase
transition, provided the inverse temperature $\beta$ and the magnitude of the
quantum spins $\CalS$ satisfy $\beta\ll\sqrt\CalS$. From the quantum system we
require that it is reflection positive and that it has a meaningful classical
limit; the core technical estimate may be described as an extension of the
Berezin-Lieb inequalities down to the level of matrix elements. The general
theory is applied to prove phase transitions in various quantum spin systems
with $\CalS\gg1$. The most notable examples are the quantum orbital-compass
model on $\Z^2$ and the quantum 120-degree model on $\Z^3$ which are shown to
exhibit symmetry breaking at low-temperatures despite the infinite degeneracy

- from a new point of view. In classical mechanics, an observable is
represented as a function (measurable, continuous or smooth), whereas in (von
Neumann's approach to) quantum physics, an observable is represented as a
bonded selfadjoint operator on Hilbert space. We will show in part II of this
work that there is a common structure behind these two different concepts. If
$\mathcal{R}$ is a von Neumann algebra, a selfadjoint element $A \in
\mathcal{R}$ induces a continuous function $f_{A} : \mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{P(R)})
\to \mathbb{R}$ defined on the \emph{Stone spectrum}
$\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{P(R)})$ of the lattice $\mathcal{P(R)}$ of projections in
$\mathcal{R}$. The Stone spectrum $\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{L})$ of a general
lattice $\mathbb{L}$ is the set of maximal dual ideals in $\mathbb{L}$,
equipped with a canonical topology. $\mathcal{Q}(\mathbb{L})$ coincides with
Stone's construction if $\mathbb{L}$ is a Boolean algebra (thereby ``Stone'')
and is homeomorphic to the Gelfand spectrum of an abelian von Neumann algebra
$\mathcal{R}$ in case of $\mathbb{L} = \mathcal{P(R)}$ (thereby ``spectrum'').

trapped Fermi gas of atoms at zero temperature. We apply Nambu-Gorkov formalism
of superconductivity to calculate the response function of superfluid gas due
to stimulated light scattering taking into account the final state
interactions. The polarization of light has been shown to play a significant
role in response of Cooper-pairs in the presence of a magnetic field.
Particularly important is a scheme of polarization-selective light scattering
by either spin-component of the Cooper-pairs leading to the single-particle
excitations of one spin-component only. These excitations have a threshold of
$2\Delta$ where $\Delta$ is the superfluid gap energy. Furthermore,
polarization-selective light scattering allows for unequal energy and momentum
transfer to the two partner atoms of a Cooper-pair. In the regime of low energy
($&lt;&lt; 2\Delta$) and low momentum ($&lt;2\Delta/(\hbar v_F)$, $v_F$ being the Fermi
velocity) transfer, a small difference in momentum transfers to the two
spin-components may be useful in exciting Bogoliubov-Anderson phonon mode. We
present detailed results on the dynamic structure factor (DSF) deduced from the
response function making use of generalized fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
Model calculations using local density approximation for trapped superfluid
Fermi gas shows that when the energy transfer is less than $2\Delta_0$, where
$\Delta_0$ refers to the gap at the trap center, DSF as a function of energy
transfer has reduced gradient compared to that of normal Fermi gas.

the mutually non-commuting variates in the quasi-probabilistic spin

one considers different characteristic functions or moments based on various
correspondence rules. As an example, discrete probability distribution for an
arbitrary spin-1 assembly is constructed using Wigner-Weyl and Margenau-Hill

combined electric quadrupole field and dipole magnetic field exhibits squeezing

channel, the photon-number-splitting (PNS) attack can make the quantum key
distribution (QKD) in practice totally insecure. Given the result of ILM-GLLP,
one knows how to distill the secure final key if he knows the fraction of
tagged bits. The purpose of decoy state method is to do a tight verification of
the the fraction of tagged bits. The main idea of decoy-state method is
changing the intensities of source light and one can verify the fraction of
tagged bits of certain intensity by watching the the counting rates of pulses
of different intensities. Since the counting rates are small quantities, the
effect of statistical fluctuation is very important. It has been shown that
3-state decoy-state method in practice can work even with the fluctuations and
other errors.

  Einstein's criticism of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics is
an important part of his legacy. Although most physicists consider Einstein's
criticism technically unfounded, we show that the Copenhagen interpretation is
actually incorrect, since Born's probability explanation of the wave function
is incorrect due to a false assumption on &quot;continuous probabilities&quot; in modern
probability theory. &quot;Continuous probability&quot; means a &quot;probability measure&quot; that
can take every value in a subinterval of the unit interval (0, 1). We prove
that such &quot;continuous probabilities&quot; are invalid. Since Bell's inequality also
assumes &quot;continuous probabilities&quot;, the result of the experimental test of
Bell's inequality is not evidence supporting the Copenhagen interpretation.
Although successful applications of quantum mechanics and explanation of
quantum phenomena do not necessarily rely on the Copenhagen interpretation, the
question asked by Einstein 70 years ago, i.e., whether a complete description
of reality exists, still remains open.

AlphaEta [2], claiming that these attacks undermine the security of AlphaEta
for both direct encryption and key generation. In this paper, we show that
their arguments fail in many different ways. In particular, the first attack in
[1] requires channel loss or length of known-plaintext that is exponential in
the key length and is unrealistic even for moderate key lengths. The second
attack is a Grover search attack based on `asymptotic orthogonality' and was
not analyzed quantitatively in [1]. We explain why it is not logically possible
to ``pull back'' an argument valid only at n=infinity into a limit statement,
let alone one valid for a finite number of transmissions n. We illustrate this
by a `proof' using a similar asymptotic orthogonality argument that
coherent-state BB84 is insecure for any value of loss. Even if a limit
statement is true, this attack is a priori irrelevant as it requires an
indefinitely large amount of known-plaintext, resources and processing. We also
explain why the attacks in [1] on AlphaEta as a key-generation system are based
on misinterpretations of [2]. Some misunderstandings in [1] regarding certain
issues in cryptography and optical communications are also pointed out. Short
of providing a security proof for AlphaEta, we provide a description of
relevant results in standard cryptography and in the design of AlphaEta to put
the above issues in the proper framework and to elucidate some security
features of this new approach to quantum cryptography.

purity characteristics for complementary CP maps coincide. Hence, validity of

maps as a proper subclass, resulting in new class of CP maps (channels) for
which the multiplicativity/additivity holds. Covariant and Gaussian channels

exist in the coupling of a two-level system with an oscillator, which is based
on nonlinearities in the laser-induced vibronic coupling. This mechanism is
exemplified with an ion confined in the potential well of a trap, where the
nonlinearities are due to Franck--Condon type overlap integrals of the laser
waves with the ionic centre-of-mass wavefunction. In contrast to the coherent
trapping mechanism known from micro-maser theory, this mechanism works also in
an incoherent regime operated by noisy lasers and is therefore much more robust
against external decoherence effects. These features favour the incoherent
regime, in particular for the preparation of highly excited trapping states.

both basic and practical importance. Among the relevant topics let us mention
entanglement and decoherence of macroscopic systems, together with applications
to quantum memory for long distance quantum cryptography. Although the first
experimental demonstrations have been performed in atomic vapors and clouds,
rare earth ion doped crystals are also interesting media for such processes. In
this paper we address Tm3+ ions capability to behave as three-level lambda
systems, a key ingredient to convert optical excitation into a spontaneous-
emission-free spin wave. Indeed Tm3+ falls within reach of light sources that
can be stabilized easily to the required degree. In the absence of zero-field
hyperfine structure we apply an external magnetic field to lift the nuclear
spin degeneracy in Tm3+:YAG. We experimentally determine the gyromagnetic
tensor components with the help of spectral hole-burning techniques. Then
appropriate orientation of the applied field enables us to optimize the
transition probability ratio along the two legs of the lambda. The resulting
three-level lambda system should suit quantum information processing
requirements.

low-power- consumption communication is proposed. The states of the information
bit are represented by two resistance values. The sender and the receiver have
such resistors available and they randomly select and connect one of them to
the channel at the beginning of each clock period. The thermal noise voltage
and current can be observed but Kirchoff's law provides only a second-order
equation. A secure bit is communicated when the actual resistance values at the
sender's side and the receiver's side differ. Then the second order equation
yields the two resistance values but the eavesdropper is unable to determine
the actual locations of the resistors and to find out the state of the sender's
bit. The receiver knows that the sender has the inverse of his bit, similarly
to quantum entanglement. The eavesdropper can decode the message if, for each
bits, she inject current in the wire and measures the voltage change and the
current changes in the two directions. However, in this way she gets discovered
by the very first bit she decodes. Instead of thermal noise, proper external

field in a spacetime with a reflecting boundary. The presence of the boundary
modifies the quantum fluctuations of the scalar field, which in turn modifies
the radiative properties of atoms. We calculate the rate of change of the mean
atomic energy of the atom for both inertial motion and uniform acceleration. It
is found that the modifications induced by the presence of a boundary make the
spontaneous radiation rate of an excited inertial atom to oscillate near the
boundary and this oscillatory behavior may offer a possible opportunity for
experimental tests for geometrical (boundary) effects in flat spacetime. While
for accelerated atoms, the transitions from ground states to excited states are
found to be possible even in vacuum due to changes in the vacuum fluctuations
induced by both the presence of the boundary and the acceleration of atoms, and
this can be regarded as an actual physical process underlying the Unruh effect.

irreversible dynamics is presented in two parts. The first part is concerned
exclusively with the description of the states of any individual physical
system. It is based on a new nonlinear quantum equation of motion, which
reduces to the Schroedinger equation of motion of motion of conventional
quantum dynamics only under special conditions. It accounts for the
implications of the laws of Thermodynamics as well as for irreversible
phenomena, such as the natural tendency of an isolated system to transit from
any non-equilibrium state to an equilibrium state of higher entropy.
Conversely, the laws of Thermodynamics and irreversibility emerge as
manifestations of the fundamental quantum dynamical behaviour of the elementary
constituents of any material system. We call this part Quantum Thermodynamics.
The second part of the theory, which contains the first as a special case, is
concerned with the description of stochastic distributions of states in an
ensemble of identical physical systems each of which individually obeys the
laws of Quantum Thermodynamics. It is based on a new measure-theoretic
description of ensembles. It accounts unambiguously for the essential
distinction between two types of uncertainties that are generally present in an
ensemble, namely, quantal uncertainties due to the inherent quantal nature of
the states of each individual member system and nonquantal uncertainties due to
the stochastic distribution of states. We call this part Quantum Statistical
Thermodynamics.

Rayleigh-fading channels with $N$ inputs (transmitters) and $M$ outputs

  The main issues addressed are the condition of statistical stability, the
rate of information transfer and the effect of pinholes. The stability
condition is proved to be $MC\ll N_{\rm eff}B$ for broadband channels and $M\ll
N_{\rm eff}$ for narrowband channels where $C$ is the symbol rate, $B$ is the
bandwidth and $N_{\rm eff}$ is the {\em effective} number of transmitters. It
is shown that when the number of layers, $n-1$, is relatively low compared to
the logarithm of numbers of pinholes $N_{\rm eff}$ is given by $n^{-1}$ times
the harmonic mean of the number of transmitters and the numbers of pinholes at
all layers. On the other hand, when the number of layers is relatively large
the effective number of pinholes diminishes exponentially. The energy
efficiency is shown to be optimal when the power supply is set to the noise
level times $BN_{\rm eff}$ and that the maximal information rate is roughly
$BN_{\rm eff}$ when the stability condition is violated.

  Multiplicativity</title><description>  Quantum channels can be described via a unitary coupling of system and
environment, followed by a trace over the environment state space. Taking the
trace instead over the system state space produces a different mapping which we
call the conjugate channel. We explore the properties of conjugate channels and
describe several different methods of construction. In general, conjugate
channels map M_d to M_d' with d &lt; d', and different constructions may differ by
conjugation with a partial isometry.
  We show that a channel and its conjugate have the same minimal output entropy
and maximal output p-norm. It then follows that the additivity and
multiplicativity conjectures for these measures of optimal output purity hold
for a product of channels if and only if they also hold for the product of
their conjugates. This allows us to reduce these conjectures to the special
case of maps taking M_d to M_d' with a minimal representation of dimension at
most d.
  We find explicit expressions for the conjugates for a number of well-known
examples, including entanglement-breaking channels, unital qubit channels, the
depolarizing channel, and a subclass of random unitary channels. For the
entanglement-breaking channels, channels this yields a new class of channels
for which additivity and multiplicativity of optimal output purity can be
established. For random unitary channels using the generalized Pauli matrices,
we obtain a new formulation of the multiplicativity conjecture. The conjugate
of the completely noisy channel plays a special role and suggests a mechanism
for using noise to transmit information.

accepts an increase in the measured variances. A necessary condition for a
joint measurement to be possible is that a joint probability distribution
exists for the measurement. This fact suggests that there may be a link with
Bell inequalities, as these will be satisfied if and only if a joint
probability distribution for all involved observables exists. We investigate
the connections between Bell inequalities and conditions for joint quantum
measurements to be possible. Mermin's inequality for the three-particle
Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state turns out to be equivalent to the condition
for a joint measurement on two out of the three quantum systems to exist.
Gisin's Bell inequality for three co-planar measurement directions, meanwhile,
is shown to be less strict than the condition for the corresponding joint
measurement.

longstanding problem, based on a universally-applicable formalism for ensembles
on configuration space. This approach overcomes difficulties arising in

ensemble, conservation of probability and energy, and the correct classical
equations of motion in the limit of no interaction. Applications include
automatic decoherence for quantum ensembles interacting with classical
measurement apparatuses; a generalisation of coherent states to hybrid harmonic
oscillators; and an equation for describing the interaction of quantum matter
fields with classical gravity, that implies the radius of a Robertson-Walker
universe with a quantum massive scalar field can be sharply defined only for

Bayesian reasoning and whether such an analysis helps clarify the
interpretation of such theories. First, we summarise and extend recent work
categorising two different approaches to formalising multi-time measurements in
quantum theory. The standard approach consists of describing an ordered series
of measurements in terms of history propositions with non-additive
`probabilities'. The non-standard approach consists of defining multi-time
measurements to consist of sets of exclusive and exhaustive history
propositions and recovering the single-time exclusivity of results when
discussing single-time history propositions. We analyse whether such history
propositions can be consistent with Bayes' rule. We show that certain class of
histories are given a natural Bayesian interpretation, namely the linearly
positive histories originally introduced by Goldstein and Page. Thus we argue
that this gives a certain amount of interpretational clarity to the
non-standard approach. We also attempt a justification of our analysis using
Cox's axioms of probability theory.

  Our protocol is optimal among all similar protocols in terms of wide

depending on the choice of the measure. The key of the proof of optimality is
the following fact, which is a consequence of the symmetry-based construction

modifications of the protocol only in its classical output, or the claim on the

  We also observe that the classical part of the output of the protocol gives a

  on generic lattices</title><description>  We investigate the relationship between the gap between the energy of the
ground state and the first excited state and the decay of correlation functions
in harmonic lattice systems. We prove that in gapped systems, the exponential
decay of correlations follows for both the ground state and thermal states.
Considering the converse direction, we show that an energy gap can follow from
algebraic decay and always does for exponential decay. The underlying lattices
are described as general graphs of not necessarily integer dimension, including
translationally invariant instances of cubic lattices as special cases. Any
local quadratic couplings in position and momentum coordinates are allowed for,
leading to quasi-free (Gaussian) ground states. We make use of methods of
deriving bounds to matrix functions of banded matrices corresponding to local
interactions on general graphs. Finally, we give an explicit entanglement-area
relationship in terms of the energy gap for arbitrary, not necessarily
contiguous regions on lattices characterized by general graphs.

distribution and long lifetime. This thesis concerns various related aspects of
quantum information processing with single photons. Firstly, we demonstrate
N-photon entanglement generation through a generalised N X N symmetric beam
splitter known as the Bell multiport. A wide variety of 4-photon entangled
states as well as the N-photon W-state can be generated with an unexpected
non-monotonic decreasing probability of success with N. We also show how the
same setup can be used to generate multiatom entanglement. A further study of
multiports also leads us to a multiparticle generalisation of the
Hong-Ou-Mandel dip which holds for all Bell multiports of even number of input
ports. Next, we demonstrate a generalised linear optics based photon filter
that has a constant success probability regardless of the number of photons
involved. This filter has the highest reported success probability and is
interferometrically robust. Finally, we demonstrate how repeat-until-success
quantum computing can be performed with two distant nodes with unit success
probability using only linear optics resource. We further show that using
non-identical photon sources, robustness can still be achieved, an illustration
of the nature and advantages of measurement-based quantum computation. A direct
application to the same setup leads naturally to arbitrary multiphoton state
generation on demand. Finally, we demonstrate how polarisation entanglement of
photons can be detected from the emission of two atoms in a Young's double-slit
type experiment without linear optics, resulting in both atoms being also
maximally entangled.

the help of sequential measurements of two non-commuting observables only. We
show that the overall success probability is maximized in the case of measuring
two observables whose eigenstates define mutually unbiased bases. We find that
for this optimal case the success probability quickly converges to unity as the
number of measurement processes increases and that it is almost independent of
the initial state. In particular, we show that to guarantee a success
probability close to one the number of consecutive measurements must be larger
than the dimension of the Hilbert space. We connect these results to quantum

  trajectories</title><description>  We study various measures of classicality of the states of open quantum
systems subject to decoherence. Classical states are expected to be stable in
spite of decoherence, and are thought to leave conspicuous imprints on the
environment. Here these expected features of environment-induced superselection
(einselection) are quantified using four different criteria: predictability
sieve (which selects states that produce least entropy), purification time
(which looks for states that are the easiest to find out from the imprint they
leave on the environment), efficiency threshold (which finds states that can be
deduced from measurements on a smallest fraction of the environment), and
purity loss time (that looks for states for which it takes the longest to lose
a set fraction of their initial purity). We show that when pointer states --
the most predictable states of an open quantum system selected by the
predictability sieve -- are well defined, all four criteria agree that they are
indeed the most classical states. We illustrate this with two examples: an
underdamped harmonic oscillator, for which coherent states are unanimously
chosen by all criteria, and a free particle undergoing quantum Brownian motion,
for which most criteria select almost identical Gaussian states (although, in
this case, predictability sieve does not select well defined pointer states.)

However, this is not the case when we are encrypting quantum bits. For the
perfect encryption of n quantum bits, 2n bits of entropy are necessary and
sufficient (quantum one-time pad), but for approximate encryption one
asymptotically needs only n bits of entropy. In this paper, we provide the
optimal trade-off between the approximation measure epsilon and the amount of
classical entropy used in the encryption of single quantum bits. Then, we
consider n-qubit encryption schemes which are a composition of independent
single-qubit ones and provide the optimal schemes both in the 2- and the
operator-norm. Moreover, we provide a counterexample to show that the
encryption scheme of Ambainis-Smith based on small-bias sets does not work in

trapped in separated wells of a polarization-gradient optical lattice, and
interacting through a multichannel scattering process. Due to the anomalously
large scattering length of cesium dimers, a strong coupling can occur between
vibrational states of the trap and a weakly bound molecular state that is made
resonant by the ac-Stark shift of the lattice. We calculate the energy spectrum
of the two-atom system as a function of the distance between two potential
wells by connecting the solutions of the Schroedinger equation for the
short-range molecular potential to that of the long-range trap in a
self-consistent manner. The short-range potential is treated through a
multichannel pseudopotential, parametrized by the K matrix, calculated
numerically for atoms in free space in a close-coupling approximation. This
captures both the bound molecular spectrum as well as the energy-dependent
scattering for all partial waves. We establish realistic operating conditions
under which the trap-induced resonance could be observed and show that this
strong and coherent interaction could be used as a basis for high-fidelity
two-qubit quantum logic operations.

theories with particle trajectories) is different from that in orthodox quantum
theory. More precisely, there are two concepts of superselection rule, a weak
and a strong one. Weak superselection rules exist both in orthodox quantum
theory and in Bohm-Bell theories and represent the conventional understanding
of superselection rules. We introduce the concept of strong superselection
rule, which does not exist in orthodox quantum theory. It relies on the clear
ontology of Bohm-Bell theories and is a sharper and, in the Bohm-Bell context,
more fundamental notion. A strong superselection rule for the observable G
asserts that one can replace every state vector by a suitable statistical
mixture of eigenvectors of G without changing the particle trajectories or
their probabilities. A weak superselection rule asserts that every state vector
is empirically indistinguishable from a suitable statistical mixture of
eigenvectors of G. We establish conditions on G for both kinds of
superselection. For comparison, we also consider both kinds of superselection
in theories of spontaneous wave function collapse.

regions of the spectra, (i) the dimerized region of long-range ordered

(localized) &quot;kink lattice&quot; of avoiding levels, and (iii) the intermediate
region of kink nucleation with variable range of ordering. This structure
appears above a certain critical line as a function of interaction strength.
The level clustering and level avoiding generic patterns reflect themselves in
several intermittent regions between up to three branches of spectral
entropies. Linear scaling behavior of the widths of level curvature probability
distributions provides the conventionally adopted indication for the presence
of quantum chaos. Level spacing probability distributions show peculiarities of
the partial (for fixed quantum angular momentum) as well as of the cumulative

thus our works may be regarded as a starting point towards the construction of

can be obtained by projective measurements alone, with no need for unitary
gates. This suggests that the underlying logic of quantum computing may be an
algebra of sequences of quantum measurements rather than an algebra of products
of unitary operators. Such a Sequential Quantum Logic (SQL) was developed in
the late 70's and has more recently been applied to the consistent histories
framework of quantum mechanics as a possible route to the theory of quantum
gravity. In this letter, I give a method for deciding the truth of a

  for Quantum Gravity</title><description>  Quantum theory is a probabilistic theory with fixed causal structure. General
relativity is a deterministic theory but where the causal structure is dynamic.
It is reasonable to expect that quantum gravity will be a probabilistic theory
with dynamic causal structure. The purpose of this paper is to present a
framework for such a probability calculus. We define an operational notion of
space-time, this being composed of elementary regions. Central to this
formalism is an object we call the causaloid. This object captures information
about causal structure implicit in the data by quantifying the way in which the
number of measurements required to establish a state for a composite region is
reduced when there is a causal connection between the component regions. This
formalism puts all elementary regions on an equal footing. It does not require
that we impose fixed causal structure. In particular, it is not necessary to
assume the existence of a background time. Remarkably, given the causaloid, we
can calculate all relevant probabilities and so the causaloid is sufficient to
specify the predictive aspect of a physical theory. We show how certain
causaloids can be represented by suggestive diagrams and we show how to
represent both classical probability theory and quantum theory by a causaloid.
We do not give a causaloid formulation for general relativity though we
speculate that this is possible. The work presented here suggests a research
program aimed at finding a theory of quantum gravity. The idea is to use the
causaloid formalism along with principles taken from the two theories to marry
the dynamic causal structure of general relativity with the probabilistic
structure of quantum theory.

We are given an oracle that knows
all the entries of k matrices, that is, we can query the oracle an (i,j) entry
of the l-th matrix. The goal is to test if each pair of k matrices commute with
each other or not with as few queries to the oracle as possible. In order to
solve this problem, we use a theorem of Mario Szegedy (quant-ph/0401053) that
relates a hitting time of a classical random walk to that of a quantum walk. We
also take a look at another method of quantum walk by Andris Ambainis
(quant-ph/0311001). We apply both walks into triangle finding problem
(quant-ph/0310134) and matrix verification problem (quant-ph/0409035) to
compare the powers of the two different walks. We also present Ambainis's
method of lower bounding technique (quant-ph/0002066) to obtain a lower bound
for this problem. It turns out Szegedy's algorithm can be generalized to solve
similar problems. Therefore we use Szegedy's theorem to analyze the problem of
matrix set commutativity. We give an O(k^{4/5}n^{9/5}) algorithm as well as a
lower bound of Omega(k^{1/2}n). We generalize the technique used in coming up
with the upper bound to solve a broader range of similar problems. This is
probably the first problem to be studied on the quantum query complexity using
quantum walks that involves more than one parameter, here, k and n.

calculate the concurrence, negativity, and von Neumann entropy. The
entanglement of the two Kondo impurities is shown to be determined by two
competing many-body effects, the Kondo effect and the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, $I$. Due to the
spin-rotational invariance of the ground state, the concurrence and negativity
are uniquely determined by the spin-spin correlation between the impurities. It
is found that there exists a critical minimum value of the antiferromagnetic
correlation between the impurity spins which is necessary for entanglement of
the two impurity spins. The critical value is discussed in relation with the
unstable fixed point in the two impurity Kondo problem. Specifically, at the
fixed point there is no entanglement between the impurity spins. Entanglement
will only be created (and quantum information processing (QIP) be possible) if
the RKKY interaction exchange energy, $I$, is at least several times larger
than the Kondo temperature, $T_K$. Quantitative criteria for QIP are given in
terms of the impurity spin-spin correlation.

$\mathcal{P(R)}$ of projections in $\mathcal{R}$. $f_{A}$ is called the

distribution in the horizontal and vertical polarizations remains sharply
defined for phase shifts of up to 1/n between the circularly polarized
components. Phase shifts at the Heisenberg limit are therefore observed as
nearly deterministic transfers of a single photon between the horizontal and
vertical polarization components.

realism. In particular, we show that there is a two-setting Bell inequality for
every nontrivial graph state which is violated by the state at least by a
factor of two. These inequalities are facets of the convex polytope containing
the many-body correlations consistent with local hidden variable models. We
first present a method which assigns a Bell inequality for each graph vertex.
Then for some families of graph states composite Bell inequalities can be
constructed with a violation of local realism increasing exponentially with the
number of qubits. We also suggest a systematic way for obtaining Bell

attack on Bennett-Brassard 1984 quantum key distribution by means of a single
controlled-NOT gate in which Alice's transmitted qubit becomes the
control-qubit input, Bob's received qubit is the control-qubit output, and Eve
supplies the target-qubit input and measures the target-qubit output. The FPB
probe uses the minimum-error-probability projective measurement for
discriminating between the target-qubit output states that are perfectly
correlated with Bob's sifted bit value when that bit is correctly received.
This paper analyzes a recently proposed modification of the FPB attack in which
Eve's projective measurement is replaced by a probability operator-valued

topic; And unified theory is in physics frontier; But because the principles of
quantum physics and relativity are so different, any theories of trying to
unify 4 nature forces should not be considered as completed without truly
unifying the basic principles between QM and relativity. This paper will
interpret quantum physics by using two extra dimensional time as quantum hidden
variables. I'll show that three dimensional time is a bridge to connect basics
quantum physics, relativity and string theory. ``Quantum potential'' in Bohm's
quantum hidden variable theory is derived from Einstein Lagrangian in
6-dimensional time-space geometry. Statistical effect in the measurement of
single particle, non-local properties, de Broglie wave can be naturally derived
from the natural properties of three dimensional time. Berry phase, double-slit
interference of single particle, uncertainty relation, wave-packet collapse are
discussed. The spin and g factor are derived from geometry of extra two time
dimensions. Electron can be expressed as time monopole. In the last part of
this paper, I'll discuss the relation between three dimensional time and
unified theory.

problems is presented, which is useful in situations where the evolution of the
Hamiltonian is slow. The state of a system which starts in an instantaneous
eigenstate of the initial Hamiltonian is written as a power series which has a
straightforward diagrammatic representation. Each term of the series
corresponds to a sequence of &quot;adiabatic&quot; evolutions, during which the system
remains in an instantaneous eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, punctuated by
transitions from one state to another. The first term of this series is the
standard adiabatic evolution, the next is the well-known first correction to
it, and subsequent terms can be written down essentially by inspection.
Although the final result is perhaps not terribly surprising, it seems to be
not widely known, and the interpretation is new, as far as we know. Application
of the method to the adiabatic approximation is given, and some discussion of
the validity of this approximation is presented.

Specifically, in this paper, we investigate SARG04 with two-way classical
communications and SARG04 with decoy states. In the first part of the paper, we
show that SARG04 with two-way communications can tolerate a higher bit error
rate (19.4% for a one-photon source and 6.56% for a two-photon source) than
SARG04 with one-way communications (10.95% for a one-photon source and 2.71%
for a two-photon source). Also, the upper bounds on the bit error rate for
SARG04 with two-way communications are computed in a closed form by considering
an individual attack based on a general measurement. In the second part of the
paper, we propose employing the idea of decoy states in SARG04 to obtain
unconditional security even when realistic devices are used. We compare the
performance of SARG04 with decoy states and BB84 with decoy states. We find
that the optimal mean-photon number for SARG04 is higher than that of BB84 when
the bit error rate is small. Also, we observe that SARG04 does not achieve a

the existence of NPT bound entanglement. In the past years, little progress has
been made, mainly because of the lack of mathematical tools to address the
problem. (i) In an attempt to overcome this, we show how the distillability
problem can be reformulated as a special instance of the separability problem,
for which a large number of tools and techniques are available. (ii) Building
up to this we also show how the problem can be formulated as a Schmidt number
problem. (iii) A numerical method for detecting distillability is presented and
strong evidence is given that all 1-copy undistillable Werner states are also
4-copy undistillable. (iv) The same method is used to estimate the volume of
distillable states, and the results suggest that bound entanglement is
primarily a phenomenon found in low dimensional quantum systems. (v) Finally, a
set of one parameter states is presented which we conjecture to exhibit all

wich contain both regular and chaotic environments. In all cases the system of
interest is a &quot;quantum walker&quot;, i.e. a quantum particle that can move on a
lattice with a finite number of sites. The walker interacts with an environment
wich has a D dimensional Hilbert space. The results we obtain suggest that
regular and chaotic environments are not distinguishable from each other in a

t*~log(D). Howeber, chaotic environments continue to be effective over
exponentially longer timescales while regular environments tend to reach
saturation much sooner. We present both numerical and analytical results
supporting this conclusion. The family of chaotic evolutions we consider
includes the so-called quantum multi-baker-map as a particular case.

Specifically, we calculate the predictions for the change in position of a

of radiation reaction in the one-photon-emission process in quantum
electrodynamics. The scalar particle is assumed to be accelerated for a finite

obtained in classical electrodynamics with the Lorentz-Dirac force treated as a

electromagnetic potential that the forward-scattering amplitude at order $e^2$
does not contribute to the position change in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit after the

$X_j=(x^j_1,x^j_2,..., x^j_n), 1\leq j\leq m$ and $t_B(x_i^1x_i^2... x_i^m)=1$
for input $m$-tuples $x_i^1x_i^2...x_i^m\in B\subseteq A\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$,
and 0, if $x_i^1x_i^2...x_i^m\in A\setminus B$. Here the set $A$ is the input
{\it promise} set for function $f_B$. The input vectors $X_j, 1\leq j\leq m$
are given to the $m\geq 3$ parties respectively, who communicate cbits in a
distributed environment so that one of them (say Alice) comes up with the value
of the function. We algebraically characterize entanglement assisted LOCC

boolean functions $f_B$, for certain sets $B\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$, for $m\geq 3$
parties under appropriate uniform parity promise restrictions on input

deterministic setup. In contrast, for certain $m$-party accumulative boolean

$m$-tuples so that $m-1$ cbits of communication suffice in computing the
functions in the absence of any a priori quantum entanglement. We compactly
represent all these protocols and the corresponding input promise restrictions
using uniform group theoretic and hamming distance characterizations.

Macroscopic quantum jumps manifest themselves as a random telegraph signal with
long intervals of intense fluorescence (light periods) interrupted by the

how their bipartite entanglement can be accurately quantified in terms of the
global and local amounts of mixedness, and efficiently estimated by direct
measurements of the associated purities. For multimode Gaussian states endowed
with local symmetry with respect to a given bipartition, we show how the
multimode block entanglement can be completely and reversibly localized onto a
single pair of modes by local, unitary operations. We then analyze the
distribution of entanglement among multiple parties in multimode Gaussian
states. We introduce the continuous-variable tangle to quantify entanglement
sharing in Gaussian states and we prove that it satisfies the
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy inequality. Nevertheless, we show that pure,
symmetric three-mode Gaussian states, at variance with their discrete-variable
counterparts, allow a promiscuous sharing of quantum correlations, exhibiting
both maximum tripartite residual entanglement and maximum couplewise
entanglement between any pair of modes. Finally, we investigate the connection
between multipartite entanglement and the optimal fidelity in a
continuous-variable quantum teleportation network. We show how the fidelity can
be maximized in terms of the best preparation of the shared entangled resources
and, viceversa, that this optimal fidelity provides a clearcut operational
interpretation of several measures of bipartite and multipartite entanglement,
including the entanglement of formation, the localizable entanglement, and the
continuous-variable tangle.

encode a qubit into a continuous variable quantum system. This encoding was
realized by using non-normalizable quantum codewords, which therefore can only
be approximated in any real physical setup. Here we show how a neutral atom,
falling through an optical cavity and interacting with a single mode of the
intracavity electromagnetic field, can be used to safely encode a qubit into
its external degrees of freedom. In fact, the localization induced by a
homodyne detection of the cavity field is able to project the near-field atomic
motional state into an approximate quantum codeword. The performance of this
encoding process is then analyzed by evaluating the intrinsic errors induced in
the recovery process by the approximated form of the generated codeword.

dielectric plates is reconsidered on the basis of thermal quantum field theory
in Matsubara formulation. We briefly review two main derivations of the
Lifshitz formula in the framework of thermal quantum field theory without use
of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. A set of special conditions is
formulated under which these derivations remain valid in the presence of
dissipation. The low-temperature behavior of the Casimir and van der Waals
interactions between dissimilar dielectrics is found analytically from the
Lifshitz theory for both an idealized model of dilute dielectrics and for real
dielectrics with finite static dielectric permittivities. The free energy,
pressure and entropy of the Casimir and van der Waals interactions at low
temperatures demonstrate the same universal dependence on the temperature as
was previously discovered for ideal metals. The entropy vanishes when
temperature goes to zero proving the validity of the Nernst heat theorem. This
solves the long-standing problem on the consistency of the Lifshitz theory with
thermodynamics in the case of dielectric plates. The obtained asymptotic
expressions are compared with numerical computations for both dissimilar and
similar real dielectrics and found to be in excellent agreement. The role of
the zero-frequency term in Matsubara sum is investigated in the case of
dielectric plates. It is shown that the inclusion of conductivity in the model
of dielectric response leads to the violation of the Nernst heat theorem. The
applications of this result to the topical problems of noncontact atomic

Using the Lippmann-Schwinger equations as the takeoff point and aiming for a

detected observables. Suggested by the two signs $\pm i\epsilon$ of the

conventional quantum mechanics by two Hardy spaces. The new Hardy space theory
automatically provides Gamow kets with exponential time evolution derived from
the complex poles of the $S$-matrix. It solves the causality problem since it
results in a semigroup evolution. But this semigroup brings into quantum

absence of such classical matter fields, quantum mechanics should be formulated
without reference to a classical time. If such a new formulation exists, it
follows as a consequence that standard linear quantum mechanics is a limiting
case of an underlying non-linear quantum theory. A possible approach to the new
formulation is through the use of noncommuting spacetime coordinates in
noncommutative differential geometry. Here, the non-linear theory is described
by a non-linear Schrodinger equation which belongs to the Doebner-Goldin class
of equations, discovered some years ago. This mass-dependent non-linearity is
significant when particle masses are comparable to Planck mass, and negligible
otherwise. Such a non-linearity is in principle detectable through experimental
tests of quantum mechanics for mesoscopic systems, and is a valuable empirical
probe of theories of quantum gravity. We also briefly remark on the possible

normal-state single-electron transistor (SET). Starting from a microscopic
description of the system, we derive a master equation for the SET island
charge and resonator which is valid in the limit of weak electro-mechanical
coupling. Using this master equation we show that, apart from brief transients,
the resonator always behaves like a damped harmonic oscillator with a shifted
frequency and relaxes into a thermal-like steady state. Although the behaviour
remains qualitatively the same, we find that the magnitude of the resonator
damping rate and frequency shift depend very sensitively on the relative
magnitudes of the resonator period and the electron tunnelling time. Maximum
damping occurs when the electrical and mechanical time-scales are the same, but
the frequency shift is greatest when the resonator moves much more slowly than
the island charge. We then derive reduced master equations which describe just
the resonator dynamics. By making slightly different approximations, we obtain
two different reduced master equations for the resonator. Apart from minor
differences, the two reduced master equations give rise to a consistent picture
of the resonator dynamics which matches that obtained from the master equation
including the SET island charge.

  effect</title><description>  Some recent theoretical studies have tended to employ analytically-continuous
{\em gaussian}, or infinite-bandwidth step pulses to examine tunneling process.
The stationary phase method is often employed to this aim. However, {\em
gaussian} functions do not have a well-defined front, such that their speed of
propagation becomes ambiguous. Also, infinite bandwidth signals cannot
propagate through any real physical medium (whose transfer function is
therefore finite) without pulse distortion, which also leads to ambiguities in
determining propagation velocity during the tunneling process. In this
manuscript, we appoint some incompatibilities with the application of the
method of stationary phase in deriving tunneling times which, eventually, can
ruin the {\em superluminal} interpretation of transition times.

of length L, large compared to the correlation length. In the ground state, by
tracing out all degrees of freedom in the exterior of the disk, we obtain a
marginal density operator \rho for the degrees of freedom in the interior. The
von Neumann entropy S(\rho) of this density operator, a measure of the
entanglement of the interior and exterior variables, has the form S(\rho)=
\alpha L -\gamma + ..., where the ellipsis represents terms that vanish in the

localized near the boundary, is nonuniversal and ultraviolet divergent, but
-\gamma is a universal additive constant characterizing a global feature of the

linearized theory summarized in a Shchr\&quot;odinger--like (\Sl) equation. The
space charge effects have been introduced in a recent paper~\cite{prstab} by
coupling this \Sl equation with the Maxwell equations. We analyze the space
charge effects to understand how the dynamics produces the actual beam
distributions, and in particular we show how the stationary, self--consistent
solutions are related to the (external, and space--charge) potentials both when
we suppose that the external field is harmonic (\emph{constant focusing}), and
when we \emph{a priori} prescribe the shape of the stationary solution. We then
proceed to discuss a few new ideas~\cite{epac04} by introducing the generalized
Student distributions, namely non--Gaussian, L\'evy \emph{infinitely divisible}
(but not \emph{stable}) distributions. We will discuss this idea from two
different standpoints: (a) first by supposing that the stationary distribution
of our (Wiener powered) SM model is a Student distribution; (b) by supposing
that our model is based on a (non--Gaussian) L\'evy process whose increments
are Student distributed. We show that in the case (a) the longer tails of the
power decay of the Student laws, and in the case (b) the discontinuities of the
L\'evy--Student process can well account for the rare escape of particles from
the beam core, and hence for the formation of a halo in intense beams.

All such tests for bi-partite and multi-partite entanglement correspond to
hyperplanes in the set of second moments. It is shown that all optimal tests,
those that are most robust against imperfections with respect to some figure of
merit for a given state, can be constructed from solutions to semi-definite
optimization problems. Moreover, we show that for each such test, referred to
as entanglement witness based on second moments, there is a one-to-one
correspondence between the witness and a stronger product criterion, which
amounts to a non-linear witness, based on the same measurements. This
generalizes the known product criteria. The presented tests are all applicable
also to non-Gaussian states. To provide a service to the community, we present

measurements; however, the long-standing mathematical formulation established
by Heisenberg, Kennard, and Robertson does not allow such an interpretation.
Recently, a new relation was found to give a universally valid relation between
noise and disturbance in general quantum measurements, and it has become clear
that the new relation plays a role of the first principle to derive various
quantum limits on measurement and information processing in a unified
treatment. This paper examines the above development on the noise-disturbance
uncertainty principle in the model-independent approach based on the
measurement operator formalism, which is widely accepted to describe a class of
generalized measurements in the field of quantum information. We obtain
explicit formulas for the noise and disturbance of measurements given by the
measurement operators, and show that projective measurements do not satisfy the
Heisenberg-type noise-disturbance relation that is typical in the gamma-ray
microscope thought experiments. We also show that the disturbance on a Pauli
operator of a projective measurement of another Pauli operator constantly
equals the square root of 2, and examine how this measurement violates the
Heisenberg-type relation but satisfies the new noise-disturbance relation.

problem, as well as a geometric account of quantum entanglement and
non-separability that satisfies locality per special relativity and is free of

problematic for a spacetime conception of reality, and conclude by speculating
on RBW's implications for quantum gravity.

mechanics is a new theory of probability. The theory, like its classical
counterpart, consists of an algebra of events, and the probability measures
defined on it. The construction proceeds in the following steps: (a) Axioms for
the algebra of events are introduced following Birkhoff and von Neumann. All
axioms, except the one that expresses the uncertainty principle, are shared
with the classical event space. The only models for the set of axioms are
lattices of subspaces of inner product spaces over a field K. (b) Another axiom
due to Soler forces K to be the field of real, or complex numbers, or the
quaternions. We suggest a probabilistic reading of Soler's axiom. (c) Gleason's
theorem fully characterizes the probability measures on the algebra of events,
so that Born's rule is derived. (d) Gleason's theorem is equivalent to the
existence of a certain finite set of rays, with a particular orthogonality
graph (Wondergraph). Consequently, all aspects of quantum probability can be
derived from rational probability assignments to finite &quot;quantum gambles&quot;. We
apply the approach to the analysis of entanglement, Bell inequalities, and the
quantum theory of macroscopic objects. We also discuss the relation of the
present approach to quantum logic, realism and truth, and the measurement
problem.

non-linear equations connected with contraction of a Lie algebra. One fine
grading that is always present in any Lie algebra $sl(n,\mathbb{C})$ is the

  In this paper, we deal with a more complicated situation, namely that the
fine grading of $sl(p^2, \mathbb{C})$ is given by a tensor product of the Pauli

 We evaluate its asymptotic behavior expressed in the form of a limit
probability distribution of a double horn shape. Questions of robustness and
control of that limit distribution are addressed by introducing a quantum
optical cavity in which a resonant Jaynes-Cummings type of interaction between
the quantum walk coin system realized in the form of a two-level atom and a
laser field is taking place. Driving the optical cavity by means of the
coin-field interaction time and the initial quantum coin state, we determine
two types of modification of the asymptotic behavior of the QRW. In the first
one the limit distribution is robustly reproduced up to a scaling, while in the
second one the quantum features of the walk, exemplified by enhanced diffusion
rate, are washed out and Gaussian asymptotics prevail. Verification of these
findings in an experimental setup that involves two quantum optical cavities
that implement the driven QRW and its quantum to classical transition is

We then proceed to interpret the soliton wave function as describing a particle

wave function shows spatio-temporal internal vibration with angular frequency
and wave number that are determined by the energy-momentum of the particle as
firstly conjectured by de Broglie. Imposing resonance of the internal vibration
inside the spatio-temporal support leads to Planck-Einstein quantization of
energy-momentum. The first resonance mode is shown to recover the classical

the linearity of the Schr\&quot;odinger equation allows one to construct many

first to investigate the lost ring between the customary three methods and the
recently developed ones, as possible. For this purpose it has been devised
general analytic descriptions, which successfully demonstrate how different

systematize the recently introduced generalized CSs in a clear and concise way.
It will be clear also, that how our results can be considered as a first step
in the generation process of the mathematical physics CSs in the context of
quantum optics. Besides this, some new results emerge from our studies. I
introduce a large classes of generalized CSs, namely the {\it &quot;dual family&quot;}
associated with each set of early known CSs. But, in this relation, the
previous processes for constructing the dual pair of Gazeau-Klauder CSs fail to
work well, so I outlined a rather different method based on the {\it &quot;temporal

The purpose of this letter is to examine the vortex hypothesis in light of a

Vortices occur in pairs that perform a sort of quantum computation by

  invariance: superluminal phenomena, particles transformations</title><description>  The refinement and specifications of time-energy uncertainty relations have
shown that the experimentally observed phenomena of superluminal signaling are
describable by such their form: $\Delta E\Delta\tau\geq\pi\hbar$, where both
standard deviations are negative. When $\Delta\tau&lt;0$, these evanescent photons
would be instantly tunneling from one light cone into another on the distance
$c| \Delta\tau| $. (This assertion, previously proved via dispersion relations,
is described here by the temporal parameters of process.) Special forms of
these relations describe the transmutation of particles into their partners of
bigger mass, in $K^{0}$ and $B^{0}$ cases and at the $\nu$'s transmutations.
Thus, the violations of relativistic causality by evanescent particles can be
considered as the tunneling, as an analog of the short-term violation of
conservation laws at virtual transitions. The absence of Lorentz invariance at
such transitions can, probably, allow violations of some other symmetries.

investigated and related. Based on minimal data provided by the underlying
bialgebras of functions defined on e. g the real line R, the abelian finite
group Z_N, and the canonical Heisenberg-Weyl algebra hw, and by introducing
appropriate functionals on those algebras, examples of ARWs are constructed.
These walks involve short and long range transition probabilities as in the
case of R walk, bistochastic matrices as for the case of Z_N walk, or coherent
state vectors as in the case of hw walk. The increase of classical entropy due
to majorization order of those ARWs is shown, and further their corresponding
evolution equations are obtained. Especially for the case of hw ARW, the
diffusion limit of evolution equation leads to a quantum master equation for
the density matrix of a boson system interacting with a bath of quantum
oscillators prepared in squeezed vacuum state. A number of generalizations to
other types of ARWs and some open problems are also stated. Next, QRWs are
briefly presented together with some of their distinctive properties, such as
their enhanced diffusion rates, and their behavior in respect to the relation
of majorization to quantum entropy. Finally, the relation of ARWs to QRWs is
investigated in terms of the theorem of unitary extension of completely
positive trace preserving (CPTP) evolution maps by means of auxiliary vector
spaces. It is applied to extend the CPTP step evolution map of a ARW for a
quantum walker system into a unitary step evolution map for an associated QRW
of a walker+quantum coin system. Examples and extensions are provided.

reaction and vacuum electromagnetic fluctuation forces. Here we consider the
simple case of a nonrelativistic charged harmonic oscillator, in one dimension,
to investigate how to take into account the radiation reaction and vacuum
fluctuation forces within the Schrodinger picture. We consider the effects of
both classical zero-point and thermal electromagnetic vacuum fields. We show
that the zero-point electromagnetic fluctuations are dynamically related to the

introduction of the zero-point electromagnetic fields in the vector potential
A_x(t) used in the Schrodinger equation, generates ``double counting'', as was
shown recently by A.J. Faria et al. (Physics Letters A 305 (2002) 322). We
explain, in details, how to avoid the ``double counting'' by introducing only

product state gives rise to an entangled state. This suggests that even if
there is no interaction present between the subsystems, i.e., at each time
instant the state is non-entangled, the tangent vector is typically entangled.
Since the tangent space vectors tell the state-space vectors how to change this
implies that quantum entanglement is necessary for motion or change in general.
This is truly a `hidden power' of quantum entanglement. During quantum
computation even though at each time instant the state is not entangled,
quantum entanglement guides the process of computation. This observation
applies to multi-particle pure, pseudo-pure and mixed states as well.

time for a classical walk, the quantum hitting time must involve repeated
measurements as well as unitary evolution. We derive an expression for hitting
time using superoperators, and numerically evaluate it for the discrete walk on
the hypercube. The values found are compared to other analogues of hitting time
suggested in earlier work. The dependence of hitting times on the type of
unitary ``coin'' is examined, and we give an example of an initial state and
coin which gives an infinite hitting time for a quantum walk. Such infinite
hitting times require destructive interference, and are not observed
classically. Finally, we look at distortions of the hypercube, and observe that
a loss of symmetry in the hypercube increases the hitting time. Symmetry seems
to play an important role in both dramatic speed-ups and slow-downs of quantum

classical computer program. Each computational step is written using reversible
operators, but the operators remain classical in that the qubits take on values
of only zero and one. This classical restriction on the quantum states allows
the copying of qubits, a necessary requirement for doing general classical
computation. Parallel processing of the quantum algorithm proceeds because of
the superpositioning of qubits, the only aspect of the algorithm that is
strictly quantum mechanical. Measurement of the system collapses the
superposition, leaving only one state that can be observed. In most instances,
the loss of information as a result of measurement would be unacceptable. But
the linguistically motivated theory of Analogical Modeling (AM) proposes that
the probabilistic nature of language behavior can be accurately modeled in
terms of the simultaneous analysis of all possible contexts (referred to as
supracontexts) providing one selects a single supracontext from those
supracontexts that are homogeneous in behavior (namely, supracontexts that
allow no increase in uncertainty). The amplitude for each homogeneous
supracontext is proportional to its frequency of occurrence, with the result
that the probability of selecting one particular supracontext to predict the
behavior of the system is proportional to the square of its frequency.

based qubits are considered to be promising candidates for first experimental
tests of quantum hardware. Here we report recent progress in quantum
information processing with point defect in diamond. Qubits are defined as
single spin states (electron or nuclear). This allows exploring long coherence
time (up to seconds for nuclear spins at cryogenic temperatures). In addition,
the optical transition between ground and excited electronic states allows
coupling of spin degrees of freedom to the state of the electromagnetic field.
Such coupling gives access to the spin state readout via spin-selective
scattering of photon. This also allows using of spin state as robust memory for
flying qubits (photons).

response of an $N$-qubit system. We show that in the thermodynamic limit the
irreducible part of the $n$th-order nonlinear susceptibility indicates that the
eigenstates of the system contain entangled $(n+1)$-qubit clusters. This opens
the way to a directly observable multiqubit entanglement signature. We show
that the irreducible part of the static cubic susceptibility of a system of
four flux qubits, as a function of external parameters, behaves as a global
4-qubit entanglement measure introduced in Ref.\cite{Love}.
  We discuss the possibility of extracting purely-entanglement-generated
contribution from the general multipoint correlators in a multiqubit system.

in-principle limitations when the information is quantum. This poses a critical
issue in quantum information theory, for distributed processing and networked
communications. For pure states ideal broadcasting coincides with the so-called
&quot;quantum cloning&quot;, describing an hypothetical ideal device capable of producing
from a finite number N of copies of a state (drawn from a set) a larger number
M&gt;N of output copies of the same state. Since such a transformation is not
isometric, it cannot be achieved by any physical machine for a quantum state
drawn from a non orthogonal set: this is essentially the content of the
&quot;no-cloning&quot; theorem. For mixed states the situation is quite different, since
from the point of view of each single user a local marginal mixed state is
indistinguishable from the partial trace of an entangled state, and there are
infinitely many joint output states that correspond to ideal broadcasting.
Indeed, for sufficiently large number $N$ of input copies, not only ideal
broadcasting of noncommuting mixed states is possible, but one can even purify
the state in the process. Such state purification with an increasing number of
copies has been named &quot;superbroadcasting&quot;. In this paper we will review some
recent results on superbroadcasting of qubits, for two different sets of input
states, corresponding to universally covariant broadcasting and to
phase-covariant broadcasting of equatorial states.

Quantum tomography is formulated in an abstract Hilbert space framework, by
means of the identity decompositions in the Hilbert space of hermitian linear
operators, with trace formula as scalar product of operators. Decompositions of
identity are considered with respect to over-complete families of projectors
labeled by extra parameters and containing a measure, depending on these
parameters. It plays the role of a Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization kernel. When
the measure is equal to one, the decomposition of identity coincides with a
positive operator valued measure (POVM) decomposition. Examples of spin
tomography, photon number tomography and symplectic tomography are reconsidered
in this new framework.

at the Lyapunov exponent of the classical dynamics as the interaction strength
increases. In the saturation regime, the one-particle Wigner function follows
classical dynamics better and better as one goes deeper and deeper in the
semiclassical limit. This demonstrates that quantum-classical correspondence at
the microscopic level requires neither high temperatures, nor coupling to a

an arbitrary number N of identically prepared copies is available. We discuss
the case of states in the whole Bloch sphere as well as the restricted
situation where these states are known to lie on the equatorial plane. For the
former case we obtain that the optimal measurement does not depend on the prior
probability distribution provided it is isotropic. Although the
equatorial-plane case does not have this property for arbitrary N, we give a
prior-independent scheme which becomes optimal in the asymptotic limit of large
N. We compute the maximum mean fidelity in this asymptotic regime for the two
cases. We show that within the pointwise estimation approach these limits can
be obtained in a rather easy and rapid way. This derivation is based on
heuristic arguments that are made rigorous by using van Trees inequalities. The
interrelation between the estimation of the purity and the direction of the
state is also discussed. In the general case we show that they correspond to
independent estimations whereas for the equatorial-plane states this is only
true asymptotically.

electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and ultra-slow light propagation
in atomic Rb-87 vapors. EIT and slow light are achieved by shining a strong,
resonant ``pump'' laser on the atomic medium, which allows slow and
unattenuated propagation of a weaker ``signal'' beam, but only when a
two-photon resonance condition is satisfied. Our wideband architecture is
accomplished by dispersing a wideband signal spatially, transverse to the
propagation direction, prior to entering the atomic cell. When particular
Zeeman sub-levels are used in the EIT system, then one can introduce a magnetic
field with a linear gradient such that the two-photon resonance condition is
satisfied for each individual frequency component. Because slow light is a
group velocity effect, utilizing differential phase shifts across the spectrum
of a light pulse, one must then introduce a slight mismatch from perfect
resonance to induce a delay. We present a model which accounts for diffusion of
the atoms in the varying magnetic field as well as interaction with levels
outside the ideal three-level system on which EIT is based. We find the maximum
delay-bandwidth product decreases with bandwidth, and that delay-bandwidth
product ~1 should be achievable with bandwidth ~50 MHz (~5 ns delay). This is a
large improvement over the ~1 MHz bandwidths in conventional slow light systems
and could be of use in signal processing applications.

increasing the coupling up to a critical value still small enough to allow for
weak-coupling Markovian master equations, a new relaxation regime can occur. In
that regime, complex frequencies lose their real parts such that the process
becomes overdamped. Our results call into question the standard belief that

interference for various examples, including Grover's search algorithm and
Shor's factorization algorithm. We distinguish between ``potentially

However, the amount of interference actually used in Grover's algorithm is only
about 3 i-bits and asymptotically independent of the number of qubits, while
Shor's algorithm indeed uses an exponential amount of interference.

the violation of Bell's inequalities can only be understood if this freedom is
denied. We determine the minimal degree to which the experimenter's freedom has

the experiment. Furthermore, the freedom in choosing experimental arrangements
may be considered as a resource, since its lacking can be used by an
eavesdropper to harm the security of quantum communication. We analyze the
security of quantum key distribution as a function of the (partial) knowledge
the eavesdropper has about the future choices of measurement settings which are
made by the authorized parties (e.g. on the basis of some quasi-random
generator). We show that the equivalence between the violation of Bell's

case of complete freedom (no setting knowledge) - is lost unless one adapts the

otherwise exact theory which expresses the reduced density matrix of an
arbitrary subsystem, interacting linearly with an uncoupled harmonic oscillator
bath, as an average of diadics formed from state vectors which obey stochastic
variational-differential equations. The vacuum radiation field can be
represented as such an oscillator bath, and so this model is in widespread use
in quantum optics. Prior to the development of NMQSD, exact subsystem solutions
could only be obtained in a few special cases (e.g. spin-1/2, harmonic
oscillator). Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to obtain exact
solutions to new problems using NMQSD due to the difficulty of solving the
variational-differential equations. Here we show that these equations can be
transformed into a pair of coupled nonlinear integrodifferential equations. We
develop exact numerical methods for the integrodifferential equations and show
that solutions can be readily obtained to good accuracy for quite general

fluorescence from a two-level atom in a band gap, and intermittent fluorescence
from a driven three level system representing electronic states of singly

cycle graph $C_n$, complete graph $K_n$, graph $G_n$, finite path and some
other finite and infinite graphs, where all are connected with orthogonal

the infinite time asymptotic behavior of amplitudes simply by using the method
of stationary phase approximation(WKB approximation), where as an example, the
method is applied to star, two-dimensional comb lattices, infinite Hermite and
Laguerre graphs. Also by using the Gauss quadrature formula one can approximate
infinite graphs with finite ones and vice versa, in order to derive large time
asymptotic behavior by WKB method. Likewise, using this method, some new graphs
are introduced, where their amplitude are proportional to product of amplitudes
of some elementary graphs, even though the graphs themselves are not the same

that continuous time quantum walk at different infinite graphs belong to

Einstein's contributed mainly to the foundations of Quantum Mechanics. We

wish to delete one copy from among the given two copies. The quantum
no-deletion principle restricts us from perfectly deleting a copy but it does
not prohibit us from deleting a copy approximately. Here we construct two types
of a universal quantum deletion machine which approximately deletes a copy such
that the fidelity of deletion does not depend on the input state. The two types
of universal quantum deletion machines are (1) a conventional deletion machine
described by one unitary operator and (2) a modified deletion machine described
by two unitary operators. Here it is shown that modified deletion machine
deletes a qubit with fidelity 0.75, which is the maximum limit for deleting an
unknown quantum state. In addition to this we also show that the modified
deletion machine retains the qubit in the first mode with average fidelity 0.77
(approx.) which is slightly greater than the fidelity of measurement for two
given identical state, showing how precisely one can determine its state [13].
We also show that the deletion machine itself is input state independent i.e.
the information is not hidden in the deleting machine, and hence we can delete
the information completely from the deletion machine.

are based on the first-order correction ${\bra{\Psi_{\rm ground}(t)}\dot
H(t)\ket{\Psi_{\rm excited}(t)} /\Delta E^2(t)\ll1}$. However, it is
demonstrated that this first-order correction does not yield a good estimate
for the computational error. Therefore, a more general criterion is proposed,
which includes higher-order corrections as well and shows that the
computational error can be made exponentially small -- which facilitates
significantly shorter evolution times than the above first-order estimate in
certain situations. Based on this criterion and rather general arguments and
assumptions, it can be demonstrated that a run-time $T$ of order of the inverse
minimum energy gap $\Delta E_{\rm min}$ is sufficient and necessary, i.e.,
$T=\ord(\Delta E_{\rm min}^{-1})$. For some examples, these analytical
investigations are confirmed by numerical simulations. PACS: 03.67.Lx,

local operators and classical communication (LOCC) satisfy the condition that
the sum of Schmidit numbers of the orthogonal states is not bigger than the
dimensions of the whole space. A natural question is whether an arbitary
ensembles of LOCC-distinguishable orthogonal states satisfies the condition. We
first show that, in this paper, the answer is positive. Then we generalize it
into multipartite systems, and show that a necessary condition for
LOCC-distinguishability of multipartite orthogonal quantum states is that the
sum of the least numbers of the product states (For bipartite system, the least
number of product states is Schmidit number) of the orthogonal states is not
bigger than the dimensions of the Hilbert space of the multipartite system.
This necessary condition is very simple and general, and one can get many cases
of indistinguishability by it. It means that the least number of the product
states acts an important role in distinguishablity of states, and implies that
the least number of the product states may be an good manifestion of quantum
nonlocality in some sense. In fact, entanglement emphases the &quot;amount&quot; of
nonlocality, but the least number of the product states emphases the types of
nonlocality. For example, the known W states and GHZ states have different
least number of the product states, and are different in type.

incompleteness of quantum mechanics (QM) was opposed by most EPR's contemporary
physicists and is not accepted within the standard interpretation of QM, which
maintains that QM is a complete theory. An analysis of the semantic
implications of the opponent positions shows that they imply different notions
of truth. The introduction of a nonclassical notion of truth within the
standard interpretation is usually justified by referring to known theorems
that should prove that QM is a contextual and nonlocal theory. However, these
theorems are based on a doubtful implicit epistemological assumption. If one
renounces it, one can provide an alternative interpretation of QM that it
realistic in a semantic sense. Within this interpretation the EPR viewpoint is
recovered and QM is considered a (semantically) incomplete, noncontextual and
local theory. Furthermore, the new interpretation provides several suggestions
for constructing a more general theory embedding QM and for connecting QM with
classical physics and relativity.

  Light</title><description>  We present the design and experimental proof of principle of a low threshold
optical parametric oscillator (OPO) that continuously oscillates over a large
bandwidth allowed by phase matching. The large oscillation bandwidth is
achieved with a selective two-photon loss that suppresses the inherent mode
competition, which tends to narrow the bandwidth in conventional OPOs. Our
design performs pairwise mode-locking of many frequency pairs, in direct
equivalence to passive mode-locking of ultrashort pulsed lasers. The ability to
obtain high powers of continuous \textit{and} broadband down-converted light
enables the optimal exploitation of the correlations within the down-converted
spectrum, thereby strongly affecting two-photon interactions even at
classically high power levels, and opening new venues for applications such as
two-photon spectroscopy and microscopy and optical spread spectrum
communication.

  three-dimensional rectangular cavities</title><description>  The Casimir force due to {\it thermal} fluctuations (or pseudo-Casimir force)
was previously calculated for the perfect Bose gas in the slab geometry for
various boundary conditions. The Casimir pressure due to {\it quantum}
fluctuations in a weakly-interacting dilute Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
confined to a parallel plate geometry was recently calculated for Dirichlet
boundary conditions. In this paper we calculate the Casimir energy and pressure
due to quantum fluctuations in a zero-temperature homogeneous
weakly-interacting dilute BEC confined to a parallel plate geometry with
periodic boundary conditions and include higher-order corrections which we
refer to as Bogoliubov corrections. The leading order term is identified as the
Casimir energy of a massless scalar field moving with wave velocity equal to
the speed of sound in the BEC. We then obtain the leading order Casimir
pressure in a general three-dimensional rectangular cavity of arbitrary lengths
and obtain the finite-size correction to the parallel plate scenario.

restricted sets [An Min Wang: PRA, \textbf{74}, 032317(2006)] using GHZ states.
We detailedly describe the protocols in the cases of one qubit, respectively,
with one controller and with two senders. Then we extend the protocols to the
cases of multiqubits with many controllers and two senders. Because our
protocols have to demand the controller(s)'s startup and authorization or two
senders together working and cooperations, the controlled and combined remote
implementations of quantum operations definitely can enhance the security of
remote quantum information processing and potentially have more applications.
Moreover, our protocol with two senders is helpful to farthest arrive at the
power of remote implementations of quantum operations in theory since the
different senders perhaps have different operational resources and different
operational rights in practice.

The source emits light colinearly at the non-degenerate wavelengths of 810 nm

long-distance quantum communication. The configuration favors long crystals,
which promote a high photon-pair production rate at a narrow bandwidth,
together with a high pair-probability in fibers. The quality of entanglement is
limited by chromatic dispersion, which we analyze by determining the output
state. We find that such a decoherence effect is strongly material dependent,
providing for long crystals an upper bound on the visibility of the coincidence
fringes of 41% for KTiOPO4, and zero for LiNbO3. The best obtained raw

laser couples the intermediate state $A^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}(v=13, J=14)$ to the
upper state $G^{1}\Pi_{g}(v=11, J=14)$ of $^7Li_2$, the fluorescence from both
$A^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}$ and $G^{1}\Pi_{g}$ states was drastically reduced as the
weak probe laser was tuned through the resonance transition between the ground
state $X^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{g}(v=4, J=15)$ and the excited state
$A^{1}\Sigma^{+}_{u}(v=13, J=14)$. The strong coupling laser makes an optically
thick medium transparent for the probe transition. In addition, The fact that
fluorescence from the upper state $G^{1}\Pi_{g}(v=11, J=14)$ was also dark when
both lasers were tuned at resonance implies that the molecules were trapped in
the ground state. We used density matrix methods to simulate the response of an
open molecular three-level system to the action of a strong coupling field and
a weak probe field. The analytical solutions were obtained under the
steady-state condition. We have incorporated the magnetic sublevel (M)

Retrodictive states, which are associated with a measurement event and
propagate backwards in time, are also useful, however. In this paper we show
how any retrodictive state of light that can be written to a good approximation
as a finite superposition of photon number states can be generated by an

controlling predictive coherent input states. We show how the probability of

bose-fermi and bose-bose particles. Such a system can be realized in current
experiments with ultracold bose-fermi mixtures.We apply the Bethe-ansatz
technique to find the exact ground state energy at zero temperature for any
value of interaction strength and density ratio between bosons and fermions. We
use it to prove the absence of the demixing, contrary to prediction of a mean
field approximation. Combining exact solution with local density approximation
(LDA) in a harmonic trap, we calculate the density profiles and frequencies of
collective modes in various limits. In the strongly interacting regime, we
predict the appearance of low-lying collective oscillations which correspond to
the counterflow of the two species. In the strongly interacting regime we use
exact wavefunction to calculate the single particle correlation functions for
bosons and fermions at low temperatures under periodic boundary conditions. We
derive an analytical formula, which allows to calculate correlation functions
at all distances numerically for a polynomial time in the system size. We
investigate numerically two strong singularities of the momentum distribution
for fermions at $k_f$ and $k_f+2k_b.$ We show, that in strongly interacting
regime correlation functions change dramatically as temperature changes from 0
to a small temperature $\sim E_f/\gamma.$ A strong change of the momentum
distribution in a small range of temperatures can be used to perform a
thermometry at very small temperatures.

  momentum</title><description>  The question how to quantize a classical system where an angle phi is one of
the basic canonical variables has been controversial since the early days of
quantum mechanics. The problem is that the angle is a multivalued or
discontinuous variable on the corresponding phase space. The remedy is to
replace phi by the smooth periodic functions cos phi and sin phi. In the case
of the canonical pair (phi,l),l: orbital angular momentum (OAM), the phase
space S_(phi,l) ={phi in R mod 2pi, l in R} has the global structure S^1 x R of
a cylinder on which the Poisson brackets of the 3 functions cos phi, sin phi
and l obey the Lie algebra of the euclidean group E(2) in the plane. This
property provides the basis for the quantization of the system in terms of
irreducible unitary representations of the group E(2) or of its covering
groups. A crucial point is that - due to the fact that the subgroup SO(2) = S^1
is multiply connected - these representations allow for fractional OAM l = n +
c, c in [0,1). Such c not 0 have already been observed in cases like the
Aharonov-Bohm and the fractional quantum Hall effects and they correspond to
the quasi-momenta of Bloch waves in ideal crystals. The proposal of the present
paper is to look for fractional OAM in connection with the quantum optics of
Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes in external magnetic fields. The quantum theory
of the phase space S_(phi,l) in terms of unitary representations of E(2) allows

has undergone a linear lossy channel. The scheme constitutes only a single beam
splitter and a homodyne detector, and thus is experimentally feasible. In
practice, a superposition of coherent states is transformed into a classical
mixture of coherent states by linear loss, which is usually the dominant
decoherence mechanism in optical systems. We also address the possibility of
producing a larger amplitude superposition state from decohered states, and

The quantum analogue of the replicator dynamics is the equation of evolution of
mixed states from quantum statistical mechanics. A system and all its members
will cooperate and rearrange its states to improve their present condition.
They strive to reach the best possible state for each of them which is also the
best possible state for the whole system. This led us to propose a quantum
equilibrium in which a system is stable only if it maximizes the welfare of the
collective above the welfare of the individual. If it is maximized the welfare
of the individual above the welfare of the collective the system gets unstable

Our method is a generalization of one introduced by Myers and is based on the

either state \alpha_0 or state \alpha_1, we are required to output `0', `1' or
`?' (&quot;don't know&quot;), such that conditioned on outputting `0' or `1', our guess
is correct with high probability. The goal is to maximize the probability of
not outputting `?'. We prove a direct product theorem: if we're given two such
problems, with optimal probabilities a and b, respectively, and the states in
the first problem are pure, then the optimal probability for the joint
bounded-error state identification problem is O(ab). Our proof is based on
semidefinite programming duality and may be of wider interest.
  Using this result, we present two exponential separations in the simultaneous
message passing model of communication complexity. Both are shown in the
strongest possible sense. First, we describe a relation that can be computed
with O(log n) classical bits of communication in the presence of shared
randomness, but needs Omega(n^{1/3}) communication if the parties don't share
randomness, even if communication is quantum. This shows the optimality of
Yao's recent exponential simulation of shared-randomness protocols by quantum
protocols without shared randomness. Second, we describe a relation that can be
computed with O(log n) classical bits of communication in the presence of
shared entanglement, but needs Omega((n/log n)^{1/3}) communication if the
parties share randomness but no entanglement, even if communication is quantum.
This is the first example in communication complexity of a situation where
entanglement buys you much more than quantum communication does.

  quantum memories</title><description>  An elementary quantum network operation involves storing a qubit state in an
atomic quantum memory node, and then retrieving and transporting the
information through a single photon excitation to a remote quantum memory node
for further storage or analysis. Implementations of quantum network operations
are thus conditioned on the ability to realize such matter-to-light and/or
light-to-matter quantum state mappings. Here, we report generation,
transmission, storage and retrieval of single quanta using two remote atomic
ensembles. A single photon is generated from a cold atomic ensemble at Site A
via the protocol of Duan, Lukin, Cirac, and Zoller (DLCZ) [Nature v.414, 413
(2001)] and is directed to Site B through a 100 meter long optical fiber. The
photon is converted into a single collective excitation via the dark-state
polariton approach of Fleischhauer and Lukin [Phys. Rev. Lett. v.84, 5094
(2000)]. After a programmable storage time the atomic excitation is converted
back into a single photon. This is demonstrated experimentally, for a storage
time of 500 nanoseconds, by measurement of an anticorrelation parameter a.
Storage times exceeding ten microseconds are observed by intensity
cross-correlation measurements. The length of the storage period is two orders
of magnitude longer than the time to achieve conversion between photonic and
atomic quanta. The controlled transfer of single quanta between remote quantum
memories constitutes an important step towards distributed quantum networks.

movement of ions through intersections. We further propose an additional DC

computation is performed when a unitary evolution operator, acting as a quantum
logic gate, transforms the state of qudits in a quantum system. Unitary
operators can be represented by square unitary matrices. If the system consists
of a single qudit, then Tilma et al (J.Phys. A: Math. Gen. 35 (2002)

quantum system consists of multiple qudits, then a gate may be synthesized by
matrix decomposition techniques such as QR factorization and the Cosine-sine
Decomposition (CSD). In this article, we present a CSD based synthesis method
for n qudit hybrid quantum gates, and as a consequence, derive a CSD based
synthesis method for n qudit gates where all the qudits have the same

the sub-processes, cannot be experimentally measured and, consequently, have no
physical meaning; on the contrary, quantities introduced for either sub-process
have no basis, for the time evolution of either sub-process is unknown in this
model. We show that the wave function to describe a completed scattering can be
uniquely presented as the sum of two solutions to the Schr\&quot;odinger equation,
which describe separately the sub-processes at all stages of scattering. For
symmetric potential barriers such solutions are found explicitly. For either
sub-process we define the time spent, on the average, by a particle in the
barrier region. We define it as the Larmor time. As it turned out, this time is
just Buttiker's dwell time averaged over the corresponding localized state.
Thus, firstly, we justify the known definition of the local dwell time
introduced by Hauge and co-workers as well by Leavens and Aers, for now this
time can be measured; secondly, we confirm that namely Buttiker's dwell time
gives the energy-distribution for the tunneling time; thirdly, we state that
all the definitions are valid only if they are based on the wave functions for
transmission and reflection found in our paper. Besides, we define the exact
and asymptotic group times to be auxiliary in timing the scattering process.

problems not generally regarded as searching problems, can be reformulated to
take advantage of quantum parallelism and entanglement, and lead to algorithms
which show a square root speedup over their classical counterparts.
  In this paper, we discuss a systematic way to formulate such problems and
give as an example a quantum scheduling algorithm for an $R||C_{max}$ problem.
$R||C_{max}$ is representative for a class of scheduling problems whose goal is
to find a schedule with the shortest completion time in an unrelated parallel
machine environment.
  Given a deadline, or a range of deadlines, the algorithm presented in this
paper allows us to determine if a solution to an $R||C_{max}$ problem with $N$
jobs and $M$ machines exists, and if so, it provides the schedule. The time
complexity of the quantum scheduling algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{M^N})$
while the complexity of its classical counterpart is $\mathcal{O}(M^N)$.

the timing of the incoming pulse. When the eavesdropper sends short pulses
using the appropriate timing so that the two gated detectors in Bob's setup

Employing the tools of quantum optics we treat in terms of two-qubit MES some

the admissible control that minimizes a given cost function is a memoryless

P is the physical probability measure associated with the dynamics of the

state reduction occurs asymptotically--that is to say, over an infinite time
horizon. In the case of a time-dependent coupling, we show that if the
magnitude of the coupling decreases sufficiently rapidly, then the energy
variance will be reduced under the dynamics, but the state need not reach an
energy eigenstate. This situation corresponds to the case of a ``partial'' or
``incomplete'' measurement of the energy. We also construct an example of a

measurements of spin or polarization on multi-particle systems in singlet
states. These observables are all non-commuting and satisfy an uncertainty
relation. Theoretically, the non-commuting nature should be independent of
whether the singlet state consists of multiple particles or a single particle.
Recent experiments in single neutron interferometry have in fact demonstrated
this. In addition, if Bell-type inequalities can be found for experiments
involving spin and polarization, the same should be true for experiments
involving other non-commuting observables such as position and momentum as in
the original EPR paper. As such, an experiment is proposed to measure (quantum
mechanically) position and momentum for a single oscillator as a means for
deriving a Bell-type inequality for these correlated observables. The
experiment, if realizable, would shed light on the basic nature of matter,
perhaps pointing to some form of self-entanglement, and would also help to
further elucidate a possible mechanism behind the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle. Violation of these inequalities would, in fact, offer yet another
confirmation of the principle.

space) when they are immersed in a background of non-interacting fermionic
matter fields. The interaction follows from the obstructions to the (quantum
mechanical) motions of the fermions caused by the presence of bubbles or other
(heavy) particles in the Fermi sea, as, for example, nuclei in the neutron sea
in the inner crust of a neutron star or superfluid grains in a normal Fermi
liquid. The effect resembles the traditional Casimir interaction between
metallic mirrors in the vacuum. However, the fluctuating electromagnetic fields
are replaced by fermionic matter fields. We show that the fermionic Casimir
problem for a system of spherical cavities can be solved exactly, since the
calculation can be mapped onto a quantum mechanical billiard problem of a
point-particle scattered off a finite number of non-overlapping spheres or
disks. Finally we generalize the map method to other Casimir systems,
especially to the case of a fluctuating scalar field between two spheres or a
sphere and a plate under Dirichlet boundary conditions.

momentum. Since the spin and momentum generally are entangled, the maps
generally are not completely positive and act in limited domains. States with
two momentum values are considered, so the maps are for the spin qubit
entangled with the qubit made from the two momentum values, and results from
the open quantum dynamics of two coupled qubits can be applied. Inverse maps
are used to show that every Lorentz transformation completely removes the spin
polarization, and so completely removes the information, from a number of spin
density matrices. The size of the spin polarization that is removed is
calculated for particular cases.

quantum fluctuations latent in the quantum momentum are suppressed. This is
done by adding generic local deformations to the quantum momentum operator
which give rise to a deformed kinetic term quantifying the amount of
``fuzzyness'' caused by such fluctuations. Considered as a functional of such
deformations, the deformed kinetic term is shown to possess a unique minimum
which is seen to be the classical kinetic energy. Furthermore, we show that
extremization of the associated deformed action functional introduces an
essential nonlinearity to the resulting field equations which are seen to be
the classical Hamilton-Jacobi and continuity equations. Thus, a variational
procedure determines the particular deformation that has the effect of
suppressing the quantum fluctuations, resulting in dequantization of the

statistical model on the phase space $\Omega= H\times H,$ where $H$ is the real
Hilbert space. Statistical states are given by Gaussian measures on $\Omega$
having zero mean value and dispersion of very small magnitude $\alpha$ (which
is considered as a small parameter of the model). Such statistical states can
be interpreted as fluctuations of the background field, cf. with SED and
Nelson's mechanics. Physical variables (e.g., energy) are given by maps $f:
\Omega \to {\bf R}$ (functions of classical fields). The conventional quantum
representation of our prequantum classical statistical model is constructed on
the basis of the Taylor expansion (up to the terms of the second order at the
vacuum field point $\psi\_{\rm{vacuum}}\equiv 0)$ of variables $f: \Omega \to
{\bf R}$ with respect to the small parameter $\sqrt{\alpha}.$ The complex
structure of QM is induced by the symplectic structure on the
infinite-dimensional phase space $\Omega.$ A Gaussian measure (statistical
state) is represented in QM by its covariation operator. Equations of
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger, Heisenberg and von Neumann are images of Hamiltonian dynamics
on $\Omega.$ The main experimental prediction of our prequantum model is that
experimental statistical averages can deviate from ones given by QM.

communication is needed for party A to send her share to party B. Recently, it
was found that the number of qubits which should be sent is given by the
conditional entropy. This quantifies the notion of partial information, and it
can even be negative. Here, we not only demand that A send her state to B, but
additionally, B should send his state to A. Paradoxically, we find that
requiring that the parties perform this additional task can lower the amount of
quantum communication required. This primitive, which we call quantum state
exchange, can be used to quantify the notion of uncommon information, since the
two parties only need to send each other the parts of their state they don't
hold in common. In the classical case, the concept of uncommon information
follows trivially from the concept of partial information. We find that for
quantum states, this is not so. We prove upper and lower bounds for the
uncommon information and find optimal protocols for several classes of states.

yields over a very wide range of beam energies, reaching from 1 A GeV up to 200
A GeV, using only one or two parameters. A systematic comparison of these
proposals is presented here. The conditions of fixed energy per particle,
baryon+anti-baryon density, normalized entropy density as well as percolation
model are investigated. The results are compared with the most recent chemical
freeze-out parameters obtained in the thermal-statistical analysis of particle
yields. The sensitivity and dependence of the results on parameters is analyzed
and discussed. It is shown that in the energy range above the top AGS energy,
within present accuracies, all chemical freeze-out criteria give a fairly good
description of the particle yields. However, the low energy heavy-ion data
favor the constant energy per particle as a unified condition of chemical
particle freeze-out. This condition also shows the weakest sensitivity on model
assumptions and parameters.

We concentrate on the situation where the control and probe beams are

the link between optimal cloning and light amplification via stimulated

structures such as networks and rings having potential barriers in their arms.
We find the generic presence of Hartman effect, with superluminal velocities as
a consequence, in these systems. In quantum networks it is possible to control
the `super arrival' time in one of the arms by changing the parameters on
another arm which is spatially separated from it. This is yet another quantum
nonlocal effect. Negative time delays (time advancement) and `ultra Hartman
effect' with negative saturation times have been observed in some parameter
regimes. In presence and absence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) flux quantum rings show
Hartman effect. We obtain the analytical expression for the saturated phase
time. In the opaque barrier regime this is independent of even the AB flux
thereby generalizing the Hartman effect. We also briefly discuss the concept of
&quot;space collapse or space destroyer&quot; by introducing a free space in between two
barriers covering the ring. Further we show in presence of absorption the
reflection phase time exhibits Hartman effect in contrast to the transmission
phase time.

time-energy uncertainty relations from the domain of unitary Hamiltonian
dynamics to that of dissipative dynamics as described by a broad class of
linear and nonlinear evolution equations for the density operator. For
non-dissipative dynamics, by using the Schroedinger inequality instead of the
Heisenberg-Robertson inequality, we obtain a general exact time-energy
uncertainty relation which is sharper than the usual Mandelstam-Tamm-Messiah
relation $\tau_F\Delta_H\ge \hbar/2$. For simultaneous unitary/dissipative
dynamics, the usual time-energy uncertainty relation is replaced by a less
restrictive relation that depends on the characteristic time of dissipation,
$\tau$, and the uncertainty associated with the generalized nonequilibrium
Massieu-function operator which defines the structure of the dissipative part
of the assumed class of evolution equations. Within the steepest-entropy-ascent
dissipative quantum dynamics of an isolated system introduced earlier by this

relation $(2\tau_F\Delta_H/ \hbar)^2+ (\tau_F\Delta_S/k_B\tau)^2 \ge 1$. We

topology. Among its many connections to various mathematical and physical
areas, it is known (due to Witten) to be intimately connected to Topological
Quantum Field Theory (TQFT). The works of Freedman, Kitaev, Larsen and Wang
provide an efficient simulation of TQFT by a quantum computer, and vice versa.
These results implicitly imply the existence of an efficient quantum algorithm
that provides a certain additive approximation of the Jones polynomial at the
fifth root of unity, e^{2\pi i/5}, and moreover, that this problem is
BQP-complete. Unfortunately, this important algorithm was never explicitly
formulated. Moreover, the results mentioned are heavily based on TQFT, which
makes the algorithm essentially inaccessible to computer scientists.
  We provide an explicit and simple polynomial quantum algorithm to approximate
the Jones polynomial of an n-strands braid with m crossings at any primitive
root of unity e^{2\pi i/k}, where the running time of the algorithm is
polynomial in m,n and k. Our algorithm is based, rather than on TQFT, on well
known mathematical results. By the results of Freedman et. al., our algorithm
solves a BQP complete problem.
  The algorithm we provide exhibits a structure which we hope is generalizable
to other quantum algorithmic problems. Candidates of particular interest are
the approximations of other #P-hard problems, most notably, the partition
function of the Potts model, a model which is known to be tightly connected to
the Jones polynomial.

spin-density-wave, and phase-separation, which can be sketched out by the local
entanglement, singlet superconductivity phase could be identified on the
contour map of the block-block entanglement. Scaling analysis shows that ${\rm

non-critical and the critical regions, while some local extremum are induced by
the finite-size effect. We also study the block-block entanglement defined in

between a two-level atom with photon recoil and a quantized field mode in an
ideal cavity, the basic model of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). It is
shown that the Jaynes-Cummings dynamics can be unstable in the regime of
chaotic walking of the atomic center-of-mass in the quantized field of a
standing wave in the absence of any kind of interaction with environment. This
kind of quantum instability manifests itself in strong variations of reduced
quantum purity and entropy, correlating with the respective classical Lyapunov
exponent, and in exponential sensitivity of fidelity of quantum states to small
variations in the atom-field detuning. The connection between quantum
entanglement and fidelity and the center-of-mass motion is clarified
analytically and numerically for a few regimes of that motion. The results are
illustrated with two specific initial field states: the Fock and coherent ones.
Numerical experiments demonstrate various manifestations of the
quantum-classical correspondence, including dynamical chaos and fractals, which
can be, in principle, observed in real experiments with atoms and photons in
high finesse cavities.

is limited by the read-out channel, or in a high Q cavity, it is nearly

CV field. We show that, considering realistic conditions in the generation of
CV entanglement, a small number of qubits resonantly coupled to the CV system
is sufficient for an almost complete dynamical transfer of the entanglement.
Our analysis also sheds further light on the transition between microscopic and
macroscopic behaviours of composite finite dimensional systems coupled to
bosonic fields (like atomic clouds interacting with light). Furthermore, we
present a protocol based on sequential interactions of the CV system with some
ancillary qubit systems and on subsequent measurements, allowing to
probabilistically convert CV entanglement into `almost perfect' Bell pairs of
two qubits. Our proposals are suited for realizations in various experimental
settings, ranging from cavity-QED to cavity-integrated superconducting devices.

known that this entropy satisfies the area law -- entropy proportional to the
area of the sphere -- when the field is assumed to be in its ground state. We
show that the area law continues to hold when the scalar field degrees of
freedom are in generic coherent states and a class of squeezed states. However,
when excited states are considered, the entropy scales as a lower power of the
area. This suggests that for large horizons, the ground state entropy
dominates, whereas entropy due to excited states gives power law corrections.

analyzing random decoupling schemes, applicable to quantum dynamical control of
arbitrary finite-dimensional composite systems. The basic idea is to design the
control propagator according to a random rather than deterministic path on a
group. We characterize the performance of random decoupling protocols, and
identify control scenarios where they can significantly weaken time scale
requirements as compared to cyclic counterparts. Implications for reliable
quantum computation are discussed.

  schemes</title><description>  We revisit the problem of switching off unwanted phase evolution and
decoherence in a single two-state quantum system in the light of recent results
on random dynamical decoupling methods [L. Viola and E. Knill, Phys. Rev. Lett.
{\bf 94}, 060502 (2005)]. A systematic comparison with standard cyclic
decoupling is effected for a variety of dynamical regimes, including the case
of both semiclassical and fully quantum decoherence models. In particular,
exact analytical expressions are derived for randomized control of decoherence
from a bosonic environment. We investigate quantitatively control protocols
based on purely deterministic, purely random, as well as hybrid design, and
identify their relative merits and weaknesses at improving system performance.
We find that for time-independent systems, hybrid protocols tend to perform
better than pure random and may improve over standard asymmetric schemes,
whereas random protocols can be considerably more stable against fluctuations
in the system parameters. Beside shedding light on the physical requirements
underlying randomized control, our analysis further demonstrates the potential
for explicit control settings where the latter may significantly improve over
conventional schemes.

  Finitely Generated Uniform Quantum Circuit Families</title><description>  In order to establish the computational equivalence between quantum Turing
machines (QTMs) and quantum circuit families (QCFs) using Yao's quantum circuit
simulation of QTMs, we previously introduced the class of uniform QCFs based on
an infinite set of elementary gates, which has been shown to be computationally
equivalent to the polynomial-time QTMs (with appropriate restriction of
amplitudes) up to bounded error simulation. This result implies that the
complexity class BQP introduced by Bernstein and Vazirani for QTMs equals its
counterpart for uniform QCFs. However, the complexity classes ZQP and EQP for
QTMs do not appear to equal their counterparts for uniform QCFs. In this paper,
we introduce a subclass of uniform QCFs, the finitely generated uniform QCFs,
based on finite number of elementary gates and show that the class of finitely
generated uniform QCFs is perfectly equivalent to the class of polynomial-time
QTMs; they can exactly simulate each other. This naturally implies that BQP as
well as ZQP and EQP equal the corresponding complexity classes of the finitely
generated uniform QCFs.

as an example of the geometric phase. Though there is some superficial
similarity between these two notions, we here show that the differences bewteen
these two notions are more profound and fundamental. As an explicit example, we
analyze in detail a quantum mechanical model proposed by M. Stone, which is
supposed to show the above connection. We show that the geometric term in the
model, which is topologically trivial for any finite time interval $T$,
corresponds to the so-called ``normal naive term'' in field theory and has
nothing to do with the anomaly-induced Wess-Zumino term. In the fundamental
level, the difference between the two notions is stated as follows: The
topology of gauge fields leads to level crossing in the fermionic sector in the
case of chiral anomaly and the {\em failure} of the adiabatic approximation is
essential in the analysis, whereas the (potential) level crossing in the matter
sector leads to the topology of the Berry phase only when the precise adiabatic
approximation holds.

even within a unitary Hamiltonian description. This general scenario is
illustrated here by focusing on a quantum dot coupled to a chaotic cavity
containing a finite, but large, number of states using a Hamiltonian
formulation. For weak coupling to a chaotic cavity with a sufficiently dense
spectrum, the ensuing complex structure of resonances and antiresonances leads
to phase randomization under coarse graining in energy. Such phase
instabilities and coarse graining are the ingredients for a mechanism producing
decoherence and thus irreversibility. For the present simple model one finds a
conductance that coincides with the one obtained by adding a ficticious voltage
probe within the Landauer-Buettiker picture. This sheds new light on how the
microscopic mechanisms that produce phase fluctuations induce decoherence.

quantum fluctuations follow from a physical noise mechanism. The stability of
the hydrogen ground state can then arise from a balance between Lorentz damping
and energy absorption from the noise. Since the damping is weak, the ground

  A candidate for this phase space density is constructed for ground state of
the relativistic hydrogen problem of a spinless particle. The first excited

analytic expression of the ground state energy can be reproduced, provided
averages of certain products are replaced by products of averages. This

degree of entanglement of multipartite quantum systems [Phys. Rev. A 64, 022306
(2001)]. Although generally intractable, it turns out that there is a bound on
the Schmidt measure for two-colorable graph states [Phys. Rev. A 69, 062311
(2004)]. For these states, the Schmidt measure is in fact directly related to
the number of nonzero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the associated
graph. We remark that almost all two-colorable graph states have maximal
Schmidt measure and we construct specific examples. These involve perfect
trees, line graphs of trees, cographs, graphs from anti-Hadamard matrices, and
unyciclic graphs. We consider some graph transformations, with the idea of
transforming a two-colorable graph state with maximal Schmidt measure into
another one with the same property. In particular, we consider a transformation
introduced by Francois Jaeger, line graphs, and switching. By making appeal to
a result of Ehrenfeucht et al. [Discrete Math. 278 (2004)], we point out that
local complementation and switching form a transitive group acting on the set
of all graph states of a given dimension.

subgroup problem (HSP). What is more, most exponential speedups in quantum
computation are obtained by solving instances of the HSP. A common feature of
the resulting algorithms is the use of quantum coset states, which encode the
hidden subgroup. An open question has been how hard it is to use these states
to solve graph isomorphism. It was recently shown by Moore, Russell, and
Schulman that only an exponentially small amount of information is available
from one, or a pair of coset states. A potential source of power to exploit are
entangled quantum measurements that act jointly on many states at once. We show
that entangled quantum measurements on at least \Omega(n log n) coset states
are necessary to get useful information for the case of graph isomorphism,
matching an information theoretic upper bound. This may be viewed as a negative
result because highly entangled measurements seem hard to implement in general.
Our main theorem is very general and also rules out using joint measurements on
few coset states for some other groups, such as GL(n, F_{p^m}) and G^n where G
is finite and satisfies a suitable property.

  Computing</title><description>  Algorithmic Cooling is a method that uses novel data compression techniques
and simplecquantum computing devices to improve NMR spectroscopy, and to offer
scalable NMR quantum computers. The algorithm recursively employs two steps. A
reversible entropy compression of the computation quantum-bits (qubits) of the
system and an irreversible heat transfer from the system to the environment
through a set of reset qubits that reach thermal relaxation rapidly.
  Is it possible to experimentally demonstrate algorithmic cooling using
existing technology? To allow experimental algorithmic cooling, the
thermalization time of the reset qubits must be much shorter than the
thermalization time of the computation qubits. However such
thermalization-times ratios have yet to be reported.
  We investigate here the effect of a paramagnetic salt on the
thermalization-times ratio of computation qubits (carbons) and a reset qubit
(hydrogen). We show that the thermalization-times ratio is improved by
approximately three-fold. Based on this result, an experimental demonstration
of algorithmic cooling by thermalization and magnetic ions is currently

state was recently suggested by Cohen, and by Gour and Meyer. In that protocol,
Bob can sample from a probability distribution P that is given to Alice, even
if Alice has absolutely no knowledge about P. Pursuing a similar line of
thought, we suggest here a limited form of nonlocality - &quot;classical
nonlocality&quot;. Our nonlocality is the (somewhat limited) classical analogue of
the Hughston-Jozsa-Wootters (HJW) quantum nonlocality. The HJW nonlocality
tells us how, for a given density matrix rho, Alice can generate any
rho-ensemble on the North Star. This is done using surprisingly few resources -
one shared entangled state (prepared in advance), one generalized quantum
measurement, and no communication. Similarly, our classical nonlocality
presents how, for a given probability distribution P, Alice can generate any
P-ensemble on the North Star, using only one correlated state (prepared in
advance), one (generalized) classical measurement, and no communication.
  It is important to clarify that while the classical teleportation and the
classical non-locality protocols are probably rather insignificant from a
classical information processing point of view, they significantly contribute
to our understanding of what exactly is quantum in their well established and
highly famous quantum analogues.

scalable. It is centered on the idea of a quantum bus based on semiconductor
self-assembled quantum dots. This allows for transmission of qubits between the
different quantum registers, and could be integrated in most of the present
proposal for semiconductor quantum dot-based quantum computation. Our proposal
exploits the peculiar properties of {\it relatively short} spin-chains, and
advantages and disadvantages of two possible implementations, both based on
spin-chain global dynamics, are discussed in details. A clear advantage of the
scheme is to avoid the use of microcavities for long distance communication
between different elements of the quantum computer. In this respect our scheme
is comparatively faster than hybrid quantum dot-microcavity schemes.

the NOON state projection measurement to a four-photon superposition state from
two perpendicularly oriented type-I parametric down-conversion processes. A

offers a multi-step pathway between the microscopic functions of neurons and
the macroscopic functions of brain systems revealed by hemodynamic imaging. We
use electroencephalographic (EEG) records collected from high-density electrode
arrays fixed on the epidural surfaces of primary sensory and limbic areas in
rabbits and cats trained to discriminate conditioned stimuli (CS) in the
various modalities. High temporal resolution of EEG signals with the Hilbert
transform gives evidence for diverse intermittent spatial patterns of amplitude
(AM) and phase modulations (PM) of carrier waves that repeatedly re-synchronize
in the beta and gamma ranges at near zero time lags over long distances. The
dominant mechanism for neural interactions by axodendritic synaptic
transmission should impose distance-dependent delays on the EEG oscillations
owing to finite propagation velocities. It does not. EEGs instead show evidence
for anomalous dispersion: the existence in neural populations of a low velocity
range of information and energy transfers, and a high velocity range of the
spread of phase transitions. This distinction labels the phenomenon but does
not explain it. In this report we explore the analysis of these phenomena using
concepts of energy dissipation, the maintenance by cortex of multiple ground
states corresponding to AM patterns, and the exclusive selection by spontaneous

the entangling and the disentangling power. For two-qubit unitaries these two

different in general. We do so by constructing an explicit example of a
qubit-qutrit unitary whose entangling power is maximal (2 ebits), but whose
disentangling power is strictly less. A corollary is that there can be no
unique ordering for unitary gates in terms of their ability to perform
non-local tasks. Finally we show that in large dimensions, almost all bipartite
unitaries have entangling and disentangling capacities close to the maximal
possible (and thus in high dimensions the difference in these capacities is
small for almost all unitaries).

universality in the critical properties of the geometric phase in a family of

superconducting qubits in a line resonator as well as exciton states or
electron spin states of quantum dots in a cavity. The emergent dynamical
phenomena are strongly dependent on the relative energy scales of the
inter-qubit coupling strength, the coupling strength between qubits and cavity

by means of a similarity transformation to a physically equivalent Hermitian
Hamiltonian. This raises the following question: In which form of the quantum
theory, the non-Hermitian or the Hermitian one, is it easier to perform
calculations? This paper compares both forms of a non-Hermitian $ix^3$
quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian and demonstrates that it is much harder to
perform calculations in the Hermitian theory because the perturbation series
for the Hermitian Hamiltonian is constructed from divergent Feynman graphs. For
the Hermitian version of the theory, dimensional continuation is used to
regulate the divergent graphs that contribute to the ground-state energy and
the one-point Green's function. The results that are obtained are identical to
those found much more simply and without divergences in the non-Hermitian
PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. The $\mathcal{O}(g^4)$ contribution to the
ground-state energy of the Hermitian version of the theory involves graphs with
overlapping divergences, and these graphs are extremely difficult to regulate.
In contrast, the graphs for the non-Hermitian version of the theory are finite
to all orders and they are very easy to evaluate.

two counterpropagating laser beams with shifted spatial profiles. Under

motion of atoms in this state experiences effective vector and scalar
potentials. The associated magnetic field is oriented perpendicular to the
propagation direction of the laser beams. The field strength achievable is one
flux quantum over an area given by the transverse beam separation and the laser

that can be written by means of a suitable non-Hamiltonian bracket. As an
example, the theory is applied to the relaxation dynamics of the spin-boson

the operator approach is obtained. Moreover, the theory proposed in this paper
can take nonadiabatic effects into account without resorting to surface-hopping
approximations. Hence, the results obtained follow qualitatively those of
previous surface-hopping calculations and increase by a factor of (at least)
two the time length over which nonadiabatic dynamics can be propagated with
small statistical errors. Moreover, it is worth to note that the dynamics of
quantum-classical wave fields here proposed is a straightforward
non-Hamiltonian generalization of the formalism for non-linear quantum

2-particle electrodynamics, using the full electrodynamic force obtained from
the retarded Lienard-Wiechert potentials and the Lorentz force law. In
contrast, the usual formulation uses only the Coulomb force (scalar potential),
reducing the electrodynamic 2-body problem to a system of ordinary differential
equations (ODE's). The ODE formulation is mathematically suspect since FDE's
and ODE's are known to be incompatible; however, the Coulomb approximation to
the full electrodynamic force has been believed to be adequate for physics. We
can now test this long-standing belief by comparing the FDE solution with the
ODE solution, in the historically interesting case of the classical hydrogen
atom. The solutions differ.
  A key qualitative difference is that the full force involves a `delay'
torque. Our existing code is inadequate to calculate the detailed interaction
of the delay torque with radiative damping. However, a symbolic calculation
provides conditions under which the delay torque approximately balances (3rd
order) radiative damping. Thus, further investigations are required, and it was
prematurely concluded that radiative damping makes the classical hydrogen atom
unstable. Solutions of FDE's naturally exhibit an_infinite_ spectrum of
_discrete_ frequencies. The conclusion is that (a) the Coulomb force is_not_ a
valid approximation to the full electrodynamic force, so that (b) the n-body

molecular dynamics.

characteristic peaks associated with the bright and dark manifolds, and that
the ratio of the areas under the peaks is 16 as observed experimentally. We
also show that the shape of this distribution is sensitive to bath memory, but

suppose the state of the system is living in the symmetric subspace. It is
known that, in the limit of $m\to\infty$, entanglement between any two
subsystems vanishes.
  In this paper we study asymptotic behavior of the entanglement as $m$ and $n$
grows. Our conjecture is that if $m$ is a polynomially bounded function in $n$,
then the entanglement decreases polynomially.
  The motivation of this study is a study of quantum Merlin-Arthur game. If
this conjecture is ture, we can prove that bipartite separable certificate does
not increase the computational power of the proof system. protocol.
  In the paper, we provide two evidences which support the conjecture. First,
if $m$ is an exponential function, then entanglement decreases exponentially
fast. Second, in case of a maximally entangled state, our conjecture is true.

  oscillator bath with separable initial conditions</title><description>  The equation for the Wigner function describing the reduced dynamics of a
single harmonic oscillator, coupled to an oscillator bath, was obtained by
Karrlein and Grabert [Phys. Rev. E, vol. 55, 153 (1997)]. It was shown that for
some special correlated initial conditions the equation reduces, in the
classical limit, to the corresponding classical Fokker-Planck equation obtained
by Adelman [J. Chem Phys., vol. 64, 124 (1976)]. However for separable initial
conditions the Adelman equations were not recovered. We resolve this problem by
showing that, for separable initial conditions, the classical Langevin equation
obtained from the oscillator bath model is somewhat different from the one
considered by Adelman. We obtain the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation and
show that it exactly matches the classical limit of the equation for the Wigner
function obtained from the master equation for separable initial conditions. We
also discuss why the special correlated initial conditions correspond to
Adelman's solution.

reflectivity that can be fairly high. We analyze how the dipole potential in
which the atoms move is modified due to this backaction of the atoms. We show
that the position of the atoms can become bistable. These results are of a more

merge one party's state with another party's state is given by the conditional
entropy, which can be negative [Horodecki, Oppenheim, and Winter, Nature 436,
673 (2005)]. Here we find a classical analogue of this, based on a long known
relationship between entanglement and shared private correlations: namely, we
consider a private distribution held between two parties, and correlated to a
reference system, and ask how much secret communication is needed for one party
to send her distribution to the other. We give optimal protocols for this task,
and find that private information can be negative - the sender's distribution
can be transferred and the potential to send future distributions in secret is
gained through the distillation of a secret key. An analogue of `quantum state
exchange' is also discussed and one finds cases where exchanging a distribution
costs less than for one party to send it. The results give new classical
protocols, and also clarify the various relationships between entanglement and
privacy.

QFT the regions of space are, in fact, associated with a tensor product

optical dipole forces at the antinodes of a standing wave generated inside a
laser-driven cavity. The atoms arrange themselves into an array of lens-shaped
layers located at the antinodes of the standing wave. Light incident on this
array at a well-defined angle is partially Bragg-reflected. We measure
reflectivities as high as 30%. In contrast to a previous experiment devoted to
the thin grating limit [S. Slama, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 193901 (2005)]
we now investigate the thick grating limit characterized by multiple
reflections of the light beam between the atomic layers. In principle multiple
reflections give rise to a photonic stop band, which manifests itself in the
Bragg diffraction spectra as asymmetries and minima due to destructive
interference between different reflection paths. We show that close to
resonance however disorder favors diffuse scattering, hinders coherent multiple
scattering and impedes the characteristic suppression of spontaneous emission
inside a photonic band gap.

exhibiting, for example, the extent to which the two states are different. The
relative entropy of the states formed by reducing two n-party to a smaller
number $m$ of parties is always less than or equal to the relative entropy of
the two original n-party states. This is the monotonicity of relative entropy.
  Using techniques from convex geometry, we prove that monotonicity under
restrictions is the only general inequality satisfied by relative entropies. In
doing so we make a connection to secret sharing schemes with general access
structures.
  A suprising outcome is that the structure of allowed relative entropy values
of subsets of multiparty states is much simpler than the structure of allowed
entropy values. And the structure of allowed relative entropy values (unlike
that of entropies) is the same for classical probability distributions and
quantum states.

By the work of Aharonov and Ta-Shma, this implies that any language in
Statistical Zero Knowledge which is hard-on-average for quantum computers,

Impagliazzo and Luby to the quantum setting, we prove that quantum

  Quantum Gaussian Source</title><description>  Quantum random variable, distortion operator are introduced based on
canonical operators. As the lower bound of rate distortion, the entanglement
information rate distortion is achieved by Gaussian map for Gaussian source.
General Gaussian maps are further reduced to unitary transformations and
additive noises from the physical meaning of distortion. The entanglement
information rate distortion function then are calculated for one mode Gaussian
source. The rate distortion is accessible at zero distortion point. For pure
state, the rate distortion function is always zero. In contrast to the
distortion defined via fidelity, our definition of the distortion makes it
possible to calculate the entanglement information rate distortion function for
Gaussian source.

to show that, a photon inside a waveguide can be localized in the same sense
that a massive particle can be localized in free space, and just as that it is
impossible to localize a massive particle with a greater precision than its

  free energy into non-increasing components</title><description>  If an absolute reference frame with respect to time, position, or orientation
is missing one can only implement quantum operations which are covariant with
respect to the corresponding unitary symmetry group G. Extending observations
of Vaccaro et al., I argue that the free energy of a quantum system with
G-invariant Hamiltonian then splits up into the Holevo information of the orbit
of the state under the action of G and the free energy of its orbit average.
These two kinds of free energy cannot be converted into each other. The first
component is subadditive and the second superadditive; in the limit of
infinitely many copies only the usual free energy matters.
  Refined splittings of free energy into more than two independent
(non-increasing) terms can be defined by averaging over probability measures on
G that differ from the Haar measure.
  Even in the presence of a reference frame, these results provide lower bounds
on the amount of free energy that is lost after applying a covariant channel.
If the channel properly decreases one of these quantities, it decreases the
free energy necessarily at least by the same amount, since it is unable to
convert the different forms of free energies into each other.

exhibit the quantization of spin and understand the measurement problem in
quantum mechanics. However, although the Stern-Gerlach experiment plays an
essential role in the teaching of quantum mechanics, no complete analysis of
this experiment using Pauli spinors is presented in the pedagogical literature.
This paper presents such an analysis and develops implications for the theory
of quantum measurement.
  We first propose an analytic expression of both the wave function and the
probability density in the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Our explicit solution is
obtained via a complete integration of the Pauli equation over time and space.
The probability density evolution describes a slipping of the wave packet into
two separate packets due to the measurement device, but it cannot account for
impacts.
  We therefore calculate the de Broglie-Bohm trajectories, which not only
explain impacts naturally, but also accounts for the spin quantization
following the magnetic field gradient. It is then possible to propose a clear
explanation of measurement effects in the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

natural correspondence in optical cavities when the internal state of the atom
is treated as a harmonic oscillator. We derive a general expression for the
momentum diffusion which is valid for most configurations of interest: The atom
or the cavity or both can be probed by lasers, with or without the presence of
traps inducing local atomic frequency shifts. It is shown that, albeit the
(possibly strong) coupling between atom and cavity, it is sufficient for
deriving the momentum diffusion to consider that the atom couples to a mean
cavity field, which gives a first contribution, and that the cavity mode
couples to a mean atomic dipole, giving a second contribution. Both
contributions have an intuitive form and present a clear symmetry. The total
diffusion is the sum of these two contributions plus the diffusion originating
from the fluctuations of the forces due to the coupling to the vacuum modes
other than the cavity mode (the so called spontaneous emission term). Examples
are given that help to evaluate the heating rates induced by an optical cavity
for experiments operating at low atomic saturation. We also point out
intriguing situations where the atom is heated although it cannot scatter
light.

occurs. The four-level system can overcome some limits in the typical
lambda-type and V-type three-level systems, furthermore it is possible to
achieve lasing even in the absence of the inversion condition for the thermal
radiation fields or of the inversion of spontaneous decay rate. We find that
when the detuning of probe field is equal to that of coherent coupling field,
there is a peak value along with the increase of the detuning. To explain it,
we bring forward that there are adiabatic and nonadiabatic stimulated Raman
processes when a three-level atomic system is interacted with two coherent

believe that it can explain more general lasing without inversion processes
because of quantum interference induced by coherent fields.

such as classical and quantum source compression, noisy channel coding
theorems, entanglement distillation, etc., which characterize asymptotic
properties of quantum and classical channels and states. In this paper we
advocate a unified approach to an important class of problems in quantum
Shannon theory, consisting of those that are bipartite, unidirectional and
memoryless.
  We formalize two principles that have long been tacitly understood. First, we
describe how the Church of the larger Hilbert space allows us to move flexibly
between states, channels, ensembles and their purifications. Second, we
introduce finite and asymptotic (quantum) information processing resources as
the basic objects of quantum Shannon theory and recast the protocols used in
direct coding theorems as inequalities between resources. We develop the rules
of a resource calculus which allows us to manipulate and combine resource
inequalities. This framework simplifies many coding theorem proofs and provides
structural insights into the logical dependencies among coding theorems.
  We review the above-mentioned basic coding results and show how a subset of
them can be unified into a family of related resource inequalities. Finally, we
use this family to find optimal trade-off curves for all protocols involving
one noisy quantum resource and two noiseless ones.

The proposed circuit thus represents a more realistic mode of operation for

for any n unknown quantum states in an m-dimensional Hilbert space. The
discriminator is a fixed measurement that has two kinds of input registers: the
program registers and the data register. The quantum state in the data register
is what users want to identify, which is confirmed to be among the n states in
program registers. The task of the discriminator is to tell the users which
state stored in the program registers is equivalent to that in the data
register. First, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for judging an
unambiguous programmable discriminator. Then, if $m=n$, we present an optimal
unambiguous programmable discriminator for them, in the sense of maximizing the
worst-case probability of success. Finally, we propose a universal unambiguous
programmable discriminator for arbitrary n quantum states.

and standing wave shapes of the cavity mode are considered. An analytical
approximate measure for adiabaticity is given and compared with numerical wave
packet simulations. Good agreement is obtained where the approximations are
expected to be valid. Usually for cavity QED systems, the large atom-field
detuning case is considered as the adiabatic limit. We, however, show that
adiabaticity is also valid, for the Gaussian mode shape, in the opposite limit.
Effective semiclassical time dependent models, which do not take into account

many of the results presented can be applied to time dependent two-level

applies in the same form to a free particle, to one in an electromagnetic

the same, usual form of the Dirac equation--in special coordinates. To use the
equation in the static-gravitational case, we need to rewrite it in more
general coordinates. This can be done only if the usual, spinor transformation
of the wave function is replaced by the 4-vector transformation. We show that
the latter also makes the flat-space-time Dirac equation Lorentz-covariant,
although the Dirac matrices are not invariant. Because the equation itself is
left unchanged in the flat case, the 4-vector transformation does not alter the
main physical consequences of that equation in that case. However, the equation
derived in the static-gravitational case is not equivalent to the standard

$2^{n}\times 2^{m}$ image, $\ord(n+m)$ qubits are sufficient. Using the quantum
Fourier transform, it is possible to improve the fault tolerance of the quantum
algorithm by filtering out small-scale noise in the picture. For example images
with $512\times512$ pixels, we have numerically simulated the unitary
operations in order to demonstrate the applicability of the algorithm and to

coupled to a mesoscopic spin bath and weakly coupled to other environmental
degrees of freedom. Our analysis is specifically aimed at understanding the
quantum dynamics of solid-state quantum bits such as electron spins in
semiconductor structures and superconducting islands. The role of mesoscopic
degrees of freedom with long correlation times (local degrees of freedom such
as nuclear spins and charge traps) in qubit-related dephasing is discussed in
terms of a quasi-static bath. A mathemat- ical framework simultaneously
describing coupling to the slow mesoscopic bath and a Markovian environment is
developed and the dephasing and decoherence properties of the total system are
investigated. The model is applied to several specific examples with direct
relevance to current ex- periments. Comparisons to experiments suggests that
such quasi-static degrees of freedom play an important role in current qubit
implementations. Several methods of mitigating the bath-induced error are
considered.

simplest example of a two-mode system. This system has two exactly solvable
limits, the harmonic oscillator and a particle in a (one-dimensional) box. Each
of the two limits has a characteristic spectral structure describing the two
different excitation modes of the system. Near each of these limits, one can
use perturbation theory to achieve an accurate description of the eigenstates.
Away from the exact limits, however, one has to carry out a matrix
diagonalization because the basis-state mixing that occurs is typically too
large to be reproduced in any other way. An alternative to casting the problem
in terms of one or the other basis set consists of using an &quot;oblique&quot; basis
that uses both sets. Through a study of this alternative in this
one-dimensional problem, we are able to illustrate practical solutions and
infer the applicability of the concept for more complex systems, such as in the
study of complex nuclei where oblique-basis calculations have been successful.
Keywords: one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, particle in a box, exactly
solvable models, two-mode system, oblique basis states, perturbation theory,

the entanglement entropy of a half-chain stays finite. Examples demonstrate
that these kinds of transitions can occur at the triple point of `conventional'

gravity determines the structure of spinning particle in the form of a

By changing the frequencies of the comb in time the gratings can easily be

novel scheme for quantum systems defined on a D-dimensional lattice. It is
based on a coarse-graining transformation that attempts to reduce the amount of
entanglement of a block of lattice sites before truncating its Hilbert space.
Numerical simulations involving the ground state of a 1D system at criticality
show that the resulting coarse-grained site requires a Hilbert space dimension
that does not grow with successive rescaling transformations. As a result we
can address, in a quasi-exact way, tens of thousands of quantum spins with a
computational effort that scales logarithmically in the system's size. The
calculations unveil that ground state entanglement in extended quantum systems
is organized in layers corresponding to different length scales. At a quantum
critical point, each rellevant length scale makes an equivalent contribution to
the entanglement of a block with the rest of the system.

opinion poll, currency exchange rate, electrical current, chemical reactions -
they all permanently fluctuate. One of the most important questions is why the
systems that exert fluctuations stay long-term stable. Is there any general
functional relation that provides long-term stability despite the wide
diversity of the fluctuations commence: emotions, economics, physical
interactions etc? I assert that such functional relation does exist and reveal
its specification: the route to the long-term stability is through coherence
and boundedness as necessary conditions. It is demonstrated that the chaoticity
is the hallmark of that relationship. The present contribution is a systematic
study written as a book on the relation between long-term stability and
exerting macroscopic fluctuations. Further attention is focused on the
mechanism that guarantees the boundedness and the coherence of the local
fluctuations in the physical systems. Crucial arguments that neither of the
existing so far approaches to the behavior of the extended many-body systems
provides boundedness and coherence of the fluctuations are put forward. It
turns out that the mechanism that brings about macroscopic fluctuations has
universal properties and entangles quantum decoherence, chaos and 1/f noise in
a tricky interplay.

These measures possess the unusual property of being computable with linear

evaluate these measures for the non-Gaussian mixed states which are generated
by photon subtraction with on/off photon detectors. The results are compared
with the behavior of certain operational measures, namely the teleportation
fidelity and the mutual information in the dense coding scheme. It is found
that all of these results are mutually consistent, in the sense that whenever
the enhancement is seen in terms of the operational measures, the negativity
and the logarithmic negativity are also enhanced.

imperfect on/off-type photon detector on a splitted beam from a wideband
squeezed light. The events are defined for finite time duration $T$ in the time
domain. The non-Gaussian output state is measured by the homodyne detector with
finite bandwidh $B$. Under this time- and band-limitation to the quantm states,
we develop a formalism to evaluate the frequency mode matching between the
on/off trigger channel and the conditional signal beam in the homodyne channel.
Our formalism is applied to the CW and pulsed schemes. We explicitly calculate
the Wigner function of the conditional non-Gaussian output state in a realistic
situation. Good mode matching is achieved for $BT\alt1$, where the discreteness
of modes becomes prominant, and only a few modes become dominant both in the
on/off and the homodyne channels. If the trigger beam is projected nearly onto
the single photon state in the most dominant mode in this regime, the most
striking non-classical effect will be observed in the homodyne statistics. The
increase of $BT$ and the dark counts degrades the non-classical effect.

the $z$-component of the spin of a (spin 1/2) particle driven by a magnetic
field, controlled along the x axis, with bounded amplitude. On the Bloch sphere
(i.e. after a suitable Hopf projection), this problem can be attacked with
techniques of optimal syntheses on 2-D manifolds. Let $(-E,E)$ be the two
energy levels, and $|\Omega(t)|\leq M$ the bound on the field amplitude. For
each couple of values $E$ and $M$, we determine the time optimal synthesis
starting from the level $-E$ and we provide the explicit expression of the time
optimal trajectories steering the state one to the state two, in terms of a
parameter that can be computed solving numerically a suitable equation. For
$M/E&lt;&lt;1$, every time optimal trajectory is bang-bang and in particular the
corresponding control is periodic with frequency of the order of the resonance
frequency $\omega_R=2E$. On the other side, for $M/E&gt;1$, the time optimal
trajectory steering the state one to the state two is bang-bang with exactly
one switching. Fixed $E$ we also prove that for $M\to\infty$ the time needed to
reach the state two tends to zero. In the case $M/E&gt;1$ there are time optimal
trajectories containing a singular arc. Finally we compare these results with
some known results of Khaneja, Brockett and Glaser and with those obtained by
controlling the magnetic field both on the $x$ and $y$ directions (or with one
external field, but in the rotating wave approximation). As byproduct we prove
that the qualitative shape of the time optimal synthesis presents different
patterns, that cyclically alternate as $M/E\to0$, giving a partial proof of a
conjecture formulated in a previous paper.

there exist physical transformations T_{n} (trace preserving quantum channels)
which map the qubits states asymptotically close to their corresponding

  A few consequences of the main result are derived. We show that the optimal

which is the optimal joint measurement of position and momentum for the quantum

approach to solving the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) is a special case of the
state identification problem where the ensemble consists of so-called coset
states of candidate hidden subgroups. Combining Fourier sampling with our
random POVM result gives us single register algorithms using polynomially many
copies of the coset state that identify hidden subgroups having polynomially
bounded rank in every representation of the ambient group. These HSP algorithms
complement earlier results about the powerlessness of random Fourier sampling
when the ranks are exponentially large, which happens for example in the HSP
over the symmetric group. The drawback of random Fourier sampling based
algorithms is that they are not efficient because measuring in a random basis
is not. This leads us to the open question of efficiently implementable
pseudo-random measurement bases.

in a semiconductor background is calculated within the Heitler-London (HL)
approximation. Atomic and quantum dot types of confining potentials are
considered, and a systematic analysis for the source of inaccuracies in the HL
approach is presented. For the strongly confining coulombic atomic potentials
in the H2 molecule, the most dramatic failure occurs at very large interatomic
distances, where HL predicts a triplet ground state, both in 3D and in 2D,
coming from the absence of electron-electron correlation effects in this
approach. For a 2D double well potential, failures are identified at relatively
smaller interdot distances, and may be attributed to the less confining nature
of the potential, leading to larger overlap and consequently an inadequate
representation of the two-particle states written, within HL, in terms of the
ground state orbital at each isolated well. We find that in the double dot
case, the range of validity of HL is improved (restricted) in a related 3D (1D)
model, and that results always tend to become more reliable as the interdot
distance increases. Our calculated exchange coupling is of relevance to the
exchange gate quantum computer architectures in semiconductors.

coupling to the lattice nuclear spin bath in a semiconductor quantum computer
architecture. In the presence of an external magnetic field and at low
temperatures, the dominant decoherence mechanism is the spectral diffusion of
the electron spin resonance frequency due to the temporally fluctuating random
magnetic field associated with the dipolar interaction induced flip-flops of
nuclear spin pairs. The electron spin dephasing due to this random magnetic
field depends intricately on the quantum dynamics of the nuclear spin bath,
making the coupled decoherence problem difficult to solve. We provide a
formally exact solution of this non-Markovian quantum decoherence problem which
numerically calculates accurate spin decoherence at short times, which is of
particular relevance in solid-state spin quantum computer architectures. A
quantum cluster expansion method is developed, motivated, and tested for the
problem of localized electron spin decoherence due to dipolar fluctuations of
lattice nuclear spins. The method is presented with enough generality for
possible application to other types of spin decoherence problems. We present
numerical results which are in quantitative agreement with electron spin echo
measurements in phosphorus doped silicon. We also present spin echo decay
results for quantum dots in GaAs which differ qualitatively from that of the
phosphorus doped silicon system. Our theoretical results provide the ultimate
limit on the spin coherence (at least, as characterized by Hahn spin echo
measurements) of localized electrons in semiconductors in the low temperature

univariate Sturm-Liouville problem on a quantum computer. This general problem
includes the special case of solving a one-dimensional Schroedinger equation
with a given potential for the ground state energy.
  The Sturm-Liouville problem depends on a function q, which, in the case of
the Schroedinger equation, can be identified with the potential function V.
Recently Papageorgiou and Wozniakowski proved that quantum computers achieve an
exponential reduction in the number of queries over the number needed in the
classical worst-case and randomized settings for smooth functions q. Their
method uses the (discretized) unitary propagator and arbitrary powers of it as
a query (&quot;power queries&quot;). They showed that the Sturm-Liouville equation can be
solved with O(log(1/e)) power queries, while the number of queries in the
worst-case and randomized settings on a classical computer is polynomial in
1/e. This proves that a quantum computer with power queries achieves an
exponential reduction in the number of queries compared to a classical
computer.
  In this paper we show that the number of queries in Papageorgiou's and
Wozniakowski's algorithm is asymptotically optimal. In particular we prove a
matching lower bound of log(1/e) power queries, therefore showing that log(1/e)
power queries are sufficient and necessary. Our proof is based on a frequency
analysis technique, which examines the probability distribution of the final
state of a quantum algorithm and the dependence of its Fourier transform on the

sources can be fully verified without any reference to some other trusted set
of quantum devices. Our main assumption is that the physical system we are
working with consists of several identifiable sub-systems, on which we can
apply some given gates locally.
  To achieve our goal we define the notions of simulation and equivalence. The
concept of simulation refers to producing the correct probabilities when
measuring physical systems. To enable the efficient testing of the composition
of quantum operations, we introduce the notion of equivalence. Unlike
simulation, which refers to measured quantities (i.e., probabilities of
outcomes), equivalence relates mathematical objects like states, subspaces or
gates.
  Using these two concepts, we prove that if a system satisfies some simulation
conditions, then it is equivalent to the one it is purposed to implement. In
addition, with our formalism, we can show that these statements are robust, and
the degree of robustness can be made explicit (unlike the robustness results of
[DMMS00]). In particular, we also prove the robustness of the EPR Test [MY98].
Finally, we design a test for any quantum circuit whose complexity is linear in
the number of gates and qubits, and polynomial in the required precision.

ground electronic spin states, detection of light scattering from the
intermediate exciton state acts as a weak quantum measurement of the effective
magnetic (Overhauser) field due to the nuclear spins. If the spin were driven
into a coherent population trapping state where no light scattering takes
place, then the nuclear state would be projected into an eigenstate of the
Overhauser field operator and electron decoherence due to nuclear spins would
be suppressed: we show that this limit can be approached by adapting the laser
frequencies when a photon is detected. We use a Lindblad equation to describe
the time evolution of the driven system under photon emission and detection.
Numerically, we find an increase of the electron coherence time from 5 ns to

observables we consider are constructed as integrals over the space of
coordinates, in analogy to the construction of gauge-invariant observables in
Yang-Mills theory via traces. As such, they are explicitly non-local.
Nevertheless we describe how, in suitable quantum states and in a suitable
limit, the familiar physics of local quantum field theory can be recovered from
appropriate such observables, which we term `pseudo-local.' We consider
measurement of pseudo-local observables, and describe how such measurements are
limited by both quantum effects and gravitational interactions. These
limitations support suggestions that theories of quantum gravity associated
with finite regions of spacetime contain far fewer degrees of freedom than do
local field theories.

Using the formalism of quantum gates acting on spin and mode degrees of

Schr\&quot;{o}dinger problem is further developed. As previously, theoretical
developments are demonstrated on example of diatomic xenon molecule in its
ground electronic state. An exactly solvable reference potential for this
quantum system is used, which enables to solve the related energy eigenvalue
problem exactly. Moreover, the full energy dependence of the phase shift can
also be calculated analytically, and as a particular result, full agreement
with Levinson theorem has been achieved and explicitly demonstrated. In
principle, this important spectral information can be reused to calculate an
improved potential for the system, and such possibilities are discussed in the
paper. Aiming at this goal, one may calculate an auxiliary potential with no
bound states, whose spectral density for positive energies is exactly the same
as that of the reference potential. To this end, one may solve Krein equation,
which in the present context is simpler than using Gelfand-Levitan method.
General solution of Krein equation can be expressed as a Neumann series.
Convergence of this series of multi-dimensional integrals at distances not
close to the origin is hard to achieve without a simple asymptotic formula for
calculating the kernel of Krein equation. As proven in this paper, such an
asymptotic formula exists, and its parameters can be easily ascertained.

samples dispersively interact with high-finesse optical cavities. A stable far
detuned optical lattice of several million rubidium atoms is formed inside an
optical ring resonator by coupling equal amounts of laser light to each
propagation direction of a longitudinal cavity mode. An adjacent longitudinal
mode, detunedby about 3 GHz, is used to perform probe transmission spectroscopy
of the system. The atom-cavity coupling for the lattice beams and the probe is
dispersive and dissipation results only from the finite photon-storage time.
The observation of two well-resolved normal modes demonstrates the regime of
strong cooperative coupling. The details of the normal mode spectrum reveal
mechanical effects associated with the retroaction of the probe upon the

a probability interpretation and a suitable dynamics, but has no obvious
classical correspondence. Allowing the Lagrangian or the action functional to
take values in a general Lie algebra instead of only the real number field

long-distance quantum communication with atomic ensembles is analyzed. Its
fidelity and throughput in entanglement distribution, entanglement swapping,

multiple excitations in the ensembles as well as loss and asymmetries in the
channel. The DLCZ performance metrics that are obtained are compared to the
corresponding results for the trapped-atom quantum communication architecture
that has been proposed by a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology

high-fidelity entanglement distribution. However, the DLCZ scheme only provides
conditional teleportation and repeater operation, whereas the MIT/NU
architecture affords full Bell-state measurements on its trapped atoms.
Moreover, it is shown that achieving unity conditional fidelity in DLCZ
teleportation and repeater operation requires ideal photon-number resolving
detectors. The maximum conditional fidelities for DLCZ teleportation and
repeater operation that can be realized with non-resolving detectors are 1/2
and 2/3, respectively.

quantum system, and based on this we propose a new type of computing machine,
the duality computer, that may outperform in principle both classical computer
and the quantum computer.
  According to the general principle of quantum interference, the very essence
of quantum interference is the interference of the sub-waves of the quantum
system itself. A quantum system considered here can be any quantum system: a
single microscopic particle, a composite quantum system such as an atom or a
molecule, or a loose collection of a few quantum objects such as two
independent photons.
  In the duality computer, the wave of the duality computer is split into
several sub-waves and they pass through different routes, where different
computing gate operations are performed. These sub-waves are then re-combined
to interfere to give the computational results. The quantum computer, however,
has only used the particle nature of quantum object. In a duality computer, it
may be possible to find a marked item from an unsorted database using only a
single query, and all NP-complete problems may have polynomial algorithms. Two
proof-of-the-principle designs of the duality computer are presented: the giant
molecule scheme and the nonlinear quantum optics scheme. We also proposed
thought experiment to check the related fundamental issues, the measurement
efficiency of a partial wave function

  variable systems: Quantification, sharing structure and decoherence</title><description>  We present a complete analysis of multipartite entanglement of three-mode
Gaussian states of continuous variable systems. We derive standard forms which
characterize the covariance matrix of pure and mixed three-mode Gaussian states
up to local unitary operations, showing that the local entropies of pure
Gaussian states are bound to fulfill a relationship which is stricter than the
general Araki-Lieb inequality. Quantum correlations will be quantified by a
proper convex roof extension of the squared logarithmic negativity (the
contangle), satisfying a monogamy relation for multimode Gaussian states, whose
proof will be reviewed and elucidated. The residual contangle, emerging from
the monogamy inequality, is an entanglement monotone under Gaussian local
operations and classical communication and defines a measure of genuine
tripartite entanglement. We analytically determine the residual contangle for
arbitrary pure three-mode Gaussian states and study the distribution of quantum
correlations for such states. This will lead us to show that pure, symmetric
states allow for a promiscuous entanglement sharing, having both maximum
tripartite residual entanglement and maximum couplewise entanglement between
any pair of modes. We thus name these states GHZ/$W$ states of continuous
variable systems because they are simultaneous continuous-variable counterparts
of both the GHZ and the $W$ states of three qubits. We finally consider the
action of decoherence on tripartite entangled Gaussian states, studying the
decay of the residual contangle. The GHZ/$W$ states are shown to be maximally
robust under both losses and thermal noise.

quantum computations. The model itself and many works dedicated to it involve
using entangled qubits. In this paper we consider the issue of using entangled
qudits instead. We present a complete framework for cluster state quantum
computation using qudits, which not only contains the features of the original
qubit model but also contains the new idea of adaptive computation: via a
change in the classical computation that helps to correct the errors that are
inherent in the model, the implemented quantum computation can be changed. This
feature arises through the extra degrees of freedom that appear when using
qudits. Finally, for prime dimensions, we give a very explicit description of

  Applications (Ph.D Thesis)</title><description>  The coherence properties of broadband down converted light are investigated
theoretically and experimentally in both the classical and quantum mechanical
frameworks. Although broadband down converted light is one-photon incoherent
noise, it possesses unique two-photon coherence. Thus, for performing
two-photon processes, down-converted light is equivalent to coherent ultrashort
pulses in some aspects and to coherent CW laser radiation in others. This
equivalence is theoretically established and experimentally demonstrated in the
classical, high-power regime. Two applications that take advantage of
multi-photon coherence are then described in detail; one for optical spread
spectrum communication and the other for sub-diffraction limit optical
lithography. A key part of this research is the design and implementation of an
efficient source that generates high-power broadband down conversion in a
cavity. A broadband oscillation in the cavity is ensured by a mechanism very
similar to passive mode-locking of ultrashort pulse laser sources, which we
term as pair-wise mode locking, thus extending the equivalence to ultrashort
pulses to the light generating sources also. Finally, the quantum mechanical
properties of broadband down-conversion are explored experimentally, by
performing a two-photon process (sum frequency generation) at the low power
level of entangled photon pairs. The non-classical nature of the light is
expressed by a linear intensity dependence of the non-linear process. Temporal
shaping with femtosecond resolution of the entangled photon pairs is
demonstrated using this non-linear interaction.

assistance consists of Charlie initially performing a measurement on his share

they are allowed to make use of a two-way classical channel with Charlie. We
show that the latter quantity, which we call the entanglement of collaboration,
can be greater than the entanglement of assistance. This demonstrates that the
entanglement of assistance (considered as a tripartite measure of
entanglement), and its multipartite generalizations such as the localizable
entanglement, are not entanglement monotones, thereby undermining their
operational significance.

Bell test, though, is not the only criterion by which the quantum-mechanical
and local realist models can be judged. It is suggested that the
quantum-mechanical models given in the proposals will also fail in their
detailed predictions. If the experiments are extended by including a range of
parameter values and by analysing, in addition to the proposed digitised

  field propagation in a cavity</title><description>  We consider three two-level atoms inside a one-dimensional cavity,
interacting with the electromagnetic field in the rotating wave approximation
(RWA), commonly used in the atom-radiation interaction. One of the three atoms
is initially excited, and the other two are in their ground state. We
numerically calculate the propagation of the field spontaneously emitted by the
excited atom and scattered by the second atom, as well as the excitation
probability of the second and third atom. The results obtained are analyzed
from the point of view of relativistic causality in the atom-field interaction.
We show that, when the RWA is used, relativistic causality is obtained only if
the integrations over the field frequencies are extended to $-\infty$; on the
contrary, noncausal tails remain even if the number of field modes is
increased. This clearly shows the limit of the RWA in dealing with subtle
problems such as relativistic causality in the atom-field interaction.

positronium atom in an ultra-relativistic regime, and a (hypercritical) value
for the magnetic field is determined, which provides the full compensation of
the positronium rest mass by the binding energy in the maximum symmetry state.
The compensation becomes possible owing to the falling to the center
phenomenon. The relativistic form in two-dimensional Minkowsky space is derived
for the four-dimensional Bethe-Salpeter equation in the limit of an infinitely

the positronium rest mass is compensated by the mass defect the energy barrier

distillability. Hence, bound entangled states do not violate it. In the
multipartite case we consider the complete set of full-correlation Bell

WWZB-inequalities. We show that asymptotic violation of any of these

require that some of the parties join into several groups. We also obtain the
extreme points of the set of distributions generated by measuring $N$ quantum

discrete, bosonic mode pairs, each pair undergoing independent evolution into a
two-mode squeezed state. For this we extend the Bloch-Messiah reduction
theorem, previously known for discrete linear systems (S. L. Braunstein, Phys.
Rev. A, vol. 71, 055801 (2005)). We present typical mode functions in the case
of one-dimensional scattering in an atomic vapor. We find that in the absence
of dispersion, one mode pair dominates the process, leading to a simple
interpretation of entanglement in this continuous-variable system. However,
many mode pairs are excited in the presence of dispersion-induced temporal
walkoff of the Stokes, as witnessed by the photon-count statistics. We also
consider the readout of the stored atomic polarization using the anti-Stokes
scattering process. We prove that the readout process can also be decomposed
into multiple mode pairs, each pair undergoing independent evolution analogous
to a beam-splitter transformation. We show that this process can have unit
efficiency under realistic experimental conditions. The shape of the output
light wave packet can be predicted. In case of unit readout efficiency it
contains only excitations originating from a specified atomic excitation mode.

Furthermore, the probability that the pointer will indicate a given average

$\bar D$ and a noiseless quantum channel of dimension $D$ is studied both in
the deterministic case where at most $L_d$ messages can be transmitted with
perfect fidelity, and in the unambiguous case where when the protocol succeeds
(probability $\tau_x$) Bob knows for sure that Alice sent message $x$, and when
it fails (probability $1-\tau_x$) he knows it has failed. Alice is allowed any
single-shot (one use) encoding procedure, and Bob any single-shot measurement.
For $\bar D\leq D$ a bound is obtained for $L_d$ in terms of the largest
Schmidt coefficient of the entangled state, and is compared with published
results by Mozes et al. For $\bar D &gt; D$ it is shown that $L_d$ is strictly
less than $D^2$ unless $\bar D$ is an integer multiple of $D$, in which case
uniform (maximal) entanglement is not needed to achieve the optimal protocol.
The unambiguous case is studied for $\bar D \leq D$, assuming $\tau_x&gt;0$ for a
set of $\bar D D$ messages, and a bound is obtained for the average
$\lgl1/\tau\rgl$. A bound on the average $\lgl\tau\rgl$ requires an additional
assumption of encoding by isometries (unitaries when $\bar D=D$) that are
orthogonal for different messages. Both bounds are saturated when $\tau_x$ is a
constant independent of $x$, by a protocol based on one-shot entanglement
concentration. For $\bar D &gt; D$ it is shown that (at least) $D^2$ messages can
be sent unambiguously. Whether unitary (isometric) encoding suffices for
optimal protocols remains a major unanswered question, both for our work and
for previous studies of dense coding using partially-entangled states,
including noisy (mixed) states.

with the linearity and causality of quantum mechanics, the concept of quantum
cloning machines is sketched, following, whenever possible, the chronology of
the main results. The important classes of quantum cloning machines are
reviewed, in particular state-independent and state-dependent cloning machines.
The 1-to-2 cloning problem is then studied from a formal point of view, using
the isomorphism between completely positive maps and operators, which leads to
the so-called double-Bell ansatz. This also yields an efficient numerical
approach to quantum cloning, based on semidefinite programming methods. The
derivation of the optimal N-to-M universal cloning machine in d dimensions is
then detailed, as well as the notion of asymmetric cloning machines. In the
second part of this review, the optical implementation of cloning machines is
considered. It is shown that the universal cloning of photons can be achieved
by parametric amplification of light or by symmetrization via the
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. The various experimental demonstrations of quantum
cloning machines are reviewed. The cloning of orthogonally polarized photons is
also considered, as well as the asymmetric and phase-covariant cloning of
photons. Finally, the extension of quantum cloning to continuous variables is

  in a silicon-based quantum computer with constant interaction</title><description>  We describe how to implement quantum logic operations in a silicon-based
quantum computer with phosphorus atoms serving as qubits. The information is
stored in the states of nuclear spins and the conditional logic operations are
implemented through the electron spins using nuclear-electron hyperfine and
electron-electron exchange interactions. The electrons in our computer should
stay coherent only during implementation of one Control-Not gate. The exchange
interaction is constant and selective excitations are provided by a magnetic
field gradient. The quantum logic operations are implemented by rectangular
radio-frequency pulses. This architecture is scalable and does not require
manufacturing nanoscale electronic gates. As shown in this paper parameters of
a quantum protocol can be derived analytically even for a computer with a large
number of qubits using our perturbation approach. We present the protocol for
initialization of the nuclear spins and the protocol for creation of
entanglement. All analytical results are tested numerically using a two-qubit
system.

that within this approach quantum causality can be rehabilitated in the form of

insuring the consistency of the histories, is called the nondemolition, or
causality principle in modern quantum theory. The application of this rule in
the form of the dynamical commutation relations leads in particular to the

the final band populations on the initial populations and phases. Most
importantly, additionally to the known asymmetric dependence on the
nonlinearity, there is also a notable asymmetry in the sensitivity of the
tunneling probability to the nonliearity-induced initial population of the
Bloch band to which the tunneling takes place. This fact can explain the
experimentally observed unexpected independence of the upper-to-lower tunneling
probablity on the nonlinearity. Finally, we compare the predictions of the
two-band model with that of the well-known nonlinear Landau-Zener model and
find disagreement when the two bands are initially populated. The disagreement
can be qualitative and reveals itself even for a negligible nonlinearity.
However, the two models agree remarkably well if just one band is populated

particles of spin-1/2. To make nonlocal properties appropriately involved in a
quantum theory, the special unitary group SU(n) and spinor representation
$D^{(1/2,1/2)}$ of Lorentz group are generalized by making complex
spaces--which are spanned by wave functions of quantum particles--curved. The
curved spaces are described by the geometry used in General Relativity by
replacing the real space with complex space and additionally imposing the
analytic condition on the space. The field equations for fermions and for
bosons are respectively associated with geodesic motion equations and with
local curvature of the considered space. The equation for fermions can restore
all the terms of quadratic form of Dirac equation. According to the field
equation it is found that, for the U(1) field [generalized Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED)], when the electromagnetic fields $\vec E$ and $\vec B$
satisfy $\vec E^2-\vec B^2\neq 0$, the bosons will gain masses. In this model,
a physical region is empirically defined, which can be characterized by a

a sequential time continuous conditioning of an input quantum process by the

fully outside the initial state or the inner region at intermediate times,
i.e., to a completely reconstructed state, whereas the decay during the
exponential regime is due instead to a non-reconstructed wave. At short times
quantum interference between regenerated and non-regenerated paths is
responsible for the deviation from the exponential decay. We may thus conclude
that state reconstruction is a ``consistent history'' for long time deviations
but not for short ones.

noninteracting. The encoding input states obey a set of physically motivated
constraints on the mean values of the energy and particle number. In such a
case, the determination of both classical and quantum capacity reduces to a
constrained maximization of entropy. In the case of noninteracting bosons,
signatures of Bose Einstein condensation can be observed in the behavior of the
capacity. A major motivation for these considerations is to compare the
information carrying capacities of channels that carry bosons with those that
carry fermions. We show analytically that fermions generally provide higher
channel capacity, i.e., they are better suited for transferring bits as well as
qubits, in comparison to bosons. This holds for a large range of power law
potentials, and for moderate to high temperatures. Numerical simulations seem
to indicate that the result holds for all temperatures. Also, we consider the
low temperature behavior for the three-dimensional box and harmonic trap, and
again we show that the fermionic capacity is higher than the bosonic one for
sufficiently low temperatures.

  and Filtering</title><description>  It is shown that many dissipative phenomena of &quot;old&quot; quantum mechanics which
appeared 100 years ago in the form of the statistics of quantum thermal noise
and quantum spontaneous jumps, have never been explained by the &quot;new&quot;
conservative quantum mechanics discovered 75 years ago by Heisenberg and
Schroedinger. This led to numerous quantum paradoxes which are reconsidered in
this paper. The development of quantum measurement theory, initiated by von
Neumann, indicated a possibility for resolution of this interpretational crisis
by divorcing the algebra of the dynamical generators from the algebra of the
actual observables. It is shown that within this approach quantum causality can
be rehabilitated in the form of a superselection rule for compatibility of past
observables with the potential future. This rule, together with the
self-compatibility of measurements insuring the consistency of histories, is
called the nondemolition principle. The application of this causality condition
in the form of the dynamical commutation relations leads to the derivation of
the generalized von Neumann reductions, usharp, instantaneous, spontaneous, and
even continuous in time. This gives a quantum probabilistic solution, in the
form of the dynamical filtering equations, of the notorious measurement problem
which was tackled unsuccessfully by many famous physicists starting with
Schroedinger and Bohr. The simplest Markovian quantum stochastic model for the
continuous in time measurements involves a boundary-value problem in second
quantization for input &quot;offer&quot; waves in one extra dimension, and a reduction of
the algebra of &quot;actual&quot; observables to an Abelian subalgebra for the output
waves.

solve certain problems and perform certain tasks more efficiently than
conventional computers. Among other reasons, this is due to the possibility of
creating non-classical correlations, or quantum entanglement, which is a
phenomena hard or impossible to reproduce by classical-information methods.
  In this thesis I first investigate the simulation of quantum systems on a
quantum computer constructed of two-level quantum elements or qubits. For this
purpose, I present algebra mappings that allow one to obtain physical
properties and compute correlation functions of fermionic, anyonic, and bosonic
systems with such a computer. The results obtained show that the complexity of
preparing a quantum state which contains the desired information for the
computation is crucial.
  Second, I present a wide class of quantum computations, which could involve
entangled states, that can be simulated with the same efficiency on both types
of computers. The notion of generalized quantum entanglement then naturally
emerges. This generalization of entanglement is based on the idea that
entanglement is an observer-dependent concept, that is, relative to a set of
preferred observables.

in an efficient manner, with the help of sequential measurements on at least
two unbiased bases. However here we found that, when the system is affected by
a decoherence mechanism, only one observable is required in order to achieve
the same goal. In this way the decoherence can assist the process. We show
that, depending on the sort of decoherence, the process can converge faster or
slower than the method implemented by means of two complementary observables.

In the absence of any disorder the block entropy increases linearly with time

Conclusive
falsification is highly desirable as it would provide support for the most
profoundly counterintuitive feature of quantum theory - nonlocality. Despite
the preponderance of evidence for quantum mechanics, practical limits on
detector efficiency and the difficulty of coordinating space-like separated
measurements have provided loopholes for a classical worldview; these loopholes
have never been simultaneously closed. A number of new experiments have
recently been proposed to close both loopholes at once. We show some of these
novel designs fail in the most basic way, by not ruling out local hidden
variable models, and we provide an explicit classical model to demonstrate
this. They share a common flaw, which reveals a basic misunderstanding of how
nonlocality proofs work. Given the time and resources now being devoted to such
experiments, theoretical clarity is essential. Our explanation is presented in
terms of simple logic and should serve to correct misconceptions and avoid
future mistakes. We also show a nonlocality proof involving four participants
which has interesting theoretical properties.

of this process can be decomposed into characteristic modes undergoing
independent squeezing evolution akin to the Schmidt decomposition of the
biphoton spectrum. The main features of this decomposition can be understood
using a simple analytical model developed in the perturbative regime. In the
strong pumping regime, for which the perturbative approach is not valid, we
present a numerical analysis, specializing to the case of one-dimensional

detection of squeezing. For a weak parametric process, efficient squeezing is
found in a broad range of local oscillator modes, whereas the intense

particles with some environment. The effect of decoherence is counteracted by a
simple mechanism, where system particles are randomly reset to some standard
initial state, e.g. by replacing them with particles from the environment. We
present a master equation that describes this process, which we can solve

a quantum information processing primitive, state merging, that optimally
merges the state into one location. As announced in [Horodecki, Oppenheim,
Winter, Nature 436, 673 (2005)], the optimal entanglement cost of this task is
the conditional entropy if classical communication is free. Since this quantity
can be negative, and the state merging rate measures partial quantum
information, we find that quantum information can be negative. The classical
communication rate also has a minimum rate: a certain quantum mutual
information. State merging enabled one to solve a number of open problems:
distributed quantum data compression, quantum coding with side information at
the decoder and sender, multi-party entanglement of assistance, and the
capacity of the quantum multiple access channel. It also provides an
operational proof of strong subadditivity. Here, we give precise definitions
and prove these results rigorously.

environment (bath) is studied through some simple examples. The system is
considered to be a simple spin-half particle which is weakly coupled to the
bath. It is seen that even in this regime the geometric phase can vary with
temperature. In addition, we also consider the system under an adiabatically
time-varying magnetic field which is weakly coupled to the bath. An important
feature of this model is that it reveals existence of a temperature-scale in
which adiabaticity condition is preserved and beyond which the geometric phase
is varying quite rapidly with temperature. This temperature is exactly the one
in which the geometric phase vanishes. This analysis has some implications in
realistic implementations of geometric quantum computation.

understand and regularize our observations of a very large class of natural
phenomena, and yet, it is one of the most contentious concepts of physics. In
this article, we review two expositions of thermodynamics, one without
reference to quantum theory, and the other quantum mechanical without
probabilities of statistical mechanics. In the first, we show that entropy is
an inherent property of any system in any state, and that its analytical
expression must conform to eight criteria. In the second, we recognize that
quantum thermodynamics: (i) admits quantum probabilities described either by
wave functions or by nonstatistical density operators; and (ii) requires a
nonlinear equation of motion that is delimited by but more general than the
Schroedinger equation, and that accounts for both reversible and irreversible
evolutions of the state of the system in time. Both the more general quantum
probabilities, and the equation of motion have been defined, and the three laws
of thermodynamics are shown to be theorems of this equation.

entanglement measure. This measure can be applied to a much wider class of
multipartite mixed states, although still &quot;quasi&quot; in the sense that it is still
incapable of dividing precisely the sets of all separable and entangled states.
As a quadratic scalar function of the system density matrix, the quasi measure
can be easily expressed in terms of the so-called coherence vector of the
system density matrix, by which we show the basic properties of the quasi
measure including (1) zero-entanglement for all separable states, (2)
invariance under local unitary operations, and (3) non-increasing under local
POVM (positive operator-valued measure) measurements. These results open up
perspectives in further studies of dynamical problems in open systems,
especially the dynamic evolution of entanglement, and the entanglement
preservation against the environment-induced decoherence effects.

  entanglement with vacuum</title><description>  We analyze an example of a photon in superposition of different modes, and
ask what is the degree of their entanglement with vacuum. The problem turns out
to be ill-posed since we do not know which representation of the algebra of
canonical commutation relations (CCR) to choose for field quantization. Once we
make a choice, we can solve the question of entanglement unambiguously. So the
difficulty is not with mathematics, but with physics of the problem. In order
to make the discussion explicit we analyze from this perspective a popular
argument based on a photon leaving a beam splitter and interacting with two
two-level atoms. We first solve the problem algebraically in Heisenberg
picture, without any assumption about the form of representation of CCR. Then
we take the $\infty$-representation and show in two ways that in two-mode
states the modes are maximally entangled with vacuum, but single-mode states
are not entangled. Next we repeat the analysis in terms of the representation
of CCR taken from Berezin's book and show that two-mode states do not involve
the mode-vacuum entanglement. Finally, we switch to a family of reducible
representations of CCR recently investigated in the context of field
quantization, and show that the entanglement with vacuum is present even for
single-mode states. Still, the degree of entanglement is here difficult to
estimate, mainly because there are $N+2$ subsystems, with $N$ unspecified and
large.

qubit and qutrit (three-dimensional) states only. Here, a generalized scissors
device is proposed using an eight-port optical interferometer. Upon
post-selection based on photon counting results, the interferometer implements
generation and teleportation of qudit (d-dimensional) states by truncation of
an input field at the (d-1)th term of its Fock-state expansion up to d=6.
Examples of selective truncations, which can be interpreted as a Fock-state

discussed. Deterioration of the truncation due to imperfect photon counting is
discussed including inefficiency, dark counts and realistic photon-number

producing a critically anomalous dispersion, in a suitable dispersive medium,
which is introduced in the arms of a Sagnac interferometer. We present here an
experimental investigation of the anomalous dispersion properties of
bi-frequency Raman gain in rubidium vapor, with the goal of using this medium
for producing the critically anomalous dispersion condition. A heterodyne phase
measurement technique is used to measure accurately the index variation
associated with the dispersion. The slope of the negative linear dispersion (or
group index) is experimentally varied by more than two orders of magnitude
while changing the frequency separation between pump fields, responsible for
producing gain. Using this result, we have identified the experimental
parameters for achieving a null value of the group index, corresponding to the
critically anomalous dispersion condition necessary for enhanced rotational
sensitivity.

Efficient Qudit Circuits</title><description>  We present an efficient family of quantum circuits for a fundamental
primitive in quantum information theory, the Schur transform. The Schur
transform on n d-dimensional quantum systems is a transform between a standard
computational basis to a labelling related to the representation theory of the
symmetric and unitary groups. If we desire to implement the Schur transform to
an accuracy of epsilon, then our circuit construction uses a number of gates
which is polynomial in n, d and log(1/epsilon). The important insights we use
to perform this construction are the selection of the appropriate subgroup
adapted basis and the Wigner-Eckart theorem. Our efficient circuit construction
renders numerous protocols in quantum information theory computationally
tractable and is an important new efficient quantum circuit family which goes
