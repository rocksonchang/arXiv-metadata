quantization arise from the disparate usage of displacement operators. These
may be the source of a concealed inconsistency in the accepted formalism of
quantum physics. General relativity and related theories cannot be quantized by
the classical procedure. It is necessary to avoid the construction of
differential equations by operators applied algebraically. For such theories,
Von Neumann's theorem concerning hidden variables is avoided. A specified
alternative class of gravitational-quantum-electrodynamic theories is possible.

illustrated through the study of a prototype equation recently proposed for
resonant tunneling of electrons through a double barrier heterostructure and

by a two-state, which is determined by two conditions. Starting with a formal
definition of a two-state Hilbert space and basic operations, we systematically
recast the basics of quantum mechanics - dynamics, observables, and measurement
theory - in terms of two-states as the elementary quantities. We find a simple
and suggestive formulation, that ``unifies'' two complementary observables:
probabilistic observables and non-probabilistic `weak' observables.
Probabilities are relevant for measurements in the `strong coupling regime'.
They are given by the absolute square of a two-amplitude (a projection of a
two-state). Non-probabilistic observables are observed in sufficiently `weak'
measurements, and are given by linear combinations of the two-amplitude. As a
sub-class they include the `weak values' of hermitian operators. We show that
in the intermediate regime, one may observe a mixing of probabilities and weak
values. A consequence of the suggested formalism and measurement theory, is
that the problem of non-locality and Lorentz non-covariance, of the usual
prescription with a `reduction', may be eliminated. We exemplify this point for
the EPR experiment and for a system under successive observations.

if one assumes the condition of locality. Quantum mechanics predicts that this

environment modelled by a fluctuating magnetic field on the quantum
correlations in an EPR singlet as seen in the Bell inequality. We show that in
an EPR setup, the system goes from the usual 'violation' of Bell inequality to
a 'non-violation' for times larger than a characteristic time scale which is
related to the parameters of the fluctuating field. We also look at these
inequalities as a function of the spatial separation between the EPR pair.

measurement process is proposed by considering the interaction of a quantum
system (spin-1/2) with a macroscopic quantum apparatus interacting with an
environment in a dissipative manner. The dissipative interaction leads to
decoherence in the superposition states of the apparatus, making its behaviour
classical in the sense that the density matrix becomes diagonal with time.
Since the apparatus is also interacting with the system, the probabilities of
the diagonal density matrix are determined by the state vector of the system.
We consider a Stern-Gerlach type model, where a spin- 1/2 particle is in an
inhomogeneous magnetic field, the whole set up being in contact with a large
environment. Here we find that the density matrix of the combined system and
apparatus becomes diagonal and the momentum of the particle becomes correlated
with a spin operator, selected by the choice of the system-apparatus
interaction. This allows for a measurement of spin via a momentum measurement
on the particle with associated probabilities in accordance with quantum
principles.

always available. The two-state of $\s$ evolves in time from an initially
`pure' TS to a `mixed' TS and back to a final `pure' TS. This generic process
is governed by a modified Liouville equation, which is derived. For a sub-class
of observables, which can still be described by an ordinary density matrix,
this evolution generates recoherence to a final pure state. In some cases
post-selection can even suppress any decoherence.

predictions due to Aharonov {\it et al.}, and hence describe the outcomes of
real measurements made on subensembles. In particular, this approach is used to
address the question of the history of a particle which has tunnelled across a
barrier. A {\it gedankenexperiment} is presented to demonstrate the physically
testable implications of the results of these calculations, along with graphs
of the time-evolution of the conditional probability distribution for a
tunneling particle and for one undergoing allowed transmission. Numerical
results are also presented for the effects of loss in a bandgap medium on
transmission and on reflection, as a function of the position of the lossy
region; such loss should provide a feasible, though indirect, test of the

This setting is good enough to show contradictions between local hidden

shown here, it is not powerful enough in the case of mixtures. This is
illustrated by an example. In this example, the correlations which arise when
each of two systems separated in space is subjected to a single ideal
measurement are classical; only when each system is subjected to a {\it

also ask whether there are situations for which even this last procedure is not
powerful enough and non-ideal measurements have to be considered as well.

background of a collapsing star requires transplanckian energy fluctuations.
These fluctuations are encoded in the weak values of the energy-momentum
operator constructed from matrix elements between both -in and -out states. It
is argued that taming of these weak values by back-reaction may lead to
geometrical backgrounds which are also build from weak values of the
gravitational field operators. This leads to different causal histories of the
black hole as reconstructed by observers crossing the horizon at different
times but reduces, in accordance with the equivalence principle, to the
classical description of the collapse for the proper history of the star as
recorded by an observer comoving with it. For observers never crossing the
horizon, the evaporation would be interpreted within a topologically trivial
``achronon geometry&quot; void of horizon and singularity: after the initial
ignition of the radiation from pair creation out of the vacuum of the
collapsing star of mass M, as in the conventional theory, the source of the
thermal radiation would shift gradually to the star itself in a time at least
of order $4M\ln 2M$. The burning of the star could be consistent with a quantum
unitary evolution along the lines suggested by 't Hooft. A provisional formal

quantum analogs of systems which exhibit classical hamiltonian chaos entropy
production rate quickly tends to a constant which is given by the sum of the
positive Lyapunov exponents, and falls off only as the system approaches
equilibrium. By contrast, integrable systems tend to have entropy production
rate which decreases as $t^{-1}$ well before equilibrium is attained. Thus,

and for calculations in the technologically important domain lying between the
atomic and classical regimes. Moreover, a correspondence-principle part of the
S-matrix is normally separated out in quantum electrodynamics in order to
obtain a remainder that can be treated perturbatively. But this separation, as
usually performed, causes an apparent breakdown of the correspondence principle
and the associated pole-factorization property. This breakdown is spurious. It
is shown in this article, and a companion, in the context of a special case,
how to extract a distinguished part of the S-matrix that meets the
correspondence-principle and pole-factorization requirements. In a second
companion paper the terms of the remainder are shown to vanish in the
appropriate macroscopic limits. Thus this work validates the correspondence
principle and pole factorization in quantum electrodynamics, in the special
case treated here, and creates a needed computational technique.

cryptographic applications. Instead of the nearly exponential ($\sim \exp
L^{1/3}$, for a number with $L$ digits) time required by the fastest classical
algorithm, the quantum algorithm gives factors in a time polynomial in $L$

computation can simultaneously follow all of the paths corresponding to the

using the quantum state diffusion (QSD) picture of Gisin and Percival, in which
one associates the usual Markovian master equation for the density operator
with a class of stochastic non-linear Schr\&quot;odinger equations. We find
stationary solutions to the Ito equation which are Gaussians, localized around
a point in phase space undergoing classical Brownian motion. We show that every
initial state approaches these stationary solutions in the long time limit. We
recover the density operator corresponding to these solutions, and thus show,
for this particular model, that the QSD picture effectively supplies a
prescription for approximately diagonalizing the density operator in a basis of
phase space localized states. The rate of localization is related to the
decoherence time, and also to the timescale on which thermal and quantum
fluctuations become comparable. We use these results to exemplify the general
connection between the QSD picture and the decoherent histories approach.

  Systems</title><description>  Decoherence in quantum systems which are classically chaotic is studied. The
Arnold cat map and the quantum kicked rotor are chosen as examples of linear
and nonlinear chaotic systems. The Feynman-Vernon influence functional
formalism is used to study the effect of the environment on the system. It is
well-known that quantum coherence can obliterate many chaotic behavior in the
corresponding classical system. But interaction with an environment can under
general circumstances quickly diminish quantum coherence and reenact many
classical chaotic behavior. How effective decoherence works to sustain chaos,
and how the resultant behavior qualitatively differs from the quantum picture
depend on the coupling of the system with the environment and the spectral
density and temperature of the environment. We show how recurrence in the
quantum cat map is lost and classical ergodicity is recovered due to the effect
of the environment. Quantum coherence and diffusion suppression are
instrumental to dynamical localization for the kicked rotor. We show how
environment-induced effects can destroy this localization. Such effects can
also be understood as resulting from external noises driving the system.
Peculiar to decohering chaotic systems is the apparent transition from
reversible to irreversible dynamics. We show such transitions in the quantum
cat map and the kicked rotor and distinguish it from apparent irreversibility
originating from dynamical instability and imprecise measurements. By
performing a time reversal on and followng the quantum kicked rotor dynamics
numerically, we whow how the oth

arbitrarily many bits $n$ (U($2^n$)) can be expressed as compositions of these
gates. We investigate the number of the above gates required to implement other
gates, such as generalized Deutsch-Toffoli gates, that apply a specific U(2)
transformation to one input bit if and only if the logical AND of all remaining
input bits is satisfied. These gates play a central role in many proposed
constructions of quantum computational networks. We derive upper and lower
bounds on the exact number of elementary gates required to build up a variety
of two-and three-bit quantum gates, the asymptotic number required for $n$-bit
Deutsch-Toffoli gates, and make some observations about the number required for
arbitrary $n$-bit unitary operations.

quantum mechanics from classical mechanics and two other basic axioms. In this
first paper, Schreodinger's equation for the density matrix is fist obtained
and from it Schroedinger's equation for the wave functions is derived. The
momentum and position operators acting upon the density matrix are defined and
it is then demonstrated that they commute. Pauli's equation for the density
matrix is also obtained. A statistical potential formally identical to the
quantum potential of Bohm's hidden variable theory is introduced, and this
quantum potential is reinterpreted through the formalism here proposed. It is
shown that, for dispersion free {\it ensembles% }, Schroedinger's equation for
the density matrix is equivalent to Newton's equations. A general non-ambiguous
procedure for the construction of operators which act upon the density matrix
is presented. It is also shown how these operators can be reduced to those
which act upon the wave functions.

A local hidden variable theory is found for non-relativistic quantum mechanics,
which is nothing else than newtonian mechanics itself. We prove that Bell's

  Parabolic Barrier</title><description>  We study the real time dynamics of a quantum system with potential barrier
coupled to a heat-bath environment. Employing the path integral approach an
evolution equation for the time dependent density matrix is derived. The time
evolution is evaluated explicitly near the barrier top in the temperature
region where quantum effects become important. It is shown that there exists a
quasi-stationary state with a constant flux across the potential barrier. This
state generalizes the Kramers flux solution of the classical Fokker-Planck
equation to the quantum regime. In the temperature range explored the quantum
flux state depends only on the parabolic approximation of the anharmonic
barrier potential near the top. The parameter range within which the solution
is valid is investigated in detail. In particular, by matching the flux state
onto the equilibrium state on one side of the barrier we gain a condition on
the minimal damping strength. For very high temperatures this condition reduces
to a known result from classical rate theory. Within the specified parameter
range the decay rate out of a metastable state is calculated from the flux
solution. The rate is shown to coincide with the result of purely thermodynamic
methods. The real time approach presented can be extended to lower temperatures
and smaller damping.

classical perturbations having stochastic Gaussian amplitudes and belonging to
the quasi-isotropic mode. This equivalence and the decoherence are achieved
once the exponentially small (in terms of the squeezing parameter $r_k$)

perturbation mode functions can be made real by a time-independent phase
rotation, this is shown to be equivalent to a fixed relation between squeezing
angle and phase for all modes in the squeezed-state formalism. Though the
present state of the gravitational wave background is not a squeezed quantum
state in the rigid sense and the squeezing parameters loose their direct
meaning due to interaction with the environment and other processes, the
standard predictions for the rms values of the perturbations generated during

  Mechanics</title><description>  The main purpose of the paper is an essentially probabilistic analysis of
relativistic quantum mechanics. It is based on the assumption that whenever
probability distributions arise, there exists a stochastic process that is
either responsible for temporal evolution of a given measure or preserves the
measure in the stationary case. Our departure point is the so-called
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger problem of probabilistic evolution, which provides for a unique
Markov stochastic interpolation between any given pair of boundary probability
densities for a process covering a fixed, finite duration of time, provided we
have decided a priori what kind of primordial dynamical semigroup transition
mechanism is involved. In the nonrelativistic theory, including quantum
mechanics, Feyman-Kac-like kernels are the building blocks for suitable
transition probability densities of the process. In the standard &quot;free&quot; case
(Feynman-Kac potential equal to zero) the familiar Wiener noise is recovered.
In the framework of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger problem, the &quot;free noise&quot; can also be
extended to any infinitely divisible probability law, as covered by the
L\'{e}vy-Khintchine formula. Since the relativistic Hamiltonians $|\nabla |$
and $\sqrt {-\triangle +m^2}-m$ are known to generate such laws, we focus on
them for the analysis of probabilistic phenomena, which are shown to be
associated with the relativistic wave (D'Alembert) and matter-wave
(Klein-Gordon) equations, respectively. We show that such stochastic processes
exist and are spatial jump processes. In general, in the presence of external
potentials, they do not share the Markov property, except for stationary
situations. A concrete example of the pseudodifferential Cauchy-Schr\&quot;{o}dinger
evolution is analyzed in detail. The relativistic covariance of related wave

black hole should have a discrete mass spectrum with concomitant line emission.
Simple arguments fix the spacing of the lines, which should be broad but
unblended. Assuming uniformity of the matrix elements for quantum transitions
between near levels, we work out the probabilities for the emission of a
specified series of quanta and the intensities of the spectral lines. The
thermal character of the radiation is entirely due to the degeneracy of the
levels, the same degeneracy that becomes manifest as black hole entropy. One
prediction is that there should be no lines with wavelength of order the black
hole size or larger. This makes it possible to test quantum gravity with black
holes well above Planck scale.

For the single-well anharmonic oscillator the uniformity of convergence in

values of $g$ lying on a wide domain of the Riemann surface of $E(g)$. Via the
scaling relation \`a la Symanzik, this proves the convergence of delta

convergence of delta expansion are summarized in the form of three theorems,
which should apply to a wide class of quantum mechanical and higher dimensional

involved in standard non-relativistic quantum mechanics, with the help of
analogies from classical physics. A classical or quantum description of a
mechanical system involves a {\it framework}, often chosen implicitly, and a
{\it statement} or assertion about the system which is either true or false
within the framework with which it is associated. Quantum descriptions are no
less ``objective'' than their classical counterparts, but differ from the
latter in the following respects: (i) The framework employs a Hilbert space
rather than a classical phase space. (ii) The rules for constructing meaningful
statements require that the associated projectors commute with each other and,
in the case of time-dependent quantum histories, that consistency conditions be
satisfied. (iii) There are incompatible frameworks which cannot be combined,
either in constructing descriptions or in making logical inferences about them,
even though any one of these frameworks may be used separately for describing a
particular physical system.
  A new type of ``generalized history'' is introduced which extends previous
proposals by Omn\`es, and Gell-Mann and Hartle, and a corresponding consistency
condition which does not involve density matrices or single out a direction of
time. Applications which illustrate the formalism include: measurements of
spin, two-slit diffraction, and the emergence of the classical world from a
fully quantum description.

Indeterministic quantum gravity is a theory that unifies general relativity and
quantum theory involving indeterministic conception, i.e., quantum jumps. By
the same token the theory claims to describe all the universe.
 Spacetime is the direct product of cosmic time and space. The state of the
universe is given by metric, its derivative with respect to cosmic time, and
the number of an energy level. A quantum jump occurs at the tangency of two
levels. Equations of motion are the restricted Einstein equation (the cosmic
space part thereof) and a probability rule for the quantum jump.

processes such as learning and memory, by possessing a well-known binary
error-correcting code with 64 words. In fact, MTs and DNA/RNA are unique cell
structures that possess a code system. It seems that the MTs' code system is
strongly related to a kind of ``Mental Code&quot; in the following sense. The MTs'
periodic paracrystalline structure make them able to support a superposition of
coherent quantum states, as it has been recently conjectured by Hameroff and
Penrose, representing an external or mental order, for sufficient time needed
for efficient quantum computing. Then the quantum superposition collapses
spontaneously/dynamically through a new, string-derived mechanism for collapse
proposed recently by Ellis, Mavromatos, and myself. At the moment of collapse,
organized quantum exocytosis occurs, and this is how a ``{\em mental order}&quot;

physics is local and deterministic, is challenged. A parametrised model, Q, for
the state vector evolution of spin 1/2 particles during measurement is
developed. Q draws on recent work on so-called riddled basins in dynamical
systems theory, and is local, deterministic, nonlinear and time asymmetric.
Moreover the evolution of the state vector to one of two chaotic attractors
(taken to represent observed spin states) is effectively uncomputable.
Motivation for this model arises from Penrose's speculations about the nature
and role of quantum gravity. Although the evolution of Q's state vector is
uncomputable, the probability that the system will evolve to one of the two
attractors is computable. These probabilities correspond quantitatively to the
statistics of spin 1/2 particles. In an ensemble sense the evolution of the
state vector towards an attractor can be described by a diffusive random walk.
Bell's theorem and a version of the Bell-Kochen_specker quantum entanglement
paradox are discussed. It is shown that proving an inconsistency with locality
demands the existence of definite truth values to certain counterfactual
propositions. In Q these deterministic propositions are physically uncomputable
and no non-algorithmic solution is either known or suspected. Adapting the
mathematical formalist approach, the non-existence of definite truth values to
such counterfactual propositions is posited. No inconsistency with experiment
is found. Hence Q is not necessarily constrained by Bell's inequality.

sensitive to reveal nonlocal correlations between distant parts of composite
quantum systems. The outcome statistics of joint nonideal measurements on local

the density operator of a local composite system must be convex mixture of the

complementary descriptions for motions in space-time. In particular, quantum
fields exert a radiation pressure on scatterers which results in mechanical
effects that persist in vacuum. They include mean forces due to quantum field
fluctuations, like Casimir forces, but also fluctuations of these forces and
additional forces linked to motion. As in classical electron theory, a moving
scatterer is submitted to a radiation reaction force which modifies its
motional response to an applied force. We briefly survey the mechanical effects
of quantum field fluctuations and discuss the consequences for stability of
motion in vacuum and for position fluctuations.

effects on scatterers. The question naturally arises whether the energy of
vacuum fluctuations gives rise to inertia and gravitation in agreement with the
general principles of mechanics. As a new approach to this question, we discuss
the mechanical effects of quantum field fluctuations on two mirrors building a
Fabry-Perot cavity. We first put into evidence that the energy related to
Casimir forces is an energy stored on field fluctuations as a result of
scattering time delays. We then discuss the forces felt by the mirrors when
they move within vacuum field fluctuations, and show that energy stored on
vacuum fluctuations contributes to inertia in conformity with the law of
inertia of energy. As a further consequence, inertial masses exhibit quantum
fluctuations with characteristic spectra in vacuum.

probing. Although using optimised probe fields can allow to push sensitivity in
a position measurement beyond the &quot;standard quantum limit&quot;, quantum
fluctuations of the probe field still result in limitations which are
determined by irreducible dissipation mechanisms. Fluctuation-dissipation
relations in vacuum characterise the mechanical effects of radiation pressure
vacuum fluctuations, which lead to an ultimate quantum noise for positions. For
macroscopic reflectors, the quantum noise on positions is dominated by
gravitational vacuum fluctuations, and takes a universal form deduced from
quantum fluctuations of space-time curvatures in vacuum. These can be
considered as ultimate space-time fluctuations, fixing ultimate quantum limits
in space-time measurements.

  Hydrogen and Alkali-Metal Atoms</title><description>  This paper begins with an examination of the revival structure and long-term
evolution of Rydberg wave packets for hydrogen. We show that after the initial
cycle of collapse and fractional/full revivals, which occurs on the time scale
$t_{\rm rev}$, a new sequence of revivals begins. We find that the structure of
the new revivals is different from that of the fractional revivals. The new
revivals are characterized by periodicities in the motion of the wave packet
with periods that are fractions of the revival time scale $t_{\rm rev}$. These
long-term periodicities result in the autocorrelation function at times greater
than $t_{\rm rev}$ having a self-similar resemblance to its structure for times
less than $t_{\rm rev}$. The new sequence of revivals culminates with the
formation of a single wave packet that more closely resembles the initial wave
packet than does the full revival at time $t_{\rm rev}$, i.e., a superrevival
forms. Explicit examples of the superrevival structure for both circular and
radial wave packets are given. We then study wave packets in alkali-metal
atoms, which are typically used in experiments. The behavior of these packets
is affected by the presence of quantum defects that modify the hydrogenic
revival time scales and periodicities. Their behavior can be treated
analytically using supersymmetry-based quantum-defect theory. We illustrate our
results for alkali-metal atoms with explicit examples of the revival structure
for radial wave packets in rubidium.

that it contains nothing probabilistic, except, in a certain frequency sense,
conscious perceptions. Sets of these perceptions can be deterministically
realized with measures given by expectation values of positive-operator-valued
awareness operators in a quantum state of the universe which never jumps or
collapses. Ratios of the measures for these sets of perceptions can be
interpreted as frequency-type probabilities for many actually existing sets
rather than as propensities for potentialities to be actualized, so there is
nothing indeterministic in SQM. These frequency-type probabilities generally
cannot be given by the ordinary quantum &quot;probabilities&quot; for a single set of
alternatives. Probabilism, or ascribing probabilities to unconscious aspects of
the world, may be seen to be an aesthemamorphic myth.
  No fundamental correlation or equivalence is postulated between different
perceptions (each being the entirety of a single conscious experience and thus
not in direct contact with any other), so SQM, a variant of Everett's
&quot;many-worlds&quot; framework, is a &quot;many-perceptions&quot; framework but not a
&quot;many-minds&quot; framework. Different detailed SQM theories may be tested against
experienced perceptions by the typicalities (defined herein) they predict for
these perceptions. One may adopt the Conditional Aesthemic Principle: among the
set of all conscious perceptions, our perceptions are likely to be typical.
  An experimental test is proposed to compare SQM with a variant, SQMn.

interfaces between media of different polarizability. In a stationary
dielectric the zero-point fluctuations of the electromagnetic field excite
virtual two-photon states which become real under perturbation due to motion of
the dielectric. The sonoluminescent bubble is modelled as an optically empty
cavity in a homogeneous dielectric. The problem of the photon emission by a
cavity of time-dependent radius is handled in a Hamiltonian formalism which is
dealt with perturbatively up to first order in the velocity of the bubble
surface over the speed of light. A parameter-dependence of the zero-order
Hamiltonian in addition to the first-order perturbation calls for a new
perturbative method combining standard perturbation theory with an adiabatic
approximation. In this way the transition amplitude from the vacuum into a
two-photon state is obtained, and expressions for the single-photon spectrum
and the total energy radiated during one flash are given both in full and in
the short-wavelengths approximation when the bubble is larger than the
wavelengths of the emitted light. It is shown analytically that the spectral
density has the same frequency-dependence as black-body radiation; this is
purely an effect of correlated quantum fluctuations at zero temperature. The
present theory clarifies a number of hitherto unsolved problems and suggests
explanations for several more. Possible experiments that discriminate this from
other theories of sonoluminescence are proposed.

the master equation into another phase space projector onto the classical
dissipative evolution of $\Gamma$, and with a certain amount of degradation due
to the noise produced by the environment. We thus show that histories of phase

over density operator computations. Quantum state diffusion with a moving basis
(MQSD) provides a practical numerical simulation method which takes full
advantage of the localization of quantum states into wave packets occupying
small regions of classical phase space. Following and extending the original
proposal of Percival, Alber and Steimle, we show that MQSD can provide a
further gain over ordinary QSD and other quantum trajectory methods of many
orders of magnitude in computational space and time. Because of these gains, it
is even possible to calculate an open quantum system trajectory when the
corresponding isolated system is intractable. MQSD is particularly advantageous
where classical or semiclassical dynamics provides an adequate qualitative
picture but is numerically inaccurate because of significant quantum effects.
The principles are illustrated by computations for the quantum Duffing
oscillator and for second harmonic generation in quantum optics. Potential
applications in atomic and molecular dynamics, quantum circuits and quantum
computation are suggested.

does not support objective indeterminism, since the statistical laws of
classical physics allow a deterministic hidden background, while --- as Arthur
Fine writes polemizing with Gr\&quot;unbaum --- &quot;{\sl the antilibertarian position
finds little room to breathe in a statistical world if we take laws of the
quantum theory as exemplars of the statistical laws in such a world. So, it
appears that, contrary to what Gr\&quot;unbaum claims, the libertarians' 'could have
done otherwise' does indeed find support from indeterminism if we take the
indeterministic laws to be of the sort found in the quantum theory.}&quot; In this
paper I will show that, quite the contrary, quantum mechanics does not save
free will. For instance, the EPR experiments are compatible with a
deterministic world. They admit a deterministic local hidden parameter
description if the deterministic model is 'allowed' to describe not only the
measurement outcomes, but also the outcomes of the 'decisions' whether this or
that measurement will be performed. So, the derivation of the freedom of the
will from quantum mechanics is a tautology: from the assumption that the world
is indeterministic it is derived that the world cannot be deterministic.

the quantum billiard. This paper is an extensive numerical survey of BIM in a
variety of quantum billiards, integrable (circle, rectangle), KAM systems
(Robnik billiard) and fully chaotic (ergodic, such as stadium, Sinai billiard
and cardioid billiard). On the theoretical side we point out some serious flaws
in the derivation of BIM in the literature and show how the final formula
(which nevertheless was correct) should be derived in a sound way and we also
argue that a simple minded application of BIM in nonconvex geometries presents
serious difficulties or even fails. On the numerical side we have analyzed the
scaling of the averaged absolute value of the systematic error $\Delta E$ of
the eigenenergy in units of mean level spacing with the density of
discretization ($b$ = number of numerical nodes on the boundary within one de
Broglie wavelength), and we find that in all cases the error obeys a power law
$ &lt;|\Delta E|&gt; = A b^{-\alpha}$, where $ \alpha $ (and also $A$) varies from
case to case (it is not universal), and is affected strongly by the existence
of exterior chords in nonconvex geometries, whereas the degree of the classical
chaos seems to be practically irrelevant. We comment on the semiclassical limit
of BIM and make suggestions about a proper formulation with correct
semiclassical limit in nonconvex geometries.

  invariance</title><description>  The quantum-mechanical framework in which observables are associated with
Hermitian operators is too narrow to discuss measurements of such important
physical quantities as elapsed time or harmonic-oscillator phase. We introduce
a broader framework that allows us to derive quantum-mechanical limits on the
precision to which a parameter---e.g., elapsed time---may be determined via
arbitrary data analysis of arbitrary measurements on $N$ identically prepared
quantum systems. The limits are expressed as generalized Mandelstam-Tamm
uncertainty relations, which involve the operator that generates displacements
of the parameter---e.g., the Hamiltonian operator in the case of elapsed time.
This approach avoids entirely the problem of associating a Hermitian operator
with the parameter. We illustrate the general formalism, first, with
nonrelativistic uncertainty relations for spatial displacement and momentum,
harmonic-oscillator phase and number of quanta, and time and energy and,
second, with Lorentz-invariant uncertainty relations involving the displacement
and Lorentz-rotation parameters of the Poincar\'e group.

nothing indeterministic in SQM. These frequency-type probabilities generally

equations of general relativity to construct a Robertson-Walker metric for a
quantum particle so that the line element of the particle can be transformed
entirely to that of the Minkowski spacetime, which is assumed by a quantum
observer, and the spacetime dynamics of the particle described by a Minkowski
observer takes the form of quantum mechanics. Spacetime structure of a quantum
particle may have either positive or negative curvature. However, in order to
be describable using the familiar framework of quantum mechanics, the spacetime
structure of a quantum particle must be &quot;quantised&quot; by an introduction of the
imaginary number $i$. If a particle has a positive curvature then the
quantisation is equivalent to turning the pseudo-Riemannian spacetime of the
particle into a Riemannian spacetime. This means that it is assumed the
particle is capable of measuring its temporal distance like its spatial
distances. On the other hand, when a particle has a negative curvature and a
negative energy density then quantising the spacetime structure of the particle
is equivalent to viewing the particle as if it had a positive curvature and a
positive energy density.

Mechanics or BM) [1-10] is an augmentation of ``bare'' quantum mechanics (the
bare theory being given by an algebra of operators and a quantum state that
sets the expectation values of these operators) that includes a definite
history or Bohmian trajectory. This definite trajectory gives BM a somewhat
more classical flavor than most other forms of quantum mechanics (QM) (though
the trajectory certainly has highly nonlocal and other nonclassical aspects in
its evolution), but to see whether or not this makes a difference for
observations by conscious beings, one needs to attach theories of conscious
perceptions to BM and other forms of QM. Here I shall propose various forms of
theories of consciousness for BM, which I shall call {\it Sensible Bohmian

consciousness attached to bare QM, which I call {\it Sensible Quantum

give essentially similar predictions as SQM, though a wider class might be in
practice indistinguishable to any single observer. I also remain sceptical that
a viable complete form of SBM will turn out to be as simple a description of
the universe as a viable complete form of SQM, but of course it is too early to
know yet what the form of the simplest complete theory of our universe is.

  Mechanics</title><description>  We prove that, for a quantum system that undergoes a strong perturbation, the
solution of the leading order equation of the strong field approximation
(M.Frasca, Phys. Rev. A, {\bf 45}, 43 (1992)) can be derived by the adiabatic
approximation. In fact, it is shown that greatest is the perturbation and more
similar the quantum system is to an adiabatic one, the solution being written
as a superposition of eigenstates of the time-dependent perturbation.A direct
consequence of this result is that the solution of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation
in the interaction picture, in the same approximation for the perturbation,
coincides with the one of the leading order of the strong field approximation.
The limitation due to the requirement that the perturbation has to commute at
different times is so overcome. Computational difficulties could arise to go to
higher orders. Beside, the method is not useful for perturbations that are
constant in time. In such a case a small time series is obtained, indicating
that this approximation is just an application to quantum mechanics of the
Kirkwood-Wigner expansion of statistical mechanics. The theory obtained in this
way is applied to a time-dependent two-level spin model, already considered for
the study of the Berry's phase, showing that a geometrical phase could arise if
a part of the hamiltonian is considered as a strong perturbation. No adiabatic
approximation is taken on the parameters of the hamiltonian, while their
cyclicity is retained.

used to describe a nonabelian gauge theory. Predictions are made for certain
alternatives, with particular attention given to coarse-grainings involving the
constraint. In this way, the theory is compared to other quantum-mechanical
descriptions of gauge theories in which the constraints are imposed by hand.
The vanishing of the momentum space constraint is seen to hold, both through a
simple formal argument and via a more careful description of the Lorentzian
path integral as defined on a spacetime lattice. (Incidentally, the treatment
of the time slicing in the path integral may be of general technical interest.)
The configuration space realization of the constraint is shown to behave in a
more complicated fashion. For some coarse grainings, we recover the known
result from an abelian theory, that coarse grainings by values of the
constraint either predict its vanishing or fail to decohere. However, sets of
alternatives defined in terms of a more complicated quantity in the abelian
case are exhibited where definite predictions can be made which disagree with
the assumption that the constraints vanish. Finally, the configuration space
sum-over-histories theory is exhibited in a manifestly Lorentz-invariant
formulation.

interpret |S| as a &quot;propensity&quot;, making this precise by stating a criterion for
|S|=0 to imply &quot;preclusion&quot; (meaning that the true history will not lie in S).
The criterion involves triads of correlated events, and in application to
electron-electron scattering, for example, it yields definite predictions about
the electron trajectories themselves, independently of any measuring devices
which might or might not be present. (So we can give an objective account of
measurements.) Two unfinished aspects of the interpretation involve
*conditonal* preclusion (which apparently requires a notion of coarse-graining
for its formulation) and the need to &quot;locate spacetime regions in advance&quot;
without the aid of a fixed background metric (which can be achieved in the

strong lower bounds on the approximation capabilities of g-qubit unitary

and functions by quantum circuits, almost all states and functions are
exponentially hard to approximate [Knill 1995]. The bounds obtained are
asymptotically tight except for the one based on total variation distance
(TVD). TVD is the most relevant metric for the performance of a quantum
circuit. In this paper we obtain asymptotically tight bounds for TVD. We show
that in a natural sense, almost all states are hard to approximate to within a
TVD of 2/e-\epsilon even for exponentially small \epsilon. The quantity 2/e is
asymptotically the average distance to the uniform distribution. Almost all
states with probability amplitudes concentrated in a small fraction of the
space are hard to approximate to within a TVD of 2-\epsilon. These results
imply that non-uniform quantum circuit complexity is non-trivial in any
reasonable model. They also reinforce the notion that the relative information
distance between states (which is based on the difficulty of transforming one
state to another) fully reflects the dimensionality of the space of qubits, not
the number of qubits.

$i\eps d\psi(t)/dt=H(t)\psi(t)$ is considered, where the analytic generator
$H(t)\in M_n(\C)$ is such that its spectrum is real and non-degenerate for all
$t\in\R$. Sufficient conditions allowing to compute asymptotic formulas for the
exponentially small off-diagonal elements of the $S$-matrix as $\eps\ra 0$ are
explicited and a wide class of generators for which these conditions are

spectrum exhibits eigenvalue crossings which are perturbed in such a way that
these crossings turn to avoided crossings. The exponentially small asymptotic

together with superasymptotic renormalization. The application of these results
to the study of quantum adiabatic transitions in the time dependent

insight into the general wave packet behavior and demonstrates agreement with
conventional theory. We then obtain an alternative analytical description of a
radial wave packet as a member of a particular family of squeezed states, which
we call radial squeezed states. By construction, these have close to minimum
uncertainty in the radial coordinates during the first pass through the outer
apsidal point. The properties of radial squeezed states are investigated, and
they are shown to provide a description of certain aspects of Rydberg atoms
excited by short-pulsed laser fields. We derive expressions for the time

adiabatically. This is accomplished by deriving the unitary operator of
adiabatic evolution for the leading order. In this way it is possible to show
that at least one of the causes of the problem of phase-mixing, whose effect
is the polynomial increase in time of the perturbation terms normally called
secularities, arises from the shifts of the perturbation energy levels due to
the unperturbed part of the hamiltonian. An example is given for a two-level

Global decomposition theorems, interesting subgroups and their generators are

over from a single postulate on the common nature of matter and stationary
forms of radiation quanta. Basic relativistic, gravitational (G) and quantum
mechanical properties of a standing wave particle model have been derived. This
has been done from just dual properties of radiation's and strictly homogeneous
relationships for nonlocal cases in G fields. This way reduces the number of
independent variables and puts into relief (and avoid) important inhomogeneity
errors of some G theories. It unifies and accounts for basic principles and
postulates physics. The results for gravity depend on linear radiation
properties but not on arbitrary field relations. They agree with the
conventional tests. However they have some fundamental differences with current
G theories. The particle model, at a difference of the conventional theories,
also fixes well-defined cosmological and astrophysical models that are
different from the rather conventional ones. They have been described and
tested with the astronomical observations. These tests have been resumed in a
separated work to be sent to the astro Archive.

implementation of parametrized non-relativistic quantum mechanics (PNRQM). The
wide range of time functions that are available to define evolving constants
raises issues of interpretation, consistency, and the degree to which the
resulting quantum theory coincides with, or generalizes, the usual
non-relativistic theory. The allowed time functions must be restricted for the
predictions of PNRQM to coincide with those of usual quantum theory. They must
be restricted to have a notion of quantum evolution in a time-parameter
connected to spacetime geometry. They must be restricted to prevent the theory
from making inconsistent predictions for the probabilities of histories.
Suitable restrictions can be introduced in PNRQM but these seem unlikely to
apply to a reparametrization invariant theory like general relativity.

quantum state diffusion theory, many systems localize to wave packets in the
neighborhood of phase space points. This is due to decoherence from the
interaction with the environment, and makes the quasiclassical limit of such
systems both more realistic and simpler in many respects than the more familiar
quasiclassical limit for closed systems. A linearized version of this theory
leads to the correct classical dynamics in the macroscopic limit, even for
nonlinear and chaotic systems. We apply the theory to the forced, damped
Duffing oscillator, comparing the numerical results of the full and linearized
equations, and argue that this can be used to make explicit calculations in the
decoherent histories formalism of quantum mechanics.

histories of a closed quantum-mechanical system such as the universe. The
condition applies, for a pure initial state, to sets of homogeneous histories
that are chains of projections, generally branch-dependent. Strong decoherence
implies the consistency of probability sum rules but not every set of
consistent or even medium decoherent histories is strongly decoherent. Two
conditions characterize a strongly decoherent set of histories: (1) At any time
the operators that effectively commute with generalized records of history up
to that moment provide the pool from which -- with suitable adjustment for
elapsed time -- the chains of projections extending history to the future may
be drawn. (2) Under the adjustment process, generalized record operators acting
on the initial state of the universe are approximately unchanged. This
expresses the permanence of generalized records. The strong decoherence
conditions (1) and (2) guarantee what we call ``permanence of the past'' -- in
particular the continued decoherence of past alternatives as the chains of
projections are extended into the future. Strong decoherence is an idealization
capturing in a general way this and other aspects of realistic physical
mechanisms that destroy interference, as we illustrate in a simple model. We
discuss the connection between the reduced density matrices that have often
been used to characterize mechanisms of decoherence and the more general notion
of strong decoherence. The relation between strong decoherence and a measure of
classicality is briefly described.

We study the
so-called quantum Zeno effect, that arises from the quadratic short-time
behavior, and the analytic properties of the ``survival&quot; amplitude. It is shown
that the exponential behavior is due to the presence of a simple pole in the
second Riemannian sheet, while the contribution of the branch point yields a
power behavior for the amplitude. The exponential decay form is cancelled at
short times and dominated at very long times by the branch-point contributions,
which give a Gaussian behavior for the former and a power behavior for the
latter. In order to realize the exponential law in quantum theory, it is
essential to take into account a certain kind of macroscopic nature of the
total system. Some attempts at extracting the exponential decay law from
quantum theory, aiming at the master equation, are briefly reviewed, including
van Hove's pioneering work and his well-known ``$\lambda^2T$&quot; limit. We clarify
these general arguments by introducing and studying a solvable dynamical model.
Some implications for the quantum measurement problem are also discussed, in
particular in connection with dissipation.

``dynamical Casimir effect'' might provide the driving force behind the
puzzling phenomenon of sonoluminescence. Motivated by that exciting suggestion,
I have computed the static Casimir energy of a spherical cavity in an otherwise
uniform material with dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and permeability $\mu$. As
expected the result is divergent; yet a plausible finite answer is extracted,
in the leading uniform asymptotic approximation. That result gives far too
small an energy to account for the large burst of photons seen in
sonoluminescence. If the divergent result is retained (which is different from
that guessed by Schwinger), it is of the wrong sign to drive the effect.
Dispersion does not resolve this contradiction. However, dynamical effects are

classical dynamical chaos under the ordinary semiclassical transition, which
extends the correspondence principle to chaotic systems. In return one should
accept the modified form of quantum formalism (presented by the Schroedinger
equation) which, however, does not contradict the ordinary form and the main
postulates of quantum mechanics. It introduces the principle of the fundamental
dynamic multivaluedness (redundance) extending the quantum paradigm to complex
dynamical behaviour. Moreover, a causal solution to the well-known problems of
the foundation of quantum mechanics, those of quantum indeterminacy and wave
reduction, is also found using the same method. The concept of the fundamental
dynamic uncertainty thus established is universal in character and provides a
unified scheme of the complete description of arbitrary complex system of any
origin (physics/9806002). This scheme incorporates, in particular, universal
definitions of complexity, (non)integrability, and general solution, as well as
the physically complete notion of probability. One obtains thus a

the effects of vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction separately. We show
that radiation reaction is generally not altered by stationary acceleration,
whereas the contribution of vacuum fluctuations differs for all stationary
accelerated trajectories from its inertial value. Spontaneous excitation from
the ground state occurs for all { accelerated stationary} trajectories and is
therefore the ``normal case''. We furthermore show that the radiative energy

Our results are illustrated for the special case of an atom in circular motion,

(i) in the classical limit this distribution is canonical, (ii) for macroscopic
systems, the mean values of energy for adiabatic and zero-polytropic processes
are the same, but its fluctuations are different, and (iii) in general,
adiabatic and zero-polytropic processes are different, which is particularly

existence of states that have localised position while being eigenstates of
energy and momentum. These states are applicable to all varieties of physical
bodies, including planets and stars in free motion in the universe. The states
are compound entanglements of multiple free bodies in which the momenta of the
bodies are anticorrelated so that they always sum to zero, while their total
kinetic energy is anticorrelated with their internal energies, so the total is
a constant, E. The bodies are relatively localised while the total state has
well-defined energy and momentum. These states do not violate Heisenberg
uncertainty because the total centre of mass is not localised, hence the states
naturally describe whole universes rather than isolated systems within a
universe. A further property of these states, resulting from the form of the
entanglement, is that they display nonlocality in the full sense of signal
transmission rather than the more restricted Bell sense.

The first is a dynamical process governed by the equations of local quantum

structure that is not compatible with observed reality. A second process is
therefore invoked. This second process somehow analyzes the structure generated
by the first process into a collection of possible observable realities, and
selects one of these as the actually appearing reality. This selection process
is not well understood. It is necessarily nonlocal and, according to orthodox
thinking, is governed by an irreducible element of chance. The occurrence of
this irreducible element of chance means that the theory is not naturalistic:
the dynamics is controlled in part by something that is not part of the
physical universe. The present work describes a quantum mechanical model of
brain dynamics in which the quantum selection process is a causal process
governed not by pure chance but rather by a mathematically specified nonlocal
physical process identifiable as the conscious process.

  multivaluedness</title><description>  Two major deviations from causality in the existing formulations of quantum
mechanics, related respectively to quantum chaos and indeterminate wave
reduction, are eliminated within the new, universal concept of dynamic
complexity. The analysis involves a new paradigm for description of a system
with interaction, the principle of dynamic multivaluedness (redundance), and
the ensuing concept of the fundamental dynamic uncertainty. It is shown that
both the wave reduction and truly unpredictable (chaotic) behaviour in quantum
systems can be completely and causally understood as a higher sublevel of the
same dynamic complexity that provides the causally complete picture of the
unified wave-particle duality and relativity at its lowest level
(quant-ph/9902015,16). The presentation is divided into five parts. The first
three parts deal with intrinsic randomness in Hamiltonian (isolated) quantum
systems as the basic case of dynamical chaos. In the last two parts a causal
solution to the problem of quantum indeterminacy and wave reduction is
proposed. Part I introduces the method of effective dynamical functions as a
generalisation of the optical potential formalism. The method provides a legal
transformation of the Schroedinger equation revealing the hidden
multivaluedness of interaction process, i. e. its self-consistent, dynamical
splitting into many equally real, but mutually incompatible branches, called
'realisations'. Each realisation incorporates the usual &quot;complete&quot; set of
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues for the entire problem. The method is presented
in detail for the Hamiltonian system with periodic (not small) perturbation,
both in its time-independent and time-dependent versions.

  uncertainty in quantum systems and the correspondence principle</title><description>  The intrinsic multivaluedness of interaction process, revealed in Part I of
this series of papers, is interpreted as the origin of the true dynamical (in
particular, quantum) chaos. The latter is causally deduced as unceasing series
of transitions, dynamically probabilistic by their origin, between the equally
real, but incompatible 'realisations' (modes of interaction) of a system. The
obtained set of realisations form the causally derived, intrinsically complete
&quot;space of events&quot; providing the crucial extension of the notion of probability
and the method of its first-principle calculation. The fundamental dynamic
uncertainty thus revealed is specified for Hamiltonian quantum systems and
applied to quantum chaos description in periodically perturbed systems. The
ordinary semiclassical transition in our quantum-mechanical results leads to
exact reproduction of the main features of chaotic behaviour of the system
known from classical mechanics, which permits one to &quot;re-establish&quot; the
correspondence principle for chaotic systems (inevitably lost in any their
conventional, single-valued description). The causal dynamical randomness in
the extended quantum mechanics is not restricted, however, to semiclassical
conditions and generically occurs also in essentially quantum regimes, even
though partial &quot;quantum suppression of chaos&quot; does exist and is specified in
our description, as well as other particular types of the quantum (truly)
chaotic behaviour.

  structure of complexity</title><description>  The universal dynamic uncertainty, discovered in Parts I and II of this
series of papers for the case of Hamiltonian quantum systems, is further
specified to reveal the hierarchical structure of levels of dynamically
redundant 'realisations' which takes the form of the intrinsically
probabilistic 'fundamental dynamical fractal' of a problem and determines
fractal character of the observed quantities. This intrinsic fractality is
obtained as a natural, causally derived property of dynamic behaviour of a
system with interaction and the corresponding complete solution. Every branch
of the fundamental dynamical fractal of a problem, as well as the probability
of its emergence, can be obtained within the extended nonperturbative analysis
of the main dynamic equation (Schroedinger equation in our case), contrary to
basically restricted imitations of fractality within the canonical,
single-valued approach. The results of the dynamical chaos analysis in
Hamiltonian quantum systems, Parts I-III, are then subjected to discussion and
generalisation. The physical origins of the dynamic uncertainty are analysed
from various points of view. The basic consequences, involving essential
extension of the conventional, unitary (= single-valued) quantum mechanics, are
summarised. Finally, we emphasize the universal character of the emerging
notions of dynamic multivaluedness (or redundance), causal randomness (or
dynamic uncertainty), first-principle probability, (non)integrability, general
solution, and physical complexity applicable to real dynamical systems of any
kind.

  of quantum indeterminacy and wave reduction</title><description>  The concept of fundamental dynamic uncertainty (multivaluedness) developed in
Parts I-III of this work and used to establish the consistent understanding of
genuine chaos in Hamiltonian systems provides also causal description of the
quantum measurement process. The modified Schroedinger formalism involving
multivalued effective dynamical functions reveals the dynamic origin of quantum
measurement indeterminacy as the intrinsic instability in the compound system
of 'measured object' and (dissipative) 'instrument' with respect to splitting
into spatially localised 'realisations'. As a result, the originally wide
measured wave catastrophically (and really!) &quot;shrinks&quot; around a random
accessible point thus losing all its 'nonlocal properties' with respect to
other points/realisations. The dissipativity of one of the interacting objects
(serving as 'instrument') is reduced to its (arbitrarily small) openness
towards other systems (levels of complexity) and determines the difference
between quantum measurement and quantum chaos, the latter corresponding to an
effectively isolated system of interacting (micro-) objects. We do not use any
assumptions on particular &quot;classical&quot;, &quot;macroscopic&quot;, &quot;stochastic&quot;, etc. nature
of the instrument or environment: physical reduction and indeterminacy
dynamically appear already in interaction between two microscopic (quantum)
deterministic systems, the object and the instrument, possessing just a few
degrees of freedom a part of which, belonging to the instrument, should
correspond to locally starting, arbitrarily weak excitation. This dynamically
indeterminate wave reduction occurs in agreement with the postulates of the
conventional quantum mechanics, including the rule of probabilities, which
transforms them into consequences of the dynamic uncertainty.

  mechanics</title><description>  The physical consequences of the analysis performed in Parts I-IV are
outlined within a scheme of the complete quantum (wave) mechanics called
quantum field mechanics and completing the original ideas of Louis de Broglie
by the dynamic complexity concept. The total picture includes the formally
complete description at the level of the &quot;average&quot; wave function of
Schroedinger type that shows dynamically chaotic behaviour in the form of
either quantum chaos (Parts I-III), or quantum measurement (Part IV) with
causal indeterminacy and wave reduction. This level is only an approximation,
though often sufficient, to a lower (and actually the lowest accessible) level
of complexity containing the causally complete version of the unreduced,
nonlinear &quot;double solution&quot; proposed by Louis de Broglie. The extended 'double
solution with chaos' describes the state of a nonlinear material field and
includes the unstable high-intensity &quot;hump&quot; moving chaotically within the
embedding smooth wave (quant-ph/9902015,16). The involvement of chaos causally
understood within the same concept of dynamic complexity (multivaluedness)
provides, at this lower level, de Broglie's &quot;hidden thermodynamics&quot; now,
however, without the necessity for any real &quot;hidden thermostat&quot;. The chaotic
reduction of the &quot;piloting&quot; Schroedinger wave, at the higher sublevel of
complexity, conforms with the detailed 'wandering' of the virtual soliton at
the lower sublevel. The proposed dynamic multivaluedness (redundance) paradigm
serves as the basis for a self-consistent hierarchic picture of the world with
a (high) non-zero complexity (and thus irreducible randomness), where the
complete extension of quantum mechanics is causally interpreted as several
lowest levels of complexity.

generalized atomic shells. These shells are ordered according to a generalized
Madelung rule in $D$ dimensions. This rule together with an {\it Aufbau
Prinzip} is applied to produce a $D$-dimensional periodic table. A model is
developed to rationalize the ordering of the shells predicted by the
generalized Madelung rule. This model is based on the introduction of an
Hamiltonian, invariant under the $q$-deformed algebra $U_q($so$(D))$, that
breaks down the SO($D+1$) dynamical symmetry of the hydrogen atom in $D$
dimensions. The $D=2$ case (Flatland) is investigated with some details. It is
shown that the neutral atoms and the (moderately) positive ions correspond to
the values $q=0.8$ and $q=1$, respectively, of the deformation parameter $q$.

of $N^{-1/2}$ for the function of N arguments which is a solution to the Cauchy
problem for the equation of a special type. Many-particle Wigner,
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger and Liouville equations for a system of a large number of
particles are of this type, when the external potential is of order O(1), while
the coefficient of the particle interaction potential is 1/N; the potentials
can be arbitrary smooth bounded functions. We apply this method to equations
for N-particle states corresponding to the N-th tensor power of an abstract
Hamiltonian algebra of observables. In particular, we show for the case of
multiparticle Schr\&quot;{o}dinger-like equations that the property of N-particle
wave function to be approximately equal at large N to the product of
one-particle wave functions does not conserve under time evolution, while the
same property for the correlation functions of the finite order is known to
conserve(such hypothesis being the quantum analog of the chaos conservation
hypothesis put forward by M.Kac in 1956 was proved by the analysis of the
BBGKY-like hierarchy of equations). In order to find a leading asymptotics for
the N-particle wave function, one should use not only the solution to the well-
known Hartree equation being derivable from the BBGKY approach but also the
solution to another (Riccati-type) equation presented in this paper. We also
consider another interesting case when one adds to the N-particle system under
consideration one more particle interacting with the system with the
coefficient of the interaction potential of order O(1).It happens that in this
case one should investigate not a single Hartree-like equation but a set of
such equations, and the chaos will not conserve even for the correlators.

evolution of the state of a system under rapidly repeated measurements, and
ultimately a freezing of the state. To test this so-called quantum Zeno effect
an experiment was performed by Itano et al. (Phys. Rev. A 41, 2295 (1990)) in
which an atomic-level measurement was realized by means of a short laser pulse.
The relevance of the results has given rise to controversies in the literature.
In particular the projection postulate and its applicability in this experiment
have been cast into doubt. In this paper we show analytically that for a wide
range of parameters such a short laser pulse acts as an effective level
measurement to which the usual projection postulate applies with high accuracy.
The corrections to the ideal reductions and their accumulation over n pulses
are calculated. Our conclusion is that the projection postulate is an excellent
pragmatic tool for a quick and simple understanding of the slow-down of time
evolution in experiments of this type. However, corrections have to be
included, and an actual freezing does not seem possible because of the finite
duration of measurements.

in the conventional case. The origin of this irreversibility can be traced back
to different initial-boundary conditions for the states and observables. It is
shown that this irreversibility does not contradict the experimentally tested
consequences of the time-reversal invariance of the conventional case but
instead we have to introduce a new time reversal operator.

Fourier transforms of time correlation functions, as given by the quantum
regression theorem for systems described by master equations. Quantum state
diffusion (QSD) gives a useful method of solving these problems by unraveling
the master equation into stochastic trajectories; but there is no generally
accepted definition of a time correlation function for a single QSD trajectory.
In this paper we show how QSD can be used to calculate these spectra directly;
by formally solving the equations which arise, we arrive at a natural
definition for a two-time correlation function in QSD, which depends explicitly
on both the stochastic noise of the particular trajectory and the time of
measurement, and which agrees in the mean with the ensemble average definition
of correlation functions.

decreased, near a critical temperature $T_c$ the harmonic approximation for the

these poles completely determine the eigenvalues in these two cases, the

for the uncertainty principle. A gedankenexperiment using Feynman's double-hole

effect the change in the wave function that occurs in measurement in quantum

in the wave function, not a physical interaction between the physical existent
measured and the measuring instrument. Empirical work on electron shelving that

mechanics is presented. We first critically review the consistent histories
approach to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics in a mathematically rigorous way
and give some general comments about it. We investigate to what extent the
consistent histories scheme is compatible with the results of the operational
formulation of quantum mechanics. According to the operational approach
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is most generally formulated in terms of
effects, states and operations. We formulate a generalized consistent histories
theory using the concepts and the terminology which have proven useful in the
operational formulation of quantum mechanics. The logical rule of the logical
interpretation of quantum mechanics is generalized to the present context. The
algebraic structure of the generalized theory is studied in detail.

  of Open Systems</title><description>  We analyse the evolution of a quantum oscillator in a finite temperature
environment using the quantum state diffusion (QSD) picture. Following a
treatment similar to that of reference [7] we identify stationary solutions of
the corresponding It\^o equation. We prove their global stability and compute
typical time scales characterizing the localization process. The recovery of
the density matrix in approximately diagonal form enables us to verify the
approach to thermal equilibrium in the long time limit and we comment on the
connection between QSD and the decoherent histories approach.

Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of ${}^{87}$Rb atoms in an anisotropic
magnetic trap is discussed. Given the aspect ratio $R$, the quality of BEC is
estimated. A simple analytical Ansatz for the initial condensate wave function
is proposed as a function of the aspect ratio which, in contrast to the
Baym-Pethick trial wave function, reproduces both the weak and the strong
intaraction limits and which is in better agreement with numerical results than
the latter.

  Series Expansion</title><description>  The order dependent mapping method, its convergence has recently been proven
for the energy eigenvalue of the anharmonic oscillator, is applied to re-sum
the standard perturbation series for Stark effect of the hydrogen atom. We
perform a numerical experiment up to the fiftieth order of the perturbation
expansion. A simple mapping suggested by the analytic structure and the strong
field behavior gives an excellent agreement with the exact value for an
intermediate range of the electric field, $0.03\leq E\leq0.25$. The imaginary
part of the energy (the decay width) as well as the real part of the energy is
reproduced from the standard perturbation series.

The protocol can easily be implemented with present technology and is secure
against cheaters with unlimited computing power provided the receiver does not
have the technology to store the particles for an arbitrarily long period of
time. The proposed protocol is a significant improvement over the previous
protocols. Unlike the protocol of Cr\'epeau and Kilian which is secure if only
if the spin of the particle is measured along the $x$ or the $y$ axis, the
present protocol is perfectly secure no matter along which axes the spin of the
particles are measured, and unlike the protocol of Bennett et al. which
requires tens of thousand of particles, the present protocol requires only two
particles.

that causes the $\Delta T=1$ (p, p') and (p, n) reactions off nuclei is
studied. It is shown that the corrections to the impulse approximation comes
from the $g$-matrix type correction and the rearrangement term. They are
numerically estimated with the isospin-asymmetric nuclear-matter reaction
matrix approach. The analysis of the isobaric analog transitions

rectangular billiard with a single point-like scatterer, which is known as
pseudointegrable. It is shown that the observed $P(S)$ is a new type, which is
quite different from the previous conclusion. Even in the strong coupling
limit, the Poisson-like behavior rather than Wigner-like is seen for $S&gt;1$,
although the level repulsion still remains in the small $S$ region. The
difference from the previous works is analyzed in detail.

with the generalized coherent states. This is determined by special orbits in
the parameter space defining the coherent state, which is obtained as a
solution of the variational equation governed by a simple model Hamiltonian
called the &quot;resonant Hamiltonian&quot;. Three typical coherent states are
considered: SU(2), SU(1,1) and Heisenberg-Weyl. A possible experimental
detection of the phases is proposed in such a way that the geometric phases can
be discriminated from the dynamical phase.

momentum operator frequently appear in quantum mechanics. We prove that
physically reasonable minimum-uncertainty solutions to such relations have
quantized expectation values of the conjugate momentum. This implies, for
example, that the mean angular momentum is quantized for any
minimum-uncertainty state obtained from any uncertainty relation involving the
angular-momentum operator and a conjugate coordinate. Experiments specifically
seeking to create minimum-uncertainty states localized in angular coordinates
therefore must produce packets with integer angular momentum.

the foundations of quantum mechanics and how it is related to the usual quantum
formalism. We then turn to some objections to Bohmian mechanics, for example
the fact that in Bohmian mechanics there is no back action of particle
configurations upon wave functions. These lead us to our main concern: a more
careful consideration of the meaning of the wave function in quantum mechanics,
as suggested by a Bohmian perspective. We propose that the reason, on the
universal level, that there is no action of configurations upon wave functions,
as there seems to be between all other elements of physical reality, is that
the wave function of the universe is not an element of physical reality. We
propose that the wave function belongs to an altogether different category of
existence than that of substantive physical entities, and that its existence is
nomological rather than material. We propose, in other words, that the wave
function is a component of physical law rather than of the reality described by
the law.

of k qubits (2-state quantum systems) into a subspace of the quantum state
space of n qubits such that if any t of the qubits undergo arbitrary
decoherence, not necessarily independently, the resulting n qubits can be used
to faithfully reconstruct the original quantum state of the k encoded qubits.
Quantum error-correcting codes are shown to exist with asymptotic rate k/n = 1
- 2H(2t/n) where H(p) is the binary entropy function -p log p - (1-p) log
(1-p). Upper bounds on this asymptotic rate are given.
