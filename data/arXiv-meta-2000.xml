algebra is obtained. The state bears the generally deformed oscillator
algebraic structure. It is found that the Perelomov's coherent state is a
su(1,1) nonlinear coherent state. The expansion and the exponential form of the

su(1,1) displacement operator in terms of the hypergeometric functions and the

  Deformed Stirling Numbers</title><description>  The normal ordering formulae for powers of the boson number operator
$\hat{n}$ are extended to deformed bosons. It is found that for the `M-type'
deformed bosons, which satisfy $a a^{\dagger} - q a^{\dagger} a = 1$, the
extension involves a set of deformed Stirling numbers which replace the
Stirling numbers occurring in the conventional case. On the other hand, the
deformed Stirling numbers which have to be introduced in the case of the
`P-type' deformed bosons, which satisfy $a a^{\dagger} - q a^{\dagger} a =
q^{-\hat{n}}$, are found to depend on the operator $\hat{n}$. This distinction
between the two types of deformed bosons is in harmony with earlier
observations made in the context of a study of the extended
Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff formula.

classical communication among the parties, and yet when any two of the parties

interacting with the environment modeled by a set of independent harmonic

the time evolution of a coherent state or the superposition of two coherent
states of a harmonic oscillator as a simple system displaying the peculiarities
of the transition from quantum to classical regime. Chapters 4 and 5 concern
the electron transfer (ET) problem, namely the mathematical description of the
ET in molecular zinc-porphyrin-quinone complexes modeling artificial
photosynthesis (chapter 4) and photoinduced processes in the porphyrin triad
(chapter 5). Each chapter starts with an introduction and ends with a brief

equation including dynamic charge. This charge derives from density
oscillations of a particle; it is not discrete, but continuous. Within the
dynamic model of hydrogen it accounts for all features of electron proton
interactions, its origin are density oscillations of the proton. We propose a
new system of electromagnetic units, based on meter, kilogram, and second,
bearing on these findings. The system has none of the disadvantages of
traditional three-unit systems. On the basis of our theoretical model we can
genuinely derive the scaling factor between electromagnetic and mechanic
variables, which is equal, within a few percent, to Planck's constant h. The
implications of the results in view of unifying gravity and quantum theory are
discussed. It seems that the hypothetical solar gravity waves, in the low
frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum, are open to experimental

(i.e. with the bath's environment) allows for choosing the conditions under
which the decoherence of the qubit's states can be substantially decreased (in
a certain limit: completely avoided). By &quot;substantially decreased&quot; we mean that
the correlations which involve the bath's states prove negligible, while the
correlations between the qubit's and the environment's states can be made
ineffective during a comparatively long time interval. So, effectively, one may
choose the conditions under which, for sufficiently long time interval, the
initial state of &quot;qubit + bath&quot; remains unchanged, thus removing any kind of
the errors. The method has been successfully employed in the (simplified) model
of the solid-state-nuclear quantum computer (proposed by Kane).

in the context of the one-atom maser. The model involves a microwave cavity
into which two-level Rydberg atoms are pumped in pairs. We consider a random
pump mechanism which allows the presence of at most one pair of atoms in the
cavity at any time. We analyze the differences between the present system,
called the Dicke micromaser, and an equivalently pumped conventional one-atom
micromaser. These differences are attributed to the Dicke cooperativity in the
two-atom system. We also show that the two-atom Dicke micromaser is equivalent
to a one-atom cascade two-photon micromaser. With the introduction of a
one-photon detuning, the present theory further describes a true two-photon
micromaser. We discuss in detail the role of one-photon detuning in the
mechanism of a one-atom two-photon micromaser. This leads us to point out that
the two-atom cavity dynamics can be verified by a proper scaling of the results
from an equivalent one-atom two-photon micromaser.

sufficient condition for separability of a density matrix $\rho $ relative to
the $H^{[ d_{k}]}$ in terms of the $L_{1}$ norm of the spin coefficients of

shown that the Schr\&quot;odinger equation for the whole system can be reduced to
Bloch-type rate equations describing the combined time-development of the
detector and the measured system. Using these equations we find that continuous
measurement of the unstable system does not affect its exponential decay to a
reservoir with a constant density of states. The width of the energy
distribution of the tunneling electron, however, is not equal to the inverse
life-time -- it increases due to the decoherence generated by the detector. We
extend the analysis to the case of a reservoir described by an energy dependent
density of states, and we show that continuous measurement of such quantum
systems affects both the exponential decay rate and the energy distribution.
The decay does not always slow down, but might be accelerated. The energy
distribution of the tunneling electron may reveal the lines invisible before
the measurement.

rather than antiunitary, with energy being a time vector changing sign under
time inversion. The Dirac equation, in the case of electromagnetic interaction,
is not invariant under unitary time inversion, giving rise to a ``Klein
paradox''. To render unitary time inversion invariance, a nonlinear wave
equation is constructed, in which the ``Klein paradox'' disappears. In the case
of Coulomb interaction, the revised nonlinear equation can be linearized to
give energy solutions for Hydrogen-like ions without singularity when nuclear
number $Z&gt;137$, showing a reversed energy order pending for experimental tests
such as Zeeman effects. In non-relativistic limit, this nonlinear equation
reduces to nonlinear schr\&quot;odinger equation with soliton-like solutions.
Moreover, particle conjugation and electron-proton scattering with a
nonsingular current-potential interaction are discussed. Finally the explicit
form of gauge function is found, the uniqueness of Lorentz gauge is proven and
the Lagrangian density of quantum electrodynamics (QED) is revised as well. The

with an infinite or a limited frequency band is analyzed. The evanescent wave
is characterized by a forerunner (transient) related to the precise way the
source is switched on. It is followed by an asymptotic, monochromatic wave
which at long times reveals the oscillation frequency of the source. For a
source with a sharp onset the forerunner is exponentially larger than the
monochromatic solution and a transition from the transient regime to the
asymtotic regime occurs only at asymptotically large times. In this case, the
traversal time for tunneling plays already a role only in the transient regime.
To enhance the monochromatic solution compared to the forerunner we investigate
(a) frequency band limited sources and (b) the short time Fourier analysis (the
spectrogram) corresponding to a detector which is frequency band limited.
Neither of these two methods leads to a precise determination of the traversal
time. However, if they are limited to determine the traversal time only with a
precision of the traversal time itself both methods are successful: In this
case the transient behavior of the evanescent waves is at a time of the order
of the traversal time followed by a monochromatic wave which reveals the
frequency of the source.

boson and fermionic ones. The quantum discrete nonlinear Schroedinger model
(DNLS) is our main objective, but its so called modified discrete nonlinear
(MDNLS) version is also included, together with the fermionic polaron (FP)
model. Based on the respective dynamical symmetries of the models, a method is
put forward which by use of the associated boson and spin coherent state
vectors (CSV) and a factorization ansatz for the solution of the Schroedinger
equation, leads to quasiclassical Hamiltonian equations of motion for the CSV
parameters. Analysing the geometrical content of the factorization ansatz made
for the state vectors invokes the study of the Riemannian and symplectic
geometry of the CSV manifolds as generalized phase spaces. Next, we investigate
analytically and numerically the behavior of mean values and uncertainties of
some physically interesting observables as well as the modifications in the
quantum regime of processes such as the discrete self trapping (DST), in terms
of the Q-function and the distribution of excitation quanta of the lattice
sites. Quantum DST in the symmetric ordering of lattice operators is found to
be relatively enhanced with respect to the classical DST. Finally, the meaning
of the factorization ansatz for the lattice wave function is explained in terms
of disregarded quantum correlations, and as a quantitative figure of merit for
that ansatz a correlation index is introduced.

describing the physics inside a volume (including gravity) is bounded by the
area of the boundary (also called the screen) which encloses this volume. A
stronger statement is that these (quantum) degrees of freedom live on the
boundary and describe the physics inside the volume completely. The obvious
question is, what mechanism is behind the holographic principle. Recently, 't
Hooft argued that the quantum degrees of freedom on the boundary are not
fundamental. We argue that this interpretation opens up the possibility that
the mapping between the theory in the bulk (the holographic theory) and the
theory on the screen (the dual theory) is always given by a (generalized)
procedure of stochastic quantization. We show that gravity causes differences
to the situation in Minkowski/Euclidean spacetime and argue that the fictitious
coordinate needed in the stochastic quantization procedure can be spatial. The
diffusion coefficient of the stochastic process is in general a function of
this coordinate. While a mapping of a bulk theory onto a (quantum) boundary
theory can be possible, such a mapping does not make sense in spacetimes in
which the area of the screen is growing with time. This is connected to the
average process in the formalism of stochastic quantization. We show where the
stochastic quantization procedure breaks down and argue, in agreement with `t
Hooft, that the quantum degrees of freedom are not fundamental degrees of
freedom. They appear as a limit of a more complex process.

particular, we find the remarkable fact that the twisting of the constraining
potential appears as a gauge potential in the constrained Hamiltonian. This
gauge potential is an example of geometric phase, closely related to that
originally discussed by Berry. The constrained Hamiltonian also contains an
effective potential depending on the external curvature of the constraint

the S-matrix pole position s_R. For the Z-boson this means that $M_R \approx

of adiabatic quantum entanglement based on the Born-Oppenhemeir approximation.
In the adiabatic limit, it is shown that the wave function of the total system
formed by the quantum system plus the large system can be factorized as an
entangled state with correlation between adiabatic quantum states and
quasi-classical motion configurations of the large system. In association with
a novel viewpoint about quantum measurement, which has been directly verified
by most recent experiments [e.g, S. Durr et.al, Nature 33, 359 (1998)], it is
shown that the adiabatic entanglement is indeed responsible for the quantum
decoherence and thus it can be regarded as a &quot;clean&quot; quantum measurement when
the large system behaves as a classical object. The large system being taken
respectively to be a macroscopically distinguishable spatial variable, a high
spin system and a harmonic oscillator with a coherent initial state, three
illustrations are present with their explicit solutions in this paper.

engineering, the most abstract reaches of theoretical physics has spawned
topological models having a finite dimensional internal state space with no
natural tensor product structure and in which the evolution of the state is
discrete, H = 0. These are called topological quantum filed theories (TQFTs).
These exotic physical systems are proved to be efficiently simulated on a

a model of computation stronger than the usual quantum model BQP. 2. TQFTs

complexity and average-case classical query complexity. Specifically, we show
that if a quantum computer can evaluate a total Boolean function f with bounded
error using T queries in the worst case, then a deterministic classical
computer can evaluate f using O(T^5) queries in the average case, under a
uniform distribution of inputs. If f is monotone, we show furthermore that only
O(T^3) queries are needed. Previously, Beals et al. (1998) showed that if a
quantum computer can evaluate f with bounded error using T queries in the worst
case, then a deterministic classical computer can evaluate f using O(T^6)
queries in the worst case, or O(T^4) if f is monotone. The optimal bound is
conjectured to be O(T^2), but improving on O(T^6) remains an open problem.
Relating worst-case quantum complexity to average-case classical complexity may
suggest new ways to reduce the polynomial gap in the ordinary worst-case versus
worst-case setting.

the sensitivity of optical magnetometers resulting from ac-Stark shifts. We
show that in contrast to absorption-based techniques, the signal reduction
associated with classical broadening can be compensated in magnetometers based
on phase measurements using electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT).
However due to ac-Stark associated quantum noise the signal-to-noise ratio of
EIT-based magnetometers attains a maximum value at a certain laser intensity.
This value is independent on the quantum statistics of the light and defines a
standard quantum limit of sensitivity. We demonstrate that an EIT-based optical
magnetometer in Faraday configuration is the best candidate to achieve the
highest sensitivity of magnetic field detection and give a detailed analysis of
such a device.

coherent states with respect to generalized su(2) and su(1,1) generators, and
multiparticle parity states arise as a special case. As a special example of

these entangled binomial states enable the contraction from entangled SU(2)

outlining the characterisation, due to Birkhoff and Von Neumann, of the logical
structures of the theories of classical physics and quantum mechanics, as
boolean and modular lattices respectively. We then derive these descriptions
from what we claim are basic properties of any physical theory - i.e. the
notion that a quantity in such a theory may be analysed into parts and that the
results of this analysis may be treated in languages with an underlying boolean
structure. We shall see that in the course of constructing a model of a theory
with these properties different indistinguishable possibilities will arise for
how the elements of the model may be named, that is to say different
possibilities arise for how they can be associated with points from Set. Taking
a particular collection of possibilities gives the usual boolean lattice of the
propositions of classical physics. Taking all possibilities - in a sense, the
set of all things that may be described by physical theories - gives the
lattice of quantum mechanical propositions. This gives an interpretation of
quantum mechanics as the complete set of such possible descriptions, the
complete physical description of the world.

This process is shown to be a computational resource. It allows one, in

measurements only. To do so, one considers the given matrix as an observable of
a single spin with appropriate length s=(N-1)/2, which can be measured using a

the observable. As it is based on the `collapse of the wave function'

the Heisenberg convenient operator way of its describing, using the
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics laws and its mathematical results. We
describe the forced stochastically diverse circular oscillation motion, created
by force of the electrical interaction of the SchEl's elementary electric
charge with the electric intensity of the resultant quantum electromagnetic
field of the existing StchVrtPhtns, as a solution of Abraham-Lorentz equation.
By dint of this equation we obtain that the smooth thin line of a classical
macro particle is rapidly broken of many short and disorderly orientated lines,
owing the continuous dispersion of the quantum micro particle (QntMicrPrt) on
the StchVrtPhtns. Between two successive scattering the centers of diverse
circular oscillations with stochastically various radii are moving along this
short disordered line. These circular oscillations lie within the flats,
perpendicular to same disordered short line, along which are moving its
centers. In a result of same forced circular oscillation motion the smooth thin
line of the LrEl is roughly spread and turned out into some cylindrically wide
path of the SchEl. Hence the dispersions of different dynamical parameters,
determining the state of the SchEl, which are results of its continuously
interaction with the resultant quantum electromagnetic field of the
StchVrtPhtns. The absence of the smooth thin line trajectory at the circular
oscilation moving of the QntMicrPrt forces us to use the matrix elements
(Fourier components) of its roughly spread wide cylindrical path for its
description.

(or covariant symbol) of an operator product, is absolutely convergent for a
large class of operators. In particular, the generalized Liouville equation,
describing the time evolution of the Husimi function, is absolutely convergent
for a large class of Hamiltonians. By contrast, the series derived by
Groenewold, giving the Weyl transform of an operator product, is often only
asymptotic, or even undefined. The result is used to derive an alternative way
of expressing expectation values in terms of the Husimi function. The advantage
of this formula is that it applies in many of the cases where the anti-Husimi
transform (or contravariant symbol) is so highly singular that it fails to
exist as a tempered distribution.

problem, based on adiabatic evolution. The evolution of the quantum state is
governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that interpolates between an initial
Hamiltonian, whose ground state is easy to construct, and a final Hamiltonian,
whose ground state encodes the satisfying assignment. To ensure that the system
evolves to the desired final ground state, the evolution time must be big
enough. The time required depends on the minimum energy difference between the
two lowest states of the interpolating Hamiltonian. We are unable to estimate
this gap in general. We give some special symmetric cases of the satisfiability
problem where the symmetry allows us to estimate the gap and we show that, in
these cases, our algorithm runs in polynomial time.

quantum theory, and has recently come to play an essential role for physicists
in their development of quantum information theory. In this paper we show how
the formalism of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT) provides a rigorous
framework within which to analyze entanglement in the context of a fully
relativistic formulation of quantum theory. What emerges from the analysis are
new practical and theoretical limitations on an experimenter's ability to
perform operations on a field in one spacetime region that can disentangle its
state from the state of the field in other spacelike-separated regions. These
limitations show just how deeply entrenched entanglement is in relativistic
quantum field theory, and yield a fresh perspective on the ways in which the
theory differs conceptually from both standard nonrelativistic quantum theory
and classical relativistic field theory.

large n in a quantum computer using nuclear spins. The computational cost of a
quantum algorithm has usually been estimated as the sum of the universal gates
required in such ideal mathematical models as the Quantum Turing Machine(QTM)
and the quantum circuit. This cost is proportional to an actual time-cost in
the physical implementation where all quantum operations can be achieved in the
same time. However, if the implementation takes a different time for each
quantum gate, there is a possibility that the actual time-cost will have a
different behavior from the ideal cost. So we estimated the actual time-cost of
the QFT in these implementations by considering the gating time. The actual
time-cost is drastically different from O(n^2) estimated by complexity
analysis.

transport descriptions. In the first part the coupling of soft photon modes to
a source of charged particles is studied in a classical model which can be
solved completely in analytical terms. The solution corresponds to a
re-summation of certain field theory diagrams. The general properties of broad
resonances in dense finite temperature systems are discussed at the example of
the $\rho$-meson in hadronic matter. The second part addresses the problem of
transport descriptions which also account for the damping width of the
particles. The Kadanoff--Baym equation after gradient approximation together
with the $\Phi$-derivable method of Baym provides a self-consistent and
conserving scheme. Memory effects appearing in collision term diagrams of
higher order are discussed. We derive a generalized expression for the
nonequilibrium kinetic entropy flow, which includes corrections from
fluctuations and mass-width effects. In special cases an $H$-theorem is proved.
Memory effects in collision terms provide contributions to the kinetic entropy
flow that in the Fermi-liquid case recover the famous bosonic type $T^3 \ln T$

description of quantum mechanics. Our computational methodology is based upon a
finite-element moving least-squares method (MWLS) presented recently by Wyatt
and co-workers (Lopreore and Wyatt, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 82}, 5190 (1999)).
This method treats the &quot;particles&quot; in the quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation as
Lagrangian fluid elements which carry the phase, $S$, and density,
  $\rho$, required to reconstruct the quantum wavefunctions. Here, we compare
results obtained via the MWLS procedure to exact results obtained either
analytically or by numerical solution of the time dependent Schr\&quot;odinger
equation. Two systems are considered: firstly, dynamics in a harmonic well and
secondly tunneling dynamics in a double well potential. In the case of
tunneling in the double well potential, the quantum potential acts to lower the
barrier separating the right and left hand sides of the well permitting
trajectories to pass from one side to another.
  However, as probability density passes from one side to the other, the
effective barrier begins to rise and eventually will segregate trajectories in
one side from the other. We note that the MWLS trajectories exhibited long time
stability in the purely harmonic cases. However, this stability was not evident
in the barrier crossing dynamics. Comparisons to exact trajectories obtained
via wave packet calculations indicate that the MWLS trajectories tend to
underestimate the effects of constructive and destructive interference effects.

more effective way of increasing entanglement. An explicit decomposition into

inefficiencies (here arising from nontrivial vacuum structure). The blackbody
distribution is indistinguishable from the Planck law for T&lt;T_{critical} but
for T&gt;T_{critical} the maximum of the distribution gets lowered and shifts
towards higher frequencies. T_{critical} is a parameter that, in principle,

space-time configuration. Incorporating also, Einstein's special relativity,
leads to the quantum theory of fields. Non-relativistic quantum mechanics and
classical mechanics are special cases. By studying vacuum expectation values
(Wightman functions W(n; z) where z denotes the set of n complex variables) of
products of quantum field operators in a separable Hilbert space, one is led to
computation of holomorphy domains for these functions over the space of several
complex variables, C^n. Quantum fields were reconstructed from these functions
by Wightman. Computer automation has been accomplished as deterministic exact
analog computation (computation over &quot;cells&quot; in the continuum of C^n) for
obtaining primitive extended tube domains of holomorphy. This is done in a one
dimensional space plus one dimensional time model. By considering boundary
related semi-algebraic sets, some analytic extensions of these domains are
obtained by non-deterministic methods. The novel methods of computation raise
interesting issues of computability and complexity. Moreover, the computation
is independent of any particular form of Lagrangian or dynamics, and is uniform
in n, qualifying for a universal quantum machine over C^infinity.

phenomena between two neighboured resonance states. Level repulsion along the
real axis appears if the interaction is caused mainly by Re(H) while a
bifurcation of the widths appears if the interaction occurs mainly due to
Im(H). We then calculate the poles of the S-matrix and the corresponding
wavefunctions for a rectangular microwave resonator with a scatter as a
function of the area of the resonator as well as of the degree of opening to a
guide. The calculations are performed by using the method of exterior complex
scaling. Re(W) and Im(W) cause changes in the structure of the wavefunctions
which are permanent, as a rule. At full opening to the lead, short-lived
collective states are formed together with long-lived trapped states. The
wavefunctions of the short-lived states at full opening to the lead are very
different from those at small opening. The resonance picture obtained from the
microwave resonator shows all the characteristic features known from the study
of many-body systems in spite of the absence of two-body forces. The poles of
the S-matrix determine the conductance of the resonator. Effects arising from
the interplay between resonance trapping and level repulsion along the real
axis are not involved in the statistical theory.

The results show that heating is due to electric-field noise from the trap
electrodes which exerts a stochastic fluctuating force on the ion. The scaling
of the heating rate with trap size is much stronger than that expected from a
spatially uniform noise source on the electrodes (such as Johnson noise from
external circuits), indicating that a microscopic uncorrelated noise source on

unaffected by local manipulations of these parts. It is described by quantities
invariant under local unitary transformations. Here we present, for a system of
two qubits, a set of invariants which provides a complete description of
non-local properties. The set contains 18 real polynomials of the entries of
the density matrix. We prove that one of two mixed states can be transformed
into the other by single-bit operations if and only if these states have equal

efficiently. Without any of these 18 invariants the set is incomplete.
  Similarly, non-local, entangling properties of two-qubit unitary gates are
invariant under single-bit operations. We present a complete set of 3 real
polynomial invariants of unitary gates. Our results are useful for optimization
of quantum computations since they provide an effective tool to verify if and

  Landauer's principle and the Second Law</title><description>  Landauer's principle states that the erasure of one bit of information
requires the free energy kT ln 2. We argue that the reliability of the bit
erasure process is bounded by the accuracy inherent in the statistical state of
the energy source (`the resources') driving the process. We develop a general
framework describing the `thermodynamic worth' of the resources with respect to
reliable bit erasure or good cooling. This worth turns out to be given by the
distinguishability of the resource's state from its equilibrium state in the
sense of a statistical inference problem. Accordingly, Kullback-Leibler
relative information is a decisive quantity for the `worth' of the resource's
state. Due to the asymmetry of relative information, the reliability of the
erasure process is bounded rather by the relative information of the
equilibrium state wit respect to the actual state than by the relative
information of the actual state with respect to the equilibrium state (which is
the free energy up to constants).

A phase-space approach</title><description>  Using the symplectic tomography map, both for the probability distributions
in classical phase space and for the Wigner functions of its quantum

Because the marginal distributions, obtained by the tomography map, are always
well defined probabilities, the correspondence between classical and quantum
notions is very clear. Then we also obtain the corresponding expressions in
Hilbert space. Some examples are worked out. Classical and quantum exponents
are seen to coincide for local and non-local time-dependent quadratic
potentials. For non-quadratic potentials classical and quantum exponents are
different and some insight is obtained on the taming effect of quantum
mechanics on classical chaos. A detailed analysis is made for the standard map.
Providing an unambiguous extension of the notion of Lyapunov exponent to
quantum mechnics, the method that is developed is also computationally
efficient in obtaining analytical results for the Lyapunov exponent, both

isomorphic. The sets of all their self-adjoint operators are also therefore
unitarily equivalent. Thus if all self-adjoint operators can be observed, and
if there is no further major axiom in quantum physics than those formulated for
example in Dirac's `Quantum Mechanics', then a quantum physicist would not be
able to tell a torus from a hole in the ground. We argue that there are indeed
such axioms involving observables with smooth time evolution: they contain
commutative subalgebras from which the spatial slice of spacetime with its
topology (and with further refinements of the axiom, its $C^K-$ and $C^\infty-$
structures) can be reconstructed using Gel'fand - Naimark theory and its
extensions. Classical topology is an attribute of only certain quantum
observables for these axioms, the spatial slice emergent from quantum physics
getting progressively less differentiable with increasingly higher excitations
of energy and eventually altogether ceasing to exist. After formulating these
axioms, we apply them to show the possibility of topology change and to discuss
quantized fuzzy topologies. Fundamental issues concerning the role of time in
quantum physics are also addressed.

evolution by collapsing the atomic state into a pure state which evolves
stochastically. A robust unraveling is one that gives pure states that, on
average, are relatively unaffected by the master equation evolution (which
applies once the monitoring ceases). The ensemble of pure states arising from
the maximally robust unraveling has been suggested to be the most natural way
of representing the system [H.M. Wiseman and J.A. Vaccaro, Phys. Lett. A {\bf
250}, 241 (1998)]. We find that the maximally robust unraveling of a resonantly
driven atom requires an adaptive interferometric measurement proposed by
Wiseman and Toombes [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 60}, 2474 (1999)]. The resultant
ensemble consists of just two pure states which, in the high driving limit, are
close to the eigenstates of the driving Hamiltonian $\Omega\sigma_{x}/2$. This
ensemble is the closest thing to a classical limit for a strongly driven atom.
We also find that it is possible to reasonably approximate this ensemble using
just homodyne detection, an example of a continuous Markovian unraveling. This
has implications for other systems, for which it may be necessary in practice
to consider only continuous Markovian unravelings.

through respective cavities to interact off-resonantly with the cavity fields.
The atomic states are measured after the interaction. Bell's inequality can be
tested by the joint probabilities of two-level atoms being in their excited or

  Biocomputing</title><description>  Quantum search algorithms are considered in the context of protein sequence
comparison in biocomputing. Given a sample protein sequence of length m (i.e m
residues), the problem considered is to find an optimal match in a large
database containing N residues. Initially, Grover's quantum search algorithm is
applied to a simple illustrative case - namely where the database forms a
complete set of states over the 2^m basis states of a m qubit register, and
thus is known to contain the exact sequence of interest. This example
demonstrates explicitly the typical O(sqrt{N}) speedup on the classical O(N)
requirements. An algorithm is then presented for the (more realistic) case
where the database may contain repeat sequences, and may not necessarily
contain an exact match to the sample sequence. In terms of minimizing the
Hamming distance between the sample sequence and the database subsequences the
algorithm finds an optimal alignment, in O(sqrt{N}) steps, by employing an
extension of Grover's algorithm, due to Boyer, Brassard, Hoyer and Tapp for the
case when the number of matches is not a priori known.

  mechanics</title><description>  This paper defines, on the Galilean space-time, the group of asymptotically
Euclidean transformations (AET), which are equivalent to Euclidean
transformations at space-time infinity, and proposes a formulation of
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics which is invariant under such
transformations. This formulation is based on the asymptotic quantum measure,
which is shown to be invariant under AET's. This invariance exposes an
important connection between AET's and Feynman path integrals, and reveals the
nonmetric character of the asymptotic quantum measure. The latter feature
becomes even clearer when the theory is formulated in terms of the
coordinate-free formalism of asymptotically Euclidean manifold, which do not
have a metric structure. This mathematical formalism suggests the following
physical interpretation: (i) Particles evolution is represented by trajectories
on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold; (ii) The metric and the law of motion
are not defined a priori as fundamental entities, but they are properties of a
particular class of reference frames; (iii) The universe is considered as a
probability space in which the asymptotic quantum measure plays the role of a
probability measure. Points (ii) and (iii) are used to build the asymptotic
measurement theory, which is shown to be consistent with traditional quantum
measurement theory. The most remarkable feature of this measurement theory is
the possibility of having a nonchaotic distribution of the initial conditions
(NCDIC), an extremely counterintuitive but not paradoxical phenomenon which
allows to interpret typical quantum phenomena, such as particle diffraction and
tunnel effect, while still providing a description of their motion in terms of
classical trajectories.

predictions of a new theory of classical dynamics. The dynamical structure of
the new theory is given by the Moyal bracket. This is a Lie bracket that was
first derived as the dynamical structure of the Moyal-Weyl-Wigner formulation
of quantum mechanics. We present a new derivation of the Moyal bracket, this
time in the context of the semiclassical limit of quantum mechanics and thus
prove that both classical and quantum dynamics can be formulated in terms of
the same canonical structure.

systems that move in and interact with arbitrary environments. Their dynamics
is given as tasks which consist of sequences of alternating computation and
action phases. A task example is considered in which a quantum robot searches a
space region to find the location of a system. The possibility that the search
can be more efficient than a classical search is examined by considering use of
Grover's Algorithm to process the search results. For reversible searches this
is problematic for two reasons. One is the removal of entanglements generated
by the search process. The other is that even if the entanglement can be
avoided, the search process in 2-D space regions is no more efficient than a
classical search. However, quantum searches of space regions with 3 or more
dimensions are more efficient than classical searches. Reasons why quantum
robots are interesting independent of these results are briefly summarized.

the 171Yb fluorescence is interrupted by quantum jumps because a nonvanishing
rate of spontaneous transitions leads to electron shelving in the metastable
hyperfine sublevel 2D3/2(F=2). The average duration of the resulting dark

Optical heterodyne detection is employed to analyze the fluorescence spectrum

Lorentzian component in the fluorescence spectrum, and that the linewidth of
this component varies according to the average duration of the dark
fluorescence periods. The experimental observations are in quantitative

  Symmetric Configurations</title><description>  The perfect quenching of spin tunneling that has previously been discussed in
terms of interfering instantons, and has recently been observed in the magnetic
molecule \Fe8, is treated using a discrete phase integral (or
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) method. The simplest model Hamiltonian for the
phenomenon leads to a Schr\&quot;odinger equation that is a five-term recursion
relation. This recursion relation is reflection-symmetric when the magnetic
field applied to the molecule is along the hard magnetic axis. A completely
general Herring formula for the tunnel splittings for all reflection-symmetric
five-term recursion relations is obtained. Using connection formulas for a new
type of turning point that may be described as lying &quot;under the barrier&quot;, and
which underlies the oscillations in the splitting as a function of magnetic
field, this Herring formula is transformed into two other formulas that express
the splittings in terms of a small number of action and action-like integrals.
These latter formulas appear to be generally valid, even for problems where the
recursion contains more than five terms. The results for the model Hamiltonian
are compared with experiment, numerics, previous instanton based approaches,
and the limiting case of no magnetic field.

those required by general considerations like causality and consistency. We

  The control of the coherent dynamics is elucidated for the phenomenon of
coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT), i.e., the coherent dynamics of a
driven two-level atom in a quantum superposition state can be brought
practically to a complete standstill. We study this phenomenon for different
initial preparations of the two-level atom. We then proceed to investigate the
decoherence originating from the interaction of the two-level atom with a lossy
cavity mode. The loss mechanism is described in terms of a microscopic model
that couples the cavity mode to a bath of harmonic field modes. A suitably
tuned external cw-laser field applied to the two-level atom slows down
considerably the decoherence of the atom. We demonstrate the suppression of
decoherence for two opposite initial preparations of the atomic state: a
quantum superposition state as well as the ground state. These findings can be
used to the effect of a proficient battling of decoherence in qubit
manipulation processes.

  Asymmetric Configurations</title><description>  The perfect quenching of spin tunneling first predicted for a model with

further studied using the discrete phase integral (or
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) method. The analysis of the previous paper is
extended to the case where the magnetic field has both hard and easy
components, so that the Hamiltonian has no obvious symmetry. Herring's formula
is now inapplicable, so the problem is solved by finding the wavefunction and
using connection formulas at every turning point. A general formula for the
energy surface in the vicinity of the diabolo is obtained in this way. This
formula gives the tunneling apmplitude between two wells unrelated by symmetry
in terms of a small number of action integrals, and appears to be generally
valid, even for problems where the recursion contains more than five terms.
Explicit results are obtained for the diabolical points in the model for Fe_8.
These results exactly parallel the experimental observations. It is found that
the leading semiclassical results for the diabolical points appear to be exact,
and the points themselves lie on a perfect centered rectangular lattice in the
magnetic field space. A variety of evidence in favor of this perfect lattice
hypothesis is presented.

operator of an open system. Successive terms of those expansions yield
characteristic loss rates for dissipation processes. Three applications are
presented in order to give further insight into the context of those
expansions. The first application, of a two-level atom coupling to a bosonic
environment, shows the procedure and the advantage of the expansion, whereas
the second application that consists of a single mode field in a cavity with
linewidth $\kappa$ due to partial transmission through one mirror illustrates a
practical use of those expansions in quantum measurements, and the third one,
for an atom coupled to modes of a lossy cavity shows the another use of the
perturbative expansion.

$g_{2}$ and $g_{3}$ which are required to achieve binding of 2 or 3 bosons,
respectively, with a short-range interaction, and examine how this ratio
depends on the shape of the potential. Simple monotonous potentials give
$R\simeq 0.8$. A wide repulsive core pushes this ratio close to R=1. On the
other hand, for an attractive well protected by an external repulsive barrier,
the ratio approaches the rigorous lower bound $R=2/3$. We also present results
for N=4 bosons, sketch the extension to $N&gt;4$, and discuss various

by a detector and calculate the spectral density of the detector output. In the
weakly coupled case the spectrum exhibits a moderate peak at the frequency of
quantum oscillations and a Lorentzian-shape increase of the detector noise at
low frequency. With increasing coupling the spectrum transforms into a single
Lorentzian corresponding to random jumps between two states. We prove that the
Bayesian formalism for the selective evolution of the density matrix gives the
same spectrum as the conventional master equation approach, despite the
significant difference in interpretation. The effects of the detector
nonideality and the finite-temperature environment are also discussed.

bipartite state the one-way distillable entanglement is no less than coherent

operator, that corresponds to the path decomposition expansion, and interpret
its constituents in terms of the quantum Zeno effect (QZE). This decomposition

than those hitherto considered in the literature is shown. We reinterpret the

recent experiment by Brune et al., are studied with respect to the question of
complementarity. Three different procedures for obtaining information on the
state of the incoming atom are compared. Positive operator-valued measures are
explicitly calculated. It is demonstrated that, in principle, it is possible to
choose the experimental arrangement so as to admit an interpretation as a joint
non-ideal measurement yielding interference and ``which-way'' information.
Comparison of the different measurements gives insight into the question of
which information is provided by a (generalized) quantum mechanical
measurement. For this purpose the subspaces of Hilbert-Schmidt space, spanned
by the operators of the POVM, are determined for different measurement
arrangements and different values of the parameters.

interferometers if there are no decoherence effects. This aspect of the
interferometer can be translated into six-parameter representations of the
Lorentz group, as in the case of polarization optics where there are two
orthogonal components of one light beam. It is shown that there are groups of
transformations which leave the coherency or density matrix invariant, and this
symmetry property is formulated within the framework of Wigner's little groups.
An additional mathematical apparatus is needed for the transition from a pure

process, and their properties are studied in detail. Experimental tests of this

system interacting with the macroscopic world components which are modeled by
collections of bosonic modes. The interaction is via a general operator
$\Lambda$ of the system, coupled to the creation and annihilation operators of
the environment modes. We assume that in the process of a nearly instantaneous
quantum measurement, the function of the environment involves two distinct
parts: the pointer and the bath. Interaction of the system with the bath leads
to decoherence such that the system and the pointer both evolve into a
statistical mixture state described by the density matrix such that the system
is in one of the eigenstates of $\Lambda$ with the correct quantum mechanical
probability, whereas the expectation values of pointer operators retain
amplified information on that eigenstate. We argue that this process represents
the initial step of a quantum measurement. Calculation of the elements of the
reduced density matrix of the system and pointer is carried out exactly, and
time dependence of decoherence is identified. We discuss general implications
of our model of energy-conserving coupling to a heat bath for processes of
adiabatic quantum decoherence. We also evaluate changes in the expectation
values of certain pointer operators and suggest that these can be interpreted
as macroscopic indicators of the measurement outcome.

photon current fluctuations originating from a disordered medium. Both the
cases of an absorbing medium (``grey body'') and of an amplifying medium
(``random laser'') are considered in a waveguide geometry. The semiclassical
approach (based on a Boltzmann-Langevin equation) is shown to be in complete
agreement with a fully quantum mechanical theory, provided that the effects of
wave localization can be neglected. The width of the peak in the power spectrum
around zero frequency is much smaller than the inverse coherence time,
characteristic for black-body radiation. Simple expressions for the shape of
this peak are obtained, in the absorbing case, for waveguide lengths large
compared to the absorption length, and, in the amplifying case, close to the
laser threshold.

  Correlations</title><description>  Effects of the superconducting pair potential on the impurity scattering
processes in metallic carbon nanotubes are studied theoretically. The backward
scattering of electrons vanishes in the normal state. In the presence of the
superconducting pair correlations, the backward scatterings of electron- and
hole-like quasiparticles vanish, too. The impurity gives rise to backward
scatterings of holes for incident electrons, and it also induces backward
scatterings of electrons for incident holes. Negative and positive currents
induced by such the scatterings between electrons and holes cancel each other.
Therefore, the nonmagnetic impurity does not hinder the supercurrent in the
regions where the superconducting proximity effects occur, and the carbon
nanotube is a good conductor for Cooper pairs. Relations with experiments are
discussed.

  variables</title><description>  Ideally, quantum teleportation should transfer a quantum state without
distortion and without providing any information about that state. However,
quantum teleportation of continuous electromagnetic field variables introduces
additional noise, limiting the fidelity of the quantum state transfer. In this
article, the operator describing the quantum state transfer is derived. The
transfer operator modifies the probability amplitudes of the quantum state in a
shifted photon number base by enhancing low photon numbers and suppressing high
photon numbers. This modification of the statistical weight corresponds to a
measurement of finite resolution performed on the original quantum state. The
limited fidelity of quantum teleportation is thus shown to be a direct
consequence of the information obtained in the measurement.

  Amplitudes</title><description>  In a recent paper, we introduced a new way of treating systems of compounded
angular momentum. We obtained the probability amplitudes for measurements on
the systems and used these to derive the matrix treatment of compounded spin.
However, the matrix forms are in 3- and 4- dimensional space and are therefore
entirely different from the standard forms. This raises the question of the
connection between these forms and the standard forms. In this paper, we answer
this question. We not only derive the standard matrix treatment of spin
addition - we discover a more generalized form of the theory. We apply the new
generalized theory to the singlet and triplet states arising from the addition
of the spins of two systems of spin 1/2 each. We obtain new generalized forms
of the vectors and operators for these cases, and show that they reduce to the
standard forms in the appropriate limit.

and therefore cannot thermalize by themselves. Doppler shifts due to thermal
motions of cavity walls provide necessary mixing, but also preserve the
amplitudes and phases. The lambda/2 intervals of the modes thus preserved must
have equal energy expectations, say &lt;E&gt;, in the resulting equilibrium. By
definition again, they can be exchanged between modes only in whole numbers and
hence only between harmonics. Each family of harmonic modes is thus
self-contained and is disjoint from other families in such exchanges, and
further, can have no more than one mode excited at any instant. The second
property identifies harmonic families of standing wave modes as the harmonic
oscillators of Planck's theory, since a family can only bear energy equal to
exactly one of E, 2E, 3E, etc These two properties further imply that the
energy expectation gets averaged only over an individual family, as the
equilibrium energy &lt;E(f)&gt; steadily available at a given mode would have
contributions from its entire harmonic family. Planck's equations reemerge, and
radiation quantization arises as a classical rule &lt;E(f)&gt; = &lt;E&gt;f, as a mode must
contain a whole number of exchangeable lambda/2 intervals, but it only concerns
equilibrium states. The result makes Planck constant h an analogue of
Boltzmann's constant k for the frequency domain, and points to postulate-free
explanations of all aspects of quantum and kinetic theories.

Moreover, the quantum operations are shown to have a surprising structure in a

quantum systems. Any nonempty set and associated operations is a set of natural

of number theory or arithmetic. This work is limited to k-ary representations
of length L and to the axioms for arithmetic modulo k^{L}. A model of the
axioms is described based on states in and operators on an abstract L fold
tensor product Hilbert space H^{arith}. Unitary maps of this space onto a
physical parameter based product space H^{phy} are then described. Each of
these maps makes states in H^{phy}, and the induced operators, a model of the
axioms. Consequences of the existence of many of these maps are discussed along
with the dependence of Grover's and Shor's Algorithms on these maps. The
importance of the main physical requirement, that the basic arithmetic
operations are efficiently implementable, is discussed. This conditions states
that there exist physically realizable Hamiltonians that can implement the
basic arithmetic operations and that the space-time and thermodynamic resources
required are polynomial in L.

interaction between our conscious experiences and the physical activities of

mental effort is not affected by decoherence effects. In this theory the

Copenhagen quantum theory, which include all the validated predictions of

quanton (a quantum system consisting of a Boson or Fermion) can either behave
as a particle or as wave, but never simultaneosuly as both. A less orthodox
interpretation of this Principle is the ``duality condition'' embodied in a
mathematical inequality due to Englert [B-G Englert, Phys. Rev. Lett., Vol. 77,
2154 (1996)] which allows wave and particle attributes to co-exist, but
postulates that a stronger manifestation of the particle nature leads to a
weaker manifestation of the wave nature and vice versa. In this Letter, we show
that some recent {\it welcher weg} (&quot;which path&quot;) experiments in
interferometers and similar set-ups, that claim to have validated, or
invalidated, the Complementarity Principle, actually shed no light on the
orthodox interpretation. They may have instead validated the weaker duality
condition, but even that is not completely obvious. We propose simple
modifications to these experiments which we believe can test the orthodox
Complementarity Principle and also shed light on the nature of wavefunction
collapse and quantum erasure.

not possible to describe a particle as possessing, simultaneously, a sharp
position value and a sharp momentum value. Is it possible, though, to describe
a particle as possessing just a sharp position value (or just a sharp momentum

the answer to this question is No -- that the status of individual continuous

On the contrary, I shall show that the same subtle issues arise with respect to

quantum channel of a two-mode squeezed vacuum influenced by a thermal
environment. Each mode of the squeezed vacuum is assumed to undergo the same
thermal influence. It is found that when the mixed two-mode squeezed vacuum for
the quantum channel is separable, any nonclassical features, which may be
imposed in an original unknown state, cannot be transferred to a receiving
station. A two-mode Gaussian state, one of which is a mixed two-mode squeezed
vacuum, is separable if and only if a positive well-defined $P$ function can be
assigned to it. The fidelity of teleportation is considered in terms of the
noise factor given by the imperfect channel. It is found that quantum
teleportation may give more noise than direct transmission of a field under the
thermal environment, which is due to the fragile nature of quantum entanglement
of the quantum channel.

the nonlinearities already present in the theory via nonabelian gauge

to the best of our knowledge, the only one which does not introduce any new
elements into the theory. Indeed, unless the gauge interaction nonlinearities

The electrons should have a finite coherence length, while photons should have

naturally occurs if one considers a harmonic oscillator with indefinite

algebra naturally removes the infinite energy of vacuum but still results in a
theory which is very similar to quantum electrodynamics. An analysis of
perturbation theory shows that the non-canonical theory has an automatically
built-in cut-off but requires charge/mass renormalization already at the
nonrelativistic level. A simple rule allowing to compare perturbative
predictions of canonical and non-canonical theories is given. The notion of a
unique vacuum state is replaced by a set of different vacua. Multi-photon
states are defined in the standard way but depend on the choice of vacuum.
Making a simplified choice of the vacuum state we estimate corrections to
atomic lifetimes, probabilities of multiphoton spontaneous and stimulated
emission, and the Planck law. The results are practically identical to the
standard ones. Two different candidates for a free-field Hamiltonian are

  mechanics</title><description>  Modal interpretations constitute a particular approach to associating
dynamical variables with physical systems in quantum mechanics. Given the
`quantum logical' constraints that are typically adopted by such
interpretations, only certain sets of variables can be taken to be
simultaneously definite-valued, and only certain sets of values can be ascribed
to these variables at a given time. Moreover, each allowable set of variables
and values can be uniquely specified by a single `preferred' projector in the
Hilbert space associated with the system. In general, the preferred projector
can be one of several possibilities at a given time. In previous modal
interpretations, the different possible preferred projectors have formed an
orthogonal set. This paper investigates the consequences of adopting a
non-orthogonal set. We present three contributions on this issue: (1) we
provide an argument for such non-orthogonality, based on the assumption that
perfectly predictable measurements reveal pre-existing values of variables, an
assumption which has traditionally constituted a strong motivation for the
modal approach; (2) we generalize the existing framework for modal
interpretations to accommodate non-orthogonal preferred projectors; (3) we
present a novel type of modal interpretation wherein the set of preferred
projectors is fixed by a principle of entropy minimization, and we discuss some
of the successes and shortcomings of this proposal.

conductivity of the metals. The simple formalism of surface modes is briefly
presented which allows the possibility to obtain the generalization of Lifshitz
results for the case of two semi-spaces covered by the thin layers. Additional
clarifications of the regularization procedure provides the means to obtain
reliable results not only for the force but also for the energy density. This,
in turn, leads to the value of the force for the configuration of a sphere
(lens) above a plate both of which are covered by additional layers. The
Casimir interaction between Al and Au test bodies is recalculated using the
optical tabulated data for the complex refractive index of these metals. The
computations turn out to be in agreement with the perturbation theory up to the
fourth order in relative penetration depth of electromagnetic zero point
oscillations into the metal. The disagreements between the results recently
presented in the literature are resolved. The Casimir force between Al bodies
covered by the thin Au layers is computed and the possibility to neglect
spatial dispersion effects is discussed as a function the layer thickness. The
van der Waals force is calculated including the transition region to the
Casimir force. The pure non-retarded van der Waals force law between Al and Au
bodies is shown to be restricted to a very narrow distance interval from 0.5 nm
to (2--4) nm. New, more exact, values of the Hamaker constant for Al and Au are
determined.

algebra, where $C_{\lambda}$ is the cyclic group of order $\lambda$, are
studied both from mathematical and applied viewpoints. Casimir operators of the
algebras are obtained, and used to provide a complete classification of their
unitary irreducible representations under the assumption that the number
operator spectrum is nondegenerate. Deformed algebras admitting Casimir
operators analogous to those of their undeformed counterparts are looked for,
yielding three new algebraic structures. One of them includes the Brzezi\'nski
{\em et al.} deformation of the Calogero-Vasiliev algebra as a special case. In
its bosonic Fock-space representation, the realization of
$C_{\lambda}$-extended oscillator algebras as generalized deformed oscillator
ones is shown to provide a bosonization of several variants of supersymmetric
quantum mechanics: parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics of order $p =
\lambda-1$ for any $\lambda$, as well as pseudosupersymmetric and
orthosupersymmetric quantum mechanics of order two for $\lambda=3$.

(L-slice) discretization of the imaginary-time axis. In the auxiliary-field
method, the L-slice approximant to the density matrix can be evaluated as a
function of inverse temperature at any finite L as
$\rho_L(\beta)=[\rho_1(\beta/L)]^L$, if the density matrix $\rho_1(\beta)$ in
the static approximation is known. We investigate the convergence of the
partition function $Z_L(\beta)=Tr\rho_L(\beta)$, the internal energy and the
density of states $g_L(E)$ (the inverse Laplace transform of $Z_L$), as
$L\to\infty$. For the simple harmonic oscillator, $g_L(E)$ is a normalized
truncated Fourier series for the exact density of states. When the
auxiliary-field approach is applied to spin systems, approximants to the
density of states and heat capacity can be negative. Approximants to the
density matrix for a spin-1/2 dimer are found in closed form for all L by
appending a self-interaction to the divergent Gaussian integral and
analytically continuing to zero self-interaction. Because of this continuation,
the coefficient of the singlet projector in the approximate density matrix can
be negative. For a spin dimer, $Z_L$ is an even function of the coupling
constant for L&lt;3: ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling can be
distinguished only for $L\ge 3$, where a Berry phase appears in the functional
integral. At any non-zero temperature, the exact partition function is
recovered as $L\to\infty$.

periodic table of elementary particles. The periodic table is derived from
dimensional hierarchy for the seven extra spatial dimensions. As a molecule is
the composite of atoms with chemical bonds, a hadron is the composite of
elementary particles with hadronic bonds. The masses of elementary particles
and hadrons can be calculated using the periodic table with only four known
constants: the number of the extra spatial dimensions in the superstring, the
mass of electron, the mass of Z=B0, and the fine structure constant. The
calculated masses are in good agreement with the observed values. For examples,
the calculated masses for the top quark, neutron, and pion are 176.5 GeV,
939.54MeV, and 135.01MeV in excellent agreement with the observed masses, 176
=B1 13 GeV, 939.57 MeV, and 134.98 MeV, respectively. The masses of 110 hadrons

and the observed masses for all hadrons is 0.29 MeV. The periodic table of
elementary particles provides the most comprehensive explanation and
calculation for the masses of elementary particles and hadrons.

states whose teleportation fidelity can be enhanced by subjecting one of the
qubits to dissipative interaction with the environment via amplitude damping
channel (ADC). We show that such noisy states result while sharing the states
(| \Phi ^{\pm}&gt; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(| 00&gt; \pm | 11&gt;)) across ADC. We also show
that under similar dissipative interactions different Bell states give rise to
noisy entangled states that are qualitatively very different from each other in
the sense, only the noisy entangled states constructed from the Bell states (|
\Phi ^{\pm}&gt;) can \emph{}be made better sometimes by subjecting the unaffected
qubit to a dissipative interaction with the environment. Importantly if the
noisy state is non teleporting then it can always be made teleporting with this
prescription. We derive the most general restrictions on improvement of such
noisy states assuming that the damping parameters being different for both the
qubits. However this curious prescription does not work for the noisy entangled
states generated from (| \Psi ^{\pm}&gt; =\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(| 01&gt; \pm | 10&gt;)).
This shows that an apriori knowledge of the noisy channel might be helpful to
decide which Bell state needs to be shared between Alice and Bob. \emph{}

by applying a suitable displacement operator $D_{h}(\alpha) $ to the vacuum
state. The unity resolutions in terms of the projectors $| \alpha, h&gt; &lt; \alpha,

allowing a resolution in terms of $| \alpha, h&gt; &lt; \alpha, h| $. $D_{h}(\alpha)

$\rho_{A,h}(z) $ while the existence of a measure is exploited for extending
the P-representation to these states. The weight of the n-th Fock state of the
NCS relative to a trapped ion with Lamb-Dicke parameter $\eta ,$ oscillates so
wildly as $n$ grows up to infinity that the normalized NCS fill the open circle
$\eta ^{-1}$ in the complex $\alpha $-plane. In addition this prevents the
existence of a measure including normalizable states only. This difficulty is
overcome by introducing a family of deformations which are rational functions
of n, each of them admitting a measure. By increasing the degree of these
rational approximations the deformation of a trapped ion can be approximated
with any degree of accuracy and the formalism of the P-representation can be
applied.

sites which can be either empty or occupied by a fermion. With the standard
correspondence between the Foch space of $m$ LFMs and the Hilbert space of $m$
qubits, simulation of one fermionic gate takes $O(m)$ qubit gates and vice

reduced to $O(\log m)$ and a constant, respectively. Nearest-neighbors
fermionic gates on a graph of bounded degree can be simulated at a constant

with Majorana fermions which are basically halves of LFMs. Some connection to

exhibit: (i) dimensional transmutation and (ii) rotational invariance. Using
dimensional regularization, the two-dimensional delta-function potential and
the $D$-dimensional inverse square potential are studied. In particular, the
following features are analyzed: the existence of a critical coupling, the
boundary condition at the origin, the relationship between the bound-state and
scattering sectors, and the similarities displayed by both potentials. It is
found that, for rotationally symmetric scale-invariant potentials, there is a
strong-coupling regime, for which quantum-mechanical breaking of symmetry takes
place, with the appearance of a unique bound state as well as of a logarithmic
energy dependence of the scattering with respect to the energy.

  general theory and application to a spherical cavity</title><description>  A formalism for studying spontaneous decay of an excited two-level atom in
the presence of dispersing and absorbing dielectric bodies is developed. An
integral equation, which is suitable for numerical solution, is derived for the
atomic upper-state-probability amplitude. The emission pattern and the power
spectrum of the emitted light are expressed in terms of the Green tensor of the
dielectric-matter formation including absorption and dispersion. The theory is
applied to the spontaneous decay of an excited atom at the center of a
three-layered spherical cavity, with the cavity wall being modeled by a
band-gap dielectric of Lorentz type. Both weak coupling and strong coupling are
studied, the latter with special emphasis on the cases where the atomic
transition is (i) in the normal-dispersion zone near the medium resonance and
(ii) in the anomalous-dispersion zone associated with the band gap. In a
single-resonance approximation, conditions of the appearance of Rabi
oscillations and closed solutions to the evolution of the atomic state
population are derived, which are in good agreement with the exact numerical
results.

instrument puts models written in equations of quantum mechanics in contact
with instruments. This contact is recordable in files of a Classical Digital
Process-control Computer (CPC) used both to calculate with the equations and to
manage the instruments. By noticing that equations and instruments make contact
in a CPC, we rewrite equations of quantum mechanics to explicitly include
functions of CPC-commands to the instruments. This sets up a proof that a
scientist's choice in linking mathematical models to instruments is
unresolvable without guesswork to narrow the set of models from which one is to
be chosen.
  As for implications of the proof, scientists inherit choices from the past
and frame choices for the future, choices open to guesswork and visible in CPC
files. To picture these choices, we adapt colored Petri nets, and the
availability of these net fragments makes choice and guesswork part and parcel
of physics.
  Net fragments as a means of expressing guess-demanding choices are applied to
portray guesswork needed in testing and calibrating a quantum computer. The
sample size required to test a quantum gate in a quantum computer is shown to
grow as the inverse square of the error allowed in implementing the gate.

to quantize systems with constraints. We study the quantization of systems with
general first- and second-class constraints from the point of view of
coherent-state, phase-space path integration, and show that all such cases may
be treated, within the original classical phase space, by using suitable
path-integral measures for the Lagrange multipliers which ensure that the
quantum system satisfies the appropriate quantum constraint conditions. Unlike
conventional methods, our procedures involve no $\delta$-functionals of the
classical constraints, no need for dynamical gauge fixing of first-class
constraints nor any average thereover, no need to eliminate second-class
constraints, no potentially ambiguous determinants, as well as no need to add
auxiliary dynamical variables expanding the phase space beyond its original
classical formulation, including no ghosts. Besides several pedagogical
examples, we also study: (i) the quantization procedure for reparameterization
invariant models, (ii) systems for which the original set of Lagrange
mutipliers are elevated to the status of dynamical variables and used to define
an extended dynamical system which is completed with the addition of suitable
conjugates and new sets of constraints and their associated Lagrange
multipliers, (iii) special examples of alternative but equivalent formulations
of given first-class constraints, as well as (iv) a comparison of both regular

  interaction</title><description>  A formulation of quantum electrodynamics is given that applies to atoms in a
strong laser field by perturbation theory in a non-relativistic regime. Dipole
approximation is assumed. The dual Dyson series, here discussed by referring it
to the Birkhoff theorem for singularly perturbed linear differential equations,
can be applied and a perturbation series obtained transforming the Hamiltonian
by a Pauli-Fierz transformation. But, if just few photons are present
high-order harmonics cannot be generated. So, it is proven that odd high-order
harmonics only appear when the laser field is intense and one can substitute
the creation and annihilation operators by the square root of the mean number
of photons taken to be huge, the field retaining its coherency property as
observed experimentally for harmonics. In this case, the Hamiltonian for
perturbation theory comes to the Kramers-Henneberger form. The theory has a
dipolar contribution when the free-electron quiver motion amplitude is larger
than the atomic radius. For a Coulomb potential one has that the outer electron
is periodically kicked, and so a prove is given that the same should happen to
Rydberg atoms in intense microwave fields. The distribution representing the
kicking has a Fourier series with just odd terms. Using a modified
Rayleigh-Schr\&quot;odinger perturbation theory, it is shown that under the same
condition of validity of the quiver motion amplitude to atomic radius ratio,
the atomic wave function is only slightly modified by the laser field due to
the way the energy levels rearrange themselves. This gives a prove of
stabilization in the limit of laser frequency going to infinity. Then,
perturbation theory can be applied when the Keldysh parameter becomes smaller
with respect to the shifted distance between the energy levels of the atom.

  Spin</title><description>  The topological nature of Chern-Simons term describing the interaction of a
charge with magnetic monopole is manifested in two ways: it changes the plane
dynamical geometry of a free particle for the cone dynamical geometry without
distorting the free (geodesic) character of the motion, and in the limit of
zero charge's mass it describes a spin system. This observation allows us to
interpret the charge-monopole system alternatively as a free particle of fixed
spin with translational and spin degrees of freedom interacting via the
helicity constraint, or as a symmetric spinning top with dynamical moment of
inertia and &quot;isospin&quot; U(1) gauge symmetry, or as a system with higher
derivatives. The last interpretation is used to get the twistor formulation of
the system. We show that the reparametrization and scale invariant monopole
Chern-Simons term supplied with the kinetic term of the same invariance gives
rise to the alternative description for the spin, which is related to the
charge-monopole system in a spherical geometry. The relationship between the
charge-monopole system and (2+1)-dimensional anyon is discussed in the light of
the obtained results.

  quantum computer</title><description>  Call a spectrum of Hamiltonian sparse if each eigenvalue can be quickly
restored with accuracy $\epsilon$ from its rough approximation in within
$\epsilon_1$ by means of some classical algorithm. It is shown how a behavior
of system with sparse spectrum up to time $T=\frac{1-\rho}{14\epsilon}$ can be
predicted with fidelity $\rho$ on quantum computer in time
$t=\frac{4}{(1-\rho)\epsilon_1}$ plus the time of classical algorithm. The
quantum knowledge of Hamiltonian $H$ eigenvalues is considered as a wizard
Hamiltonian $W_H$ which action on any eigenvector of $H$ gives the
corresponding eigenvalue. Speedup of evolution for systems with sparse spectrum
is possible because for such systems wizard Hamiltonians can be quickly
simulated on a quantum computer. This simulation, generalizing Shor trick, is a
part of presented algorithm.
  In general case the action of wizard Hamiltonian cannot be simulated in time
smaller than the dimension of main space which is exponential of the size of
quantum system. For an arbitrary system (even for classical) its behavior
cannot be predicted on quantum computer even for one step ahead. This method
can be used also for restoration of a state of an arbitrary primary system in
time instant $-T$ in the past with the same fidelity which requires the same
time.

terms of continuous symbols, i.e. by smooth functions on a two-dimensional
sphere. Such prescriptions to associate operators with Wigner functions, P- or
Q-symbols, are conveniently expressed in terms of operator kernels satisfying
the Stratonovich-Weyl postulates. In analogy to this approach, a discrete Moyal
formalism is defined on the basis of a modified set of postulates. It is shown
that appropriately modified postulates single out a well-defined set of kernels
which give rise to discrete symbols. Now operators are represented by functions
taking values on (2s+1)(2s+1) points of the sphere. The discrete symbols
contain no redundant information, contrary to the continuous ones. The
properties of the resulting discrete Moyal formalism for a quantum spin are
worked out in detail and compared to the continuous formalism, and it is
illustrated by the example of a spin 1/2.

Decision Theory and Artificial Intelligence, where inferences are made based on
uncertain knowledge. The class of algorithms that we propose is based on a
construction method that generalizes a Fredkin-Toffoli (F-T) construction
method used in the field of classical reversible computing. F-T showed how,
given any binary deterministic circuit, one can construct another binary
deterministic circuit which does the same calculations in a reversible manner.
We show how, given any classical stochastic network (classical Bayesian net),
one can construct a quantum network (quantum Bayesian net). By running this
quantum Bayesian net on a quantum computer, one can calculate any conditional
probability that one would be interested in calculating for the original
classical Bayesian net. Thus, we generalize the F-T construction method so that
it can be applied to any classical stochastic circuit, not just binary
deterministic ones. We also show that, in certain situations, our class of
algorithms can be combined with Grover's algorithm to great advantage.

which is implemented through a sequence of RF pulses, and via quantum codes
which can protect against incoherent evolution. Here, we discuss the design and
implementation of quantum codes to protect against coherent evolution. A
detailed example is given of a quantum code for protecting two data qubits from
evolution under a weak coupling (Ising) term in the Hamiltonian, using an
``isolated'' ancilla which does not evolve on the experimental time scale. The
code is realized in a three-spin system by liquid-state NMR spectroscopy on
13C-labelled alanine, and tested for two initial states. It is also shown that
for coherent evolution and isolated ancillae, codes exist that do not require
the ancillae to initially be in a (pseudo-)pure state. Finally, it is shown
that even with non-isolated ancillae quantum codes exist which can protect
against evolution under weak coupling. An example is presented for a six qubit
code that protects two data spins to first order.

  Liquid-State NMR Spectroscopy</title><description>  Quantum error correcting codes enable the information contained in a quantum
state to be protected from decoherence due to external perturbations. Applied
to NMR, quantum coding does not alter normal relaxation, but rather converts
the state of a ``data'' spin into multiple quantum coherences involving
additional ancilla spins. These multiple quantum coherences relax at differing
rates, thus permitting the original state of the data to be approximately
reconstructed by mixing them together in an appropriate fashion. This paper
describes the operation of a simple, three-bit quantum code in the product
operator formalism, and uses geometric algebra methods to obtain the
error-corrected decay curve in the presence of arbitrary correlations in the
external random fields. These predictions are confirmed in both the totally
correlated and uncorrelated cases by liquid-state NMR experiments on
13C-labeled alanine, using gradient-diffusion methods to implement these
idealized decoherence models. Quantum error correction in weakly polarized
systems requires that the ancilla spins be prepared in a pseudo-pure state
relative to the data spin, which entails a loss of signal that exceeds any
potential gain through error correction. Nevertheless, this study shows that
quantum coding can be used to validate theoretical decoherence mechanisms, and
to provide detailed information on correlations in the underlying NMR
relaxation dynamics.

Minkowski space-time and its associated geometric algebra, and the insights
this provides into how density operators and entanglement behave under Lorentz
transformations are discussed. The direct sum of multiple copies of space-time
induces a tensor product structure on the associated algebra, in which a
suitable quotient is isomorphic to the matrix algebra conventionally used in
multi-qubit quantum mechanics. Finally, the utility of geometric algebra in
understanding both unitary and nonunitary quantum operations is demonstrated on
several examples of interest in quantum information processing.

various contexts. The question arises whether such effects could be observed
with extremely weak pulses, and what would prevent the observation of an
&quot;optical tachyon.&quot; Aharonov, Reznik, and Stern (ARS) [Phys. Rev. Lett., vol.
81, 2190 (1998)] have argued that quantum noise will preclude the observation
of a superluminal group velocity when the pulse consists of one or a few
photons. In this paper we reconsider this question both in a general framework
and in the specific example, suggested by Chiao, Kozhekin, and Kurizki [Phys.
Rev. Lett., vol. 77, 1254 (1996)], of off-resonant, short-pulse propagation in
an optical amplifier. We derive in the case of the amplifier a signal-to-noise
ratio that is consistent with the general ARS conclusions when we impose their
criteria for distinguishing between superluminal propagation and propagation at
the speed c. However, results consistent with the semiclassical arguments of
CKK are obtained if weaker criteria are imposed, in which case the signal can
exceed the noise without being &quot;exponentially large.&quot; We show that the quantum
fluctuations of the field considered by ARS are closely related to
superfluorescence noise. More generally we consider the implications of
unitarity for superluminal propagation and quantum noise and study, in addition
to the complete and truncated wavepackets considered by ARS, the residual
wavepacket formed by their difference. This leads to the conclusion that the
noise is mostly luminal and delayed with respect to the superluminal signal. In
the limit of a very weak incident signal pulse, the superluminal signal will be
dominated by the noise part, and the signal-to-noise ratio will therefore be
very small.

continuous dynamical evolution of the state vector for a macroscopic object.
Our main concern is to recover the decoupling of the state vector dynamics for
the center-of-mass (CM) and internal motion, as in the GRWP model, but within
the framework of the standard cosmology. In this connection we have taken the
opposite direction of the GRWP argument, that the cosmic background radiation
(CBR) has originated from a fundamental stochastic hitting process. We assume
the CBR as a clue of the Big Bang, playing a main role in the decoupling of the
state vector dynamics of the CM and internal motion. In our model, instead of
describing a continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) of a system of massive
particles as proposed by Ghirardi, Pearle and Rimini, the It\^{o} stochastic
equation accounts for the intervention of the CBR on the system of particles.
Essentially, this approach leads to a pre-master equation for both the CBR and
particles degrees of freedom. The violation of the principle of energy
conservation characteristic of the CSL model is avoided as well as the
additional assumption on the size of the GRWP's localization width necessary to
reach the decoupling between the collective and internal motions. Moreover,
realistic estimation for the decoherence time, exhibiting an interesting
dependence on the CBR temperature, is obtained. From the formula for the
decoherence time it is possible to analyze the transition from micro to macro
dynamics in both the early hot Universe and the nowadays cold one. The entropy
of the system under decoherence is analyzed and the emergent `pointer basis' is
discussed. In spite of not having imposed a privileged basis, in our model the
position still emerges as the preferred observable as in the CSL model.

(DFSs) is examined with particular emphasis on using only physically relevant
interactions. A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of
decoherence-free (noiseless) subsystems in the Markovian regime is derived here
for the first time. A stabilizer formalism for DFSs is then developed which
allows for the explicit understanding of these in their dual role as quantum
error correcting codes. Conditions for the existence of Hamiltonians whose
induced evolution always preserves a DFS are derived within this stabilizer
formalism. Two possible collective decoherence mechanisms arising from
permutation symmetries of the system-bath coupling are examined within this
framework. It is shown that in both cases universal quantum computation which
always preserves the DFS (*natural fault-tolerant computation*) can be
performed using only two-body interactions. This is in marked contrast to
standard error correcting codes, where all known constructions using one or
two-body interactions must leave the codespace during the on-time of the
fault-tolerant gates. A further consequence of our universality construction is
that a single exchange Hamiltonian can be used to perform universal quantum
computation on an encoded space whose asymptotic coding efficiency is unity.
The exchange Hamiltonian, which is naturally present in many quantum systems,
is thus *asymptotically universal*.

deriving the coupling structure of the fields by satisfying a postulate of
local gauge covariance. The gauge principle is generally considered to be
sufficient to define the full structure of gauge-field theories. This paper
contains a critique of this usual point of view: firstly, by emphazising an
gauge theoretic conventionalism which crucially restricts the conceptual role
of the gauge principle and, secondly, by introducing a new generalized
equivalence principle - the identity of inertial and field charge (as
generalizations of inertial and gravitational mass) - in order to give a
conceptual justification for combining the equations of motion of the
matter-fields and the field equations of the interaction-fields.

the energy-momentum comes or to where it goes. Likewise, in the Continuous
Spontaneous Localization (CSL) dynamical collapse model, particles gain energy
on average. In CSL, the usual Schr\&quot;odinger dynamics is altered so that a
randomly fluctuating classical field interacts with quantized particles to
cause wavefunction collapse. In this paper it is shown how to define energy for
the classical field so that the average value of the energy of the field plus
the quantum system {\it is} conserved for the ensemble of collapsing
wavefunctions. While conservation of just the first moment of energy is, of
course, much less than complete conservation of energy, this does support the
idea that the field could provide the conservation law balance when events

The mutual information of the d-compound and entangled states lead to two di

Although it has no effect at classical level, the lack of equivariance makes
the Galilei action inconsistent with the canonical quantization. A Hamiltonian
equivariant action can be obtained by assuming that the inertial parameter in
the extended phase-space is quasi-isotropic. This condition leads naturally to
the Lorentz transformations between moving frames as a particular case of

relating the two additional canonical coordinates to the energy and time. Its

  passage</title><description>  The adiabatic passage scheme for quantum state synthesis, in which atomic
Zeeman coherences are mapped to photon states in an optical cavity, is extended
to the general case of two degenerate cavity modes with orthogonal
polarization. Analytical calculations of the dressed-state structure and Monte
Carlo wave-function simulations of the system dynamics show that, for a
suitably chosen cavity detuning, it is possible to generate states of photon
multiplets that are maximally entangled in polarization. These states display
nonclassical correlations of the type described by Greenberger, Horne, and
Zeilinger (GHZ). An experimental scheme to realize a GHZ measurement using
coincidence detection of the photons escaping from the cavity is proposed. The
correlations are found to originate in the dynamics of the adiabatic passage
and persist even if cavity decay and GHZ state synthesis compete on the same
time scale. Beyond entangled field states, it is also possible to generate
entanglement between photons and the atom by using a different atomic
transition and initial Zeeman state.

indistinguishable in measurement in a given mixed or pure state W, are
investigated in detail algebraicly and geometrically. It is shown that there is
a far-reaching correspondence between the detectable (in W) spectral entities
of the two operators. Twin observables are state-dependently quantum-logically
equivalent, and direct subsystem measurement of one of them ipso facto gives
rise to the indirect (i.e. distant) measurement of the other. Existence of
nontrivial twins requires singularity of W. Systems in thermodynamic
equilibrium do not admit subsystem twins. These observables may enable one to
simplify the matrix representing W.

  Biochemical Thermodynamics</title><description>  Free energy and entropy are examined in detail from the standpoint of
classical thermodynamics. The approach is logically based on the fact that
thermodynamic work is mediated by thermal energy through the tendency for
nonthermal energy to convert spontaneously into thermal energy and for thermal
energy to distribute spontaneously and uniformly within the accessible space.
The fact that free energy is a Second-Law, expendable energy that makes it
possible for thermodynamic work to be done at finite rates is emphasized.
Entropy, as originally defined, is pointed out to be the capacity factor for
thermal energy that is hidden with respect to temperature; it serves to
evaluate the practical quality of thermal energy and to account for changes in
the amounts of latent thermal energies in systems maintained at constant
temperature. A major objective was to clarify the means by which free energy is
transferred and conserved in sequences of biological reactions coupled by
freely diffusible intermediates. In achieving this objective it was found
necessary to distinguish between a 'characteristic free energy' possessed by
all First-Law energies in amounts equivalent to the amounts of the energies
themselves and a 'free energy of concentration' that is intrinsically
mechanical and relatively elusive in that it can appear to be free of First-Law
energy. The findings in this regard serve to clarify the fact that the transfer
of chemical potential energy from one repository to another along sequences of
biological reactions of the above sort occurs through transfer of the First-Law
energy as thermal energy and transfer of the Second-Law energy as free energy
of concentration.

integrals and their applications in physics. The audience is mainly first-year
graduate students, and it is assumed that the reader has a good foundation in
quantum mechanics. No prior exposure to path integrals is assumed, however.
  The path integral is a formulation of quantum mechanics equivalent to the
standard formulations, offering a new way of looking at the subject which is,
arguably, more intuitive than the usual approaches. Applications of path
integrals are as vast as those of quantum mechanics itself, including the
quantum mechanics of a single particle, statistical mechanics, condensed matter
physics and quantum field theory.
  After an introduction including a very brief historical overview of the
subject, we derive a path integral expression for the propagator in quantum
mechanics, including the free particle and harmonic oscillator as examples. We
then discuss a variety of applications, including path integrals in
multiply-connected spaces, Euclidean path integrals and statistical mechanics,
perturbation theory in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory, and
instantons via path integrals.
  For the most part, the emphasis is on explicit calculations in the familiar
setting of quantum mechanics, with some discussion (often brief and schematic)
of how these ideas can be applied to more complicated situations such as field
theory.

a quantum algorithm that finds w in O(2^{n/2}) time. Farhi &amp; Gutmann show that
w can also be found in the same amount time by letting the quantum system
evolve according to a simple Hamiltonian depending only on f. Their system
evolves along a path far from that taken by Grover's original algorithm,
however. The current paper presents an equally simple Hamiltonian matching
Grover's algorithm step for step. The new Hamiltonian is similar in appearance
from that of Farhi &amp; Gutmann, but has some important differences, and provides
new intuition for Grover's algorithm itself. This intuition both contrasts with
and supplements other explanations of Grover's algorithm as a rotation in two
dimensions, and suggests that the Hamiltonian-based approach to quantum
algorithms can provide a useful heuristic for discovering new quantum
algorithms.

to $k$ (for any constant $k$). Trivially, if Alice starts, $O(k\log n)$
communication in $k$ rounds suffices. The lower bound employs a result relating
the relative von Neumann entropy between density matrices to their trace
distance and uses a new measure of information. We also describe a classical
probabilistic $k$ round protocol with communication
$O(n/k\cdot(\log^{(k/2)}n+\log k)+k\log n)$ in which Bob starts the

  Inversion</title><description>  We suggest a procedure for demonstrating quantum coherence and measuring
decoherence times between different fluxoid states of a SQUID by using
``adiabatic inversion'', where one macroscopic fluxoid state is smoothly
transferred into the other, like a spin reversing direction by following a
slowly moving magnetic field. This is accomplished by sweeping an external
applied flux, and depends on a well-defined quantum phase between the two
macroscopic states. Varying the speed of the sweep relative to the decoherence
time permits one to move from the quantum regime, where such a well-defined
phase exists, to the classical regime where it is lost and the inversion is
inhibited. Thus observing whether inversion has taken place or not as a
function of sweep speed offers the possibility of measuring the decoherence
time. The main requirement for the feasibility of the scheme appears to be that
the low temperature relaxation time among the quantum levels of the SQUID be
long compared to other time scales of the problem.
 Applications to the ``quantum computer'', with the level system of the SQUID
playing the role of the qbit, are briefly discussed.

Ideas and instrumentation from liquid state NMR spectroscopy have been used to

liquid state NMR is the only present-day technology about to reach this number

condition, or equivalent, all derivations make an identical mathematical
assumption: that local hidden-variable theories produce a set of
positive-definite probabilities for detecting a particle with a given spin
orientation. The standard argument is that because quantum mechanics assumes
that particles are emitted in a superposition of states the theory cannot
produce such a set of probabilities. We examine a paper by Eberhard, and
several similar papers, which claim to show that a generalized Bell inequality,
the CHSH inequality, can be derived solely on the basis of the locality
condition, without recourse to hidden variables. We point out that these
authors nonetheless assumes a set of positive-definite probabilities, which
supports the claim that hidden variables or &quot;locality&quot; is not at issue here,
positive-definite probabilities are. We demonstrate that quantum mechanics does
predict a set of probabilities that violate the CHSH inequality; however these
probabilities are not positive-definite. Nevertheless, they are physically
meaningful in that they give the usual quantum-mechanical predictions in
physical situations. We discuss in what sense our results are related to the
Wigner distribution.

MKC have nullified the Kochen-Specker theorem strictly so-called, there are
other, related propositions which are not nullified. The argument given is an
elaboration of some of Mermin's critical remarks. Although MKC allow for the
fact that the observables to be measured cannot be precisely specified, they
continue to assume that the observables which are actually measured are
strictly commuting. As Mermin points out, this assumption is unjustified.
Consequently, the analysis of MKC is incomplete. To make it complete one needs
to investigate the predictions their models make regarding approximate joint
measurements of non-commuting observables. Such an investigation is carried
out, using methods previously developed in connection with approximate joint

states. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for such operators to be
optimal, i.e. to detect entangled states in an optimal way. We show how to
optimize general EW, and then we particularize our results to the
non-decomposable ones; the latter are those that can detect positive partial
transpose entangled states (PPTES). We also present a method to systematically
construct and optimize this last class of operators based on the existence of
``edge'' PPTES, i.e. states that violate the range separability criterion
[Phys. Lett. A{\bf 232}, 333 (1997)] in an extreme manner. This method also
permits the systematic construction of non-decomposable positive maps (PM). Our
results lead to a novel sufficient condition for entanglement in terms of
non-decomposable EW and PM. Finally, we illustrate our results by constructing
optimal EW acting on $H=\C^2\otimes \C^4$. The corresponding PM constitute the
first examples of PM with minimal ``qubit'' domain, or - equivalently - minimal
hermitian conjugate codomain.

realistic isolated quantum computer with fluctuations in individual qubit
energies and residual short-range inter-qubit couplings. It is shown that in
the limit where the fluctuations and couplings are small compared to one-qubit
energy spacing the spectrum has a band structure and a renormalized Hamiltonian
is obtained which describes the eigenstate properties inside one band. The
studies are concentrated on the central band of the computer (``core'') with
the highest density of states. We show that above a critical inter-qubit
coupling strength, quantum chaos sets in, leading to quantum ergodicity of the
computer eigenstates. In this regime the ideal qubit structure disappears, the
eigenstates become complex and the operability of the computer is quickly
destroyed. We confirm that the quantum chaos border decreases only linearly
with the number of qubits n, although the spacing between multi-qubit states
drops exponentially with n. The investigation of time-evolution in the quantum
computer shows that in the quantum chaos regime, an ideal (noninteracting)
state quickly disappears and exponentially many states become mixed after a
short chaotic time scale for which the dependence on system parameters is
determined. Below the quantum chaos border an ideal state can survive for long
times and be used for computation. The results show that a broad parameter
region does exist where the efficient operation of a quantum computer is
possible.

effectively controlled even by a weak and slow varying in time electromagnetic
signal if to adapt specially its shape to a particular system. During an
under-barrier motion of a particle such signal provides a &quot;coherent&quot; assistance
of tunneling by the multi-quanta absorption resulting in a strong enhancement
of the tunneling probability. The semiclassical approach based on trajectories
in the complex time is developed for tunneling in a non-stationary field.
Enhancement of tunneling occurs when a singularity of the signal coincides in
position at the complex time plane with a singularity of the classical
Newtonian trajectory of the particle. The developed theory is also applicable
to the over-barrier reflection of particles and to reflection of classical

be understood by a combination of an {\it asymmetrically-decohered} quantum

asymmetrically-decohered quantum channel, we find some counter-intuitive
results; one is that teleportation does not necessarily get better as the
channel is initially squeezed more and another is when one branch of the
quantum channel is unavoidably subject to some imperfect operations, blindly
making the other branch as clean as possible may not result in the best
teleportation result. We find the optimum strategy to teleport an unknown field

  Feasibility</title><description>  The Penrose-Hameroff (`Orch OR') model of quantum computation in brain
microtubules has been criticized as regards the issue of environmental
decoherence. A recent report by Tegmark finds that microtubules can maintain
quantum coherence for only $10^{-13}$ s, far too short to be
neurophysiologically relevant. Here, we critically examine the assumptions
behind Tegmark's calculation and find that: 1) Tegmark's commentary is not
aimed at an existing model in the literature but rather at a hybrid that
replaces the superposed protein conformations of the `Orch OR' theory with a
soliton in superposition along the microtubule, 2) Tegmark predicts decreasing
decoherence times at lower temperature, in direct contradiction of the observed
behavior of quantum states, 3) recalculation after correcting Tegmark's
equation for differences between his model and the `Orch OR' model
(superposition separation, charge vs. dipole, dielectric constant) lengthens
the decoherence time to $10^{-5} - 10^{-4}$ s and invalidates a critical
assumption of Tegmark's derivation, 4) incoherent metabolic energy supplied to
the collective dynamics ordering water in the vicinity of microtubules at a
rate exceeding that of decoherence can counter decoherence effects (in the same
way that lasers avoid decoherence at room temperature), and 5) phases of actin
gelation may enhance the ordering of water around microtubule bundles, further
increasing the decoherence-free zone by an order of magnitude and the
decoherence time to $10^{-2} - 10^{-1}$ s. These revisions bring microtubule
decoherence into a regime in which quantum gravity can interact with
neurophysiology.

as the product of elements respectively in the left and right ideals of an

two representation independent algebraic forms in terms of the density and
phase operators. These forms are respectively the continuity equation, which
involves the commutator of the Hamiltonian with the density operator, and an
equation for the time development of the phase operator that involves the
anti-commutator of the Hamiltonian with this density operator. We show that
this latter equation plays two important roles: (i) it expresses the
conservation of energy in a system where energy is well defined and (ii) it
provides a simple way to evaluate the gauge changes that occur in the
Aharonov-Bohm, the Aharonov-Casher, and Berry phase effects. Both these
operator (i.e. purely algebraic) equations also allow us to re-examine the Bohm
interpretation, showing that it is in fact possible to construct Bohm
interpretations in representations other than the x-representation. We discuss
the meaning of the Bohm interpretation in the light of these new results in
terms of non-commutative structures and this enables us to clarify its relation

to the classical observables p cos(phi), -p sin(phi) and p &gt; 0 the Poisson
brackets of which obey that Lie algebra, too. For the irreducible unitary
representations of the positive series the modulus operator K_3 has the
positive discrete spectrum {n+k, n=0,1,2,...; k &gt; 0}. Self-adjoint operators
for cos(phi) and sin(phi) can then be defined as (K_3^{-1}K_1 + K_1 K_3^{-1})/2
and - (K_3^{-1} K_2 + K_2 K_3^{-1})/2 which have the theoretically desired

processing. It is a natural question which type of protocols is more powerful.
We prove for general states but under the assumption of incoherent
eavesdropping that Alice and Bob share some so-called intrinsic information in
their classical random variables, resulting from optimal measurements, if and
only if the parties' quantum systems are entangled. In addition, we provide
evidence that the potentials of classical and of quantum protocols are equal in
every situation. Consequently, many techniques and results from quantum
information theory directly apply to problems in classical information theory,
and vice versa. For instance, it was previously believed that two parties can
carry out unconditionally secure key agreement as long as they share some
intrinsic information in the adversary's view. The analysis of this purely
classical problem from the quantum information-theoretic viewpoint shows that
this is true in the binary case, but false in general. More explicitly, bound
entanglement, i.e., entanglement that cannot be purified by any quantum
protocol, has a classical counterpart. This &quot;bound intrinsic information&quot;
cannot be distilled to a secret key by any classical protocol. As another
application we propose a measure for entanglement based on classical
information-theoretic quantities.

in near-optical linearly polarized laser fields with intensities of order 10^16
to 10^17 W/cm^2. Depending on the charge state Z of the ion the relation of
strength between laser field and ionic core changes. We find around Z=12
typical multiphoton dynamics and for Z=3 tunneling behaviour, however with
clear relativistic signatures. In first order in v/c the magnetic field
component of the laser field induces a Z-dependent drift in the laser
propagation direction and a substantial Z-dependent angular momentum with
repect to the ionic core. While spin oscillations occur already in first order
in v/c as described by the Pauli equation, spin induced forces via spin orbit
coupling only appear in the parameter regime where (v/c)^2 corrections are
significant. In this regime for Z=12 ions we show strong splittings of resonant
spectral lines due to spin-orbit coupling and substantial corrections to the
conventional Stark shift due to the relativistic mass shift while those to the
Darwin term are shown to be small. For smaller charges or higher laser
intensities, parts of the electronic wavepacket may tunnel through the
potential barrier of the ionic core, and when recombining are shown to give
rise to keV harmonics in the radiation spectrum. Some parts of the wavepacket
do not recombine after ionisation and we find very energetic electrons in the

between its good and bad elements, where $x$ is good if $\chi(x)=1$ and bad
otherwise. Consider also a quantum algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $A
|0\rangle= \sum_{x\in X} \alpha_x |x\rangle$ is a quantum superposition of the
elements of $X$, and let $a$ denote the probability that a good element is
produced if $A |0\rangle$ is measured. If we repeat the process of running $A$,
measuring the output, and using $\chi$ to check the validity of the result, we
shall expect to repeat $1/a$ times on the average before a solution is found.
*Amplitude amplification* is a process that allows to find a good $x$ after an
expected number of applications of $A$ and its inverse which is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{a}$, assuming algorithm $A$ makes no measurements. This is a
generalization of Grover's searching algorithm in which $A$ was restricted to
producing an equal superposition of all members of $X$ and we had a promise
that a single $x$ existed such that $\chi(x)=1$. Our algorithm works whether or
not the value of $a$ is known ahead of time. In case the value of $a$ is known,
we can find a good $x$ after a number of applications of $A$ and its inverse
which is proportional to $1/\sqrt{a}$ even in the worst case. We show that this
quadratic speedup can also be obtained for a large family of search problems
for which good classical heuristics exist. Finally, as our main result, we
combine ideas from Grover's and Shor's quantum algorithms to perform amplitude
estimation, a process that allows to estimate the value of $a$. We apply
amplitude estimation to the problem of *approximate counting*, in which we wish
to estimate the number of $x\in X$ such that $\chi(x)=1$. We obtain optimal
quantum algorithms in a variety of settings.

non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the teleportation of an unknown state of
the quantum field cannot be in principle described in terms of a measurement in
a tensor product of two Hilbert spaces to which the unknown state and the state
of the EPR-pair belong. The reason is of the existence of a cyclic (vacuum)
state common to both the unknown state and the EPR-pair. Due to the common
vacuum vector and the microcausality principle (commutation relations for the
field operators), the teleportation amplitude contains inevitably contributions
which are irrelevant to the teleportation process. Hence in the relativistic
theory the teleportation in the sense it is understood in the non-relativistic
quantum mechanics proves to be impossible because of the impossibility of the
realization of the appropriate measurement as a tensor product of the
measurements related to the individual subsystems so that one can only speak of
the amplitude of the propagation of the field as a whole.

relativistic state is considered. Analysis of the relativistic case reveals
that the teleportation as it is understood in the non-relativistic quantum
mechanics is impossible if no {\it a priori} information on the state to be
teleported is available. It is only possible to speak of the amplitude of the
propagation of the field (taking into account the measurement procedure) since
the existence of a common vacuum state together with the microcausality
principle (the field operators commutation relations) make the concept of the
propagation amplitude for the individual subsystems physically meaningless.
When partial {\it a priori} information is available (for example, only the
polarization state of the photon is unknown while its spatial state is
specified beforehand), the teleportation does become possible in the
relativistic case. In that case the {\it a priori} information can be used to
``label'' the identical particles to make them effectively distinguishable.

the dielectric function of the metallization has to be directly measured to

this function one can establish a well defined upper limit on the force using

The force measured with the microscope is larger than the upper limit at small

applied to canonical quantum gravity. It is shown that, irrespective of any
regularization or choice of factor ordering of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, the
unique relevant quantum effect which does not break spacetime is the change of
its signature from lorentzian to euclidean. The other quantum effects are
either trivial or break the four-geometry of spacetime. A Bohm-de Broglie
picture of quantum geometrodynamics is constructed, which allows the
investigation of these latter structures. For instance, it is shown that any
real solution of the Wheeler-De Witt equation yields a generate four-geometry
compatible with the strong gravity limit of General Relativity and the Carroll

introduce our metodology, we study the quantum theory of fields in Minkowski
spacetime in the Bohm-de Broglie interpretation and exhibit a concrete example
where Lorentz invariance of individual events is broken.

  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen nonlocality puzzle</title><description>  The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen nonlocality puzzle has been recognized as one of
the most important unresolved issues in the foundational aspects of quantum
mechanics. We show that the problem is resolved if the quantum correlations are
calculated directly from local quantities which preserve the phase information
in the quantum system. We assume strict locality for the probability amplitudes
instead of local realism for the outcomes, and calculate an amplitude
correlation function.Then the experimentally observed correlation of outcomes
is calculated from the square of the amplitude correlation function. Locality
of amplitudes implies that the measurement on one particle does not collapse
the companion particle to a definite state. Apart from resolving the EPR
puzzle, this approach shows that the physical interpretation of apparently
`nonlocal' effects like quantum teleportation and entanglement swapping are
different from what is usually assumed. Bell type measurements do not change
distant states. Yet the correlations are correctly reproduced, when measured,
if complex probability amplitudes are treated as the basic local quantities. As
examples we discuss the quantum correlations of two-particle maximally
entangled states and the three-particle GHZ entangled state.

an additional contribution to the usual Newtonian gravitational potential, is
introduced. The central idea is to analyze the effects at quantum level
employing interference patterns (at this respect the present proposal resembles
the Colella, Overhauser and Werner experiment), and deduce from it the possible
effects that this Yukawa term could have. We will prove that the corresponding
interference pattern depends on the phenomenological parameters that define
this kind of terms. Afterwards, using the so called restricted path integral
formalism, the case of a particle whose position is being continuously
monitored, is analyzed, and the effects that this Yukawa potential could have
on the measurement outputs are obtained. This allows us to obtain another
scheme that could lead to the detection of these terms. This last part also
renders new theoretical predictions that could enable us to confront the
restricted path integral formalism against some future experiments.

dust ball from an initial density profile which is physically reasonable. We
show that explosive radiation is emitted during the formation process of the
naked singularity. The energy flux is proportional to $(t_{\rm CH}-t)^{-3/2}$
for a minimally coupled massless scalar field, while is proportional to
$(t_{\rm CH}-t)^{-1}$ for a conformally coupled massless scalar field, where
$t_{\rm CH}-t$ is the `remained time' until the distant observer could observe
the singularity if the naked singularity was formed. As a consequence, the
radiated energy grows unboundedly for both scalar fields. The amount of the
power and the energy depends on parameters which characterize the initial
density profile but do not depend on the gravitational mass of the cloud. In
particular, there is characteristic frequency $\nu_{s}$ of singularity above
which the divergent energy is radiated. The energy flux is dominated by
particles of which the wave length is about $t_{\rm CH}-t$ at each moment. The
observed total spectrum is nonthermal, i.e., $\nu dN/d\nu \sim
(\nu/\nu_{s})^{-1}$ for $\nu&gt;\nu_{s}$. If the naked singularity formation could
continue until a considerable fraction of the total energy of the dust cloud is
radiated, the radiated energy would reach about $10^{54}(M/M_{\odot})$ erg. The
calculations are based on the geometrical optics approximation which turns out
to be consistent as a rough order estimate. The analysis does not depend on
whether or not the naked singularity occurs in its exact meaning. This
phenomenon may provide a new candidate for a source of ultra high energy cosmic
rays or a central engine of gamma ray bursts.

that these states cannot be used to transmit more classical bits than the
number of qubits used, yet there are ways of conveying information with
exponentially fewer qubits than possible classically. Moreover, these methods
have a very simple structure---they involve little interaction between the
communicating parties. We look more closely at the ways in which information
encoded in quantum states may be manipulated, and consider the question as to
whether every classical protocol may be transformed to a ``simpler'' quantum
protocol of similar efficiency. By a simpler protocol, we mean a protocol that
uses fewer message exchanges. We show that for any constant k, there is a
problem such that its k+1 message classical communication complexity is
exponentially smaller than its k message quantum communication complexity, thus
answering the above question in the negative. Our result builds on two
primitives, local transitions in bi-partite states (based on previous work) and
average encoding which may be of significance in other applications as well.

problem of finding appropriate ways of thinking about the spatial and temporal
aspects of the physical world. The standard, substantival, set-theoretic
conception of space is inconsistent with quantum mechanics, and so is the
doctrine of local realism, the principle of local causality, and the
mathematical physicist's golden calf, determinism. The said problem is made
intractable by our obtruding onto the physical world a theoretical framework
that is more detailed than the physical world. This framework portraits space
and time as infinitely and intrinsically differentiated, whereas the physical
world is only finitely differentiated spacewise and timewise, namely to the
extent that spatiotemporal relations and distinctions are warranted by facts.
This has the following consequences: (i) The contingent properties of the
physical world, including the times at which they are possessed, are indefinite
and extrinsic. (ii) We cannot think of reality as being built &quot;from the bottom
up&quot;, out of locally instantiated physical properties. Instead we must conceive
of the physical world as being built &quot;from the top down&quot;: By entering into a
multitude of spatial relations with itself, &quot;existence itself&quot; takes on both
the aspect of a spatially differentiated world and the aspect of a multiplicity
of formless relata, the fundamental particles. At the root of our
interpretational difficulties is the &quot;cookie cutter paradigm&quot;, according to
which the world's synchronic multiplicity is founded on the introduction of
surfaces that carve up space in the manner of three-dimensional cookie cutters.
The neurophysiological underpinnings of this insidious notion are discussed.

equivalence classes in the set of entangled states. This classification
concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state.
Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both
of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and
classical communcication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure
states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two
inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the GHZ state
and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that
the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three
qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher
dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems, for all of which
we show that, typically, two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted
into each other by means of LOCC, not even with a small probability of success.

investigated in many different physical settings. The full set of requirements
that must be met to make quantum computing a reality in the laboratory [1] is
daunting, involving capabilities well beyond the present state of the art. In
this report we develop a significant simplification of these requirements that
can be applied in many recent solid-state approaches, using quantum dots [2],
and using donor-atom nuclear spins [3] or electron spins [4]. In these
approaches, the basic two-qubit quantum gate is generated by a tunable
Heisenberg interaction (the Hamiltonian is $H_{ij}=J(t){\vec S}_i\cdot{\vec
S}_j$ between spins $i$ and $j$), while the one-qubit gates require the control
of a local Zeeman field. Compared to the Heisenberg operation, the one-qubit
operations are significantly slower and require substantially greater materials
and device complexity, which may also contribute to increasing the decoherence
rate. Here we introduce an explicit scheme in which the Heisenberg interaction
alone suffices to exactly implement any quantum computer circuit, at a price of
a factor of three in additional qubits and about a factor of ten in additional
two-qubit operations. Even at this cost, the ability to eliminate the
complexity of one-qubit operations should accelerate progress towards these
solid-state implementations of quantum computation.

be correlated even at distances exceeding the local cosmological horizon. By

standard form, enumerating ``local invariants,'' and using operational
quantities such as the number of maximally entangled states which can be
distilled. In this paper we evaluate a particular standard form, the {\it
Schmidt form}, which is a generalization of the Schmidt decomposition for
bipartite pure states. We show how the coefficients in this case can be
parametrized in terms of five physically meaningful local invariants; we use
this form to prove the efficacy of a particular distillation technique for GHZ

  Our basic idea is to distinguish the dynamical entropy of von Neumann, $H =

and the statistical amount of uncertainty of Shannon, $S= -k \sum_{n}p_{n}\ln
p_{n}$, with $p_{n}=&lt; n|\hat{\rho}|n&gt;$ in the representation where the total
energy and particle numbers are diagonal. These quantities satisfy the
inequality $S\geq H$. We propose to interprete Shannon's statistical inference
as specifying the {\em initial conditions} of the system in terms of $p_{n}$. A
definition of macroscopic observables which are characterized by intrinsic time
scales is given, and a quantum mechanical condition on the system, which
ensures equilibrium, is discussed on the basis of time averaging.
  An interesting analogy of the change of entroy with the running coupling in

the ancilla responds to fluctuations on a much shorter time scale than does the
system, we show that it can be adiabatically eliminated, yielding a master
equation for the system alone. This is very significant as it decreases the
necessary basis size for numerical simulation and allows the effect of the
ancilla to be understood more easily. We consider two types of ancilla: a
two-level ancilla (e.g. a two-level atom) and an infinite-level ancilla (e.g.
an optical mode). For each, we consider two forms of feedback: coherent (for
which a quantum mechanical description of the feedback loop is required) and
incoherent (for which a classical description is sufficient). We test the
master equations we obtain using numerical simulation of the full dynamics of
the compound system. For the system (a parametric oscillator) and feedback
(intensity-dependent detuning) we choose, good agreement is found in the limit
of heavy damping of the ancilla. We discuss the relation of our work to
previous work on feedback in compound quantum systems, and also to previous

interferometers to be constructed to compute particular problems. A standard
formalism for constructing the arms has been developed by the extension of
classical reversible gate arrays. By its nature of sequential applications of
logic operations, the required number of gates increases exponentially as the
problem size grows. This may cause a crucial obstacle to perform a quantum
computation within a limited decoherence time. We propose a direct and
concurrent construction of the interferometer arms by one-time evolution of a
physical system with arbitrary multi-particle interactions. It is inherently
quantum mechanical and has no classical analogue. Encoding the functions used

interaction in a medium and using the resonant approximation for the two
degenerated states of an electron in a monochromatic radiation field [1] a
nonperturbative solution of the Dirac equation (nonlinear over field solution
of the Hill type equation) are obtained. The multiphoton cross sections of
electrons coherent scattering on the plane monochromatic wave at the Cherenkov
resonance are obtained taking into account the specificity of induced Cherenkov
process [1, 2] and spin-laser interaction as well. In the result of this
resonant scattering the electron beam quantum modulation at high frequencies
occurs that corresponds to a quantity of an electron energy exchange at the
coherent reflection from the ''phase lattice'' of slowed plane wave in a
medium. So, we can expect to have a coherent X-ray source in induced Cherenkov
process, since such beam is a potential source of coherent radiation itself.

We consider a collection of pure states and seek a positive operator-valued

closest in squared norm to the given states. We compare our results to previous
measurements suggested by Peres and Wootters [Phys. Rev. Lett. 66, 1119 (1991)]

latter as the square-root measurement (SRM). We obtain a new characterization
of the SRM, and prove that it is optimal in a least-squares sense. In addition,
we show that for a geometrically uniform state set the SRM minimizes the
probability of a detection error. This generalizes a similar result of Ban et
al. [Int. J. Theor. Phys. 36, 1269 (1997)].

(QFT). We give an upper bound of O(log n + log log (1/epsilon)) on the circuit
depth for computing an approximation of the QFT with respect to the modulus 2^n
with error bounded by epsilon. Thus, even for exponentially small error, our
circuits have depth O(log n). The best previous depth bound was O(n), even for
approximations with constant error. Moreover, our circuits have size O(n log
(n/epsilon)). We also give an upper bound of O(n (log n)^2 log log n) on the
circuit size of the exact QFT modulo 2^n, for which the best previous bound was
O(n^2).
  As an application of the above depth bound, we show that Shor's factoring
algorithm may be based on quantum circuits with depth only O(log n) and
polynomial-size, in combination with classical polynomial-time pre- and
post-processing. In the language of computational complexity, this implies that
factoring is in the complexity class ZPP^BQNC, where BQNC is the class of
problems computable with bounded-error probability by quantum circuits with
poly-logarithmic depth and polynomial size.
  Finally, we prove an Omega(log n) lower bound on the depth complexity of
approximations of the QFT with constant error. This implies that the above
upper bound is asymptotically optimal (for a reasonable range of values of
epsilon).

  Einstein-Podolksy-Rosen experiments</title><description>  Conventionally, one interprets the correlations observed in
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments by Bell's inequalities and quantum
nonlocality. We show, in this paper, that identical correlations arise, if the
phase relations of electromagnetic fields are considered. In particular, we
proceed from an analysis of a one-photon model. The correlation probability in
this case contains a phase relation cos(b - a) between the two settings. In the
two photon model the phases of the photon's electromagnetic fields are related
at the origin. It is shown that this relation can be translated into a
linearity requirement for electromagnetic fields between the two polarizers.
Along these lines we compute the correlation integral with an expression
conserving linearity. This expression, as shown, correctly describes the
measured values. It seems thus that quantum nonlocality can be seen as a
combination of boundary conditions on possible electromagnetic fields between
the polarizers and a relation of the electromagnetic fields of the two photons
via a phase. We expect the same feature to arise in every experiment, where
joint probabilities of separate polarization measurements are determined.

two-photon Raman resonance in a three-level $\Lambda$-scheme, additional dips
detuned from the main dip by a frequency equal to the frequency of the HF

increase in the medium transparency at frequencies corresponding to the
three-photon Raman resonances in four-level N-type schemes. The resonance

efficiency in estimation is possible using non-separable, as opposed to
separable, measurements of N copies of m-level quantum systems. First, we study
the six cases m = 2, N = 2,...,7 by computing the the 3 x 3 Fisher information
matrices for the corresponding optimal measurements recently devised by Vidal

expressions for the (&quot;Gill-Massar&quot;) traces of the products of the inverse of
the quantum Helstrom information matrix and these Fisher information matrices.
The six traces all have minima of 2 N -1 in the pure state limit, while for
separable measurements (quant-ph/9902063), the traces can equal N, but not
exceed it. Then, the result of an analysis for m = 3, N = 2 leads us to
conjecture that for optimal measurements for all m and N, the &quot;Gill-Massar

QTR{em}{x(t)} for the particle that is consistent with this PDF. The trajectory
is unique to within an additive constant corresponding to an initial condition
QTR{em}{x(0).} However the value of QTR{em}{x(0)} cannot be known. As an
example, a free particle in its ground state in a box of length QTR{em}{L}
obeys a classical trajectory QTR{em}{x/L - (1/2}$pi)sin (2pi x/L)+t_{0}=t.$ The
constant QTR{em}{t}$_{0}$ is an unknowable time displacement. Momentum values,
however, cannot be determined by merely differentiating QTR{em}{d/dt} the

Heisenberg's. This permits position and momentum to remain complementary

ways: either as `strongly objective,' that is, all correlation functions
pertain to the same set of particle pairs, or as `weakly objective,' that is,
each correlation function pertains to a different set of particle pairs.
  It is demonstrated that once this meaning is determined, no discrepancy
appears between local realistic theories and quantum mechanics: the discrepancy
in Bell's Theorem is due only to a meaningless comparison between a local
realistic inequality written within the strongly objective interpretation (thus
relevant to a single set of particle pairs) and a quantum mechanical prediction
derived from a weakly objective interpretation (thus relevant to several
different sets of particle pairs).

optical resonators by the mechanical forces associated with single photons
[Hood et al., Science 287, 1447 (2000) and Pinkse et al., Nature 404, 365
(2000)]. Here we analyze the trapping dynamics in these settings, focusing on
two points of interest. Firstly, we investigate the extent to which
light-induced forces in these experiments are distinct from their free-space
counterparts. Secondly, we explore the quantitative features of the resulting
atomic motion and how these dynamics are mapped onto variations of the
intracavity field. Not surprisingly, qualitatively distinct atomic dynamics
arise as the coupling and dissipative rates are varied. For the experiment of
Hood et al., we show that atomic motion is largely conservative and is
predominantly in radial orbits transverse to the cavity axis. A comparison with
the free-space theory demonstrates that the fluctuations of the dipole force
are suppressed by an order of magnitude. This effect is based upon the
Jaynes-Cummings eigenstates of the atom-cavity system and represents
qualitatively new physics for optical forces at the single-photon level. By
contrast, even in a regime of strong coupling in the experiment of Pinkse et
al., there are only small quantitative distinctions between the free-space
theory and the quantum theory, so it is not clear that description of this
experiment as a novel single-quantum trapping effect is necessary. The atomic
motion is strongly diffusive, leading to an average localization time
comparable to the time for an atom to transit freely through the cavity and to
a reduction in the ability to infer aspects of the atomic motion from the
intracavity photon number.

consequences of our investigation is that the existence of probability
distributions of the Kolmogorov-type which was supposed by some authors is a
mathematical assumption which may not be supported by actual physical quantum
processes. In fact, frequencies for hidden variables for quantum particles and
measurement devices may fluctuate from run to run of an experiment. These
fluctuations of frequencies for micro-parameters need not contradict to the
stabilization of frequencies for physical observables. If, nevertheless,
micro-parameters are also statistically stable, then violations of Bell's
inequality and its generalizations may be a consequence of dependence of
collectives corresponding to two different measurement devices. Such a
dependence implies the violation of the factorization rule for the simultaneous
probability distribution. Formally this rule coincides with the well known BCHS
locality condition (or outcome independence condition). However, the frequency
approach implies totally different interpretation of dependence. It is not
dependence of events, but it is dependence of collectives. Such a dependence
may be induced by the same preparation procedure.

of the use of Kolmogorov's probabilistic model. By using von Mises' frequency
approach we escape the contradiction between the local realism and quantum
formalism. The frequency approach implies automatically contextual
interpretation of quantum formalism: different collectives induce different
probability distributions. On the other hand, the formal use of Kolmogorov's
model implies the identification of such distributions with one abstract
Kolmogorov measure. In the measure-theoretical approach we can escape the
paradox, if we do not suppose that probability distributions corresponding to
different settings of measurement devices are equivalent. We discuss the
connection between equivalence/singularity dichotomy in measure theory and the
existence of compatible and noncompatible observables.

of gravitation is becoming increasingly accessible to terrestrial experiments
and observations. In this essay we study the emerging indications of the
violation of equivalence principle (VEP). While the solar neutrino anomaly may
find its natural explanation in a VEP, the statistically significant
discrepancy observed in the gravitationally induced phases of neutron
interferometry seems to be the first indication of a VEP. However, such a view
would seem immediately challenged by the atomic interferometry results. The
latter experiments see no indications of VEP, in apparent contradiction to the
neutron interferometry results. Here we present arguments that support the view
that these, and related torsion pendulum experiments, probe different aspects
of gravity; and that current experimental techniques, when coupled to the
solar-neutrino data, may be able to explore quantum mechanically induced
violations of the equivalence principle. We predict quantum violation of the
equivalence principle (qVEP) for next generation of atomic interferometry
experiments. The prediction entails comparing free fall of two different linear
superpositions of Cesium atomic states.

  presence of dispersing and absorbing dielectric bodies</title><description>  A general theory of the interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field
with atoms in the presence of dispersing and absorbing dielectric bodies of
given Kramers--Kronig consistent permittivities is developed. It is based on a
source-quantity representation of the electromagnetic field, in which the
electromagnetic-field operators are expressed in terms of a continuous set of
fundamental bosonic fields via the Green tensor of the classical problem.
Introducing scalar and vector potentials, the formalism is extended in order to
include in the theory the interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field
with additional atoms. Both the minimal-coupling scheme and the
multipolar-coupling scheme are considered. The theory replaces the standard
concept of mode decomposition which fails for complex permittivities. It
enables us to treat the effects of dispersion and absorption in a consistent
way and to give a unified approach to the atom-field interaction, without any
restriction to a particular interaction regime in a particular frequency range.
All relevant information about the dielectric bodies such as form and intrinsic
dispersion and absorption is contained in the Green tensor. The application of
the theory to the spontaneous decay of an excited atom in the presence of
dispersing and absorbing bodies is addressed.

absorbing dielectric four-port devices [L.~Kn\&quot;oll, S.~Scheel, E.~Schmidt,
D.-G.~Welsch, and A.V.~Chizhov, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 59}, 4716 (1999)], we
calculate the quantum state of the outgoing modes of a two-mode squeezed vacuum
transmitted through optical fibers of given extinction coefficients. Using the
Peres--Horodecki separability criterion for continuous variable systems
[R.~Simon, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 84}, 2726 (2000)], we compute the maximal
length of transmission of a two-mode squeezed vacuum through an absorbing
system for which the transmitted state is still inseparable. Further, we
calculate the maximal gain for which inseparability can be observed in an
amplifying setup. Finally, we estimate an upper bound of the entanglement
preserved after transmission through an absorbing system. The results show that
the characteristic length of entanglement degradation drastically decreases
with increasing strength of squeezing.

of these functions which admit a separation into a superposition of an incident

forward direction. It thus appears to be impossible to express the conservation
of probability by means of an optical theorem of the usual kind. Both the total

address these difficulties we find a new representation for the asymptotic form

quasimode. The effect of the thermal cavity fields on the quantum decoherence
of the superposition states of the exciton is studied and it is observed that
the higher the temperature of the environment is, the shorter the decoherence
characteristic time is.

derived for quantum operations on a single qubit prepared in a uniformly
distributed pure state. The derivation is valid for a class of measures
quantifying the state disturbance and the information gain which satisfy
certain invariance conditions. This class includes in particular the Shannon
entropy versus the operation fidelity. The central role in the derivation is
played by efficient quantum operations, which leave the system in a pure output
state for any measurement outcome. It is pointed out that the optimality of
efficient quantum operations among those inducing a given operator-valued
measure is related to Davies' characterization of convex invariant functions on
hermitian operators.

  apparent paradox</title><description>  An apparent paradox is resolved that concerns the existence of time operators
which have been derived for the quantum harmonic oscillator. There is an
apparent paradox because, although a time operator is canonically conjugate to
the Hamiltonian, it has been asserted that no operator exists that is
canonically conjugate to the Hamiltonian. In order to resolve the apparent
paradox, we work in a representation where the phase operator is diagonal. The
boundary condition on wave functions is such that they be periodic in the phase
variable, which is related to the (continuous) eigenvalue of the time operator.
Matrix elements of the commutator of the time operator with the Hamiltonian
involve the phase variable itself in addition to periodic functions of the
phase variable. The Hamiltonian is not hermitian when operating in space that
includes the phase variable itself. The apparent paradox is resolved when this
non-hermeticity is taken into account correctly in the evaluation of matrix
elements of the commutation relation.

which connects F with a given fixed frame F_0. If F is a quantum frame, defined
by a physical object following the laws of quantum physics, the parameters of g
have to be considered as quantum observables. However, these observables are
not compatible and some of them, namely the coordinates of the origin of F,
cannot be represented by self-adjoint operators. Both these difficulties can be
overcome by considering a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) on P,
covariant with respect to the left translations of the group, namely a
covariance system. We develop a construction procedure for this kind of
mathematical structure. The formalism is also used to discuss the quantum
observables measured with respect to a quantum reference frame.

special future final boundary condition for the universe. Although this is an
extension of the way boundary conditions are usually chosen (in terrestrial
laboratories), it is our only deviation from standard quantum mechanics. Using
two state vectors, or the &quot;two-state&quot;, to describe completely the state of
systems of interest, we analyze ideal and &quot;weak&quot; measurements, and show the
consistency of our scheme. If the final state of a measuring device is assigned
to be one of the possible outcomes of the measurement, an effective reduction
is observed after an ideal measurement process. For final conditions chosen
with an appropriate distribution, the predictions of standard quantum mechanics
may be reconstructed, thus eliminating probability from the description of any
single measurement. The interpretation attained, the Teleological
Interpretation, is an ontological one; it is local and deterministic. Other
special assumptions in the choice of the final boundary condition may explain
certain unaccounted for phenomena, or even supply a mechanism for essential
free will. In this context we believe that a new conception of time should be
adopted.

challenging open problems. On one hand, the problems encountered at the
frontiers of modern theoretical physics like Quantum Gravity, String Theories,
etc. concern Quantum Theory, and are at the same time related to open problems
of modern mathematics. But even within non-relativistic quantum mechanics
itself there are fundamental unresolved problems that can be formulated in
elementary terms. These problems are also related to challenging open questions
of modern mathematics; linear algebra and functional analysis in particular.
Two of these problems will be discussed in this article: a) the separability
problem, i.e. the question when the state of a composite quantum system does
not contain any quantum correlations or entanglement and b) the distillability
problem, i.e. the question when the state of a composite quantum system can be
transformed to an entangled pure state using local operations (local refers
here to component subsystems of a given system).
  Although many results concerning the above mentioned problems have been
obtained (in particular in the last few years in the framework of Quantum
Information Theory), both problems remain until now essentially open. We will
present a primer on the current state of knowledge concerning these problems,
and discuss the relation of these problems to one of the most challenging
questions of linear algebra: the classification and characterization of
positive operator maps.

as equivalence classes of primordial states governed by a dissipative
deterministic theory underlying quantum theory at the ``Planck scale''.
Defining invariant subspaces clearly for primordial states according to a given
evolution, we mathematically re-formulate 't Hooft's theory as a quotient space
construction with the time-reversible evolution operator induced naturally.
With this observation and some analysis, 't Hooft's theory is generalized
beyond his case where the evolution at the ``Planck scale'' is periodic or the
time is discrete. We also give a novel illustration that the Fock space of
quantum oscillator could follow from the quotient space construction for
certain primordial states obeying non-reversible evolution governed by a
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.

more general situations. In this approach the contribution of the dominant
semiclassical paths and the relevant fluctuations about them are evaluated.

numerically and the border for emergence of quantum chaos, induced by
imperfections and residual inter-qubit couplings, is determined. This
phenomenon appears in an isolated quantum computer without any external
decoherence. The onset of quantum chaos leads to quantum computer hardware
melting, strong quantum entropy growth and destruction of computer operability.
The time scales for development of quantum chaos and ergodicity are determined.
In spite the fact that this phenomenon is rather dangerous for quantum
computing it is shown that the quantum chaos border for inter-qubit coupling is
exponentially larger than the energy level spacing between quantum computer
eigenstates and drops only linearly with the number of qubits n. As a result
the ideal multi-qubit structure of the computer remains rather robust against
imperfections. This opens a broad parameter region for a possible realization
of quantum computer. The obtained results are related to the recent studies of
quantum chaos in such many-body systems as nuclei, complex atoms and molecules,
finite Fermi systems and quantum spin glass shards which are also reviewed in
the paper.

  contact: A quantum trajectory approach</title><description>  We obtain the finite-temperature unconditional master equation of the density
matrix for two coupled quantum dots (CQD) when one dot is subjected to a
measurement of its electron occupation number using a point contact (PC). To
determine how the CQD system state depends on the actual current through the PC
device, we use the so-called quantum trajectory method to derive the
zero-temperature conditional master equation. We first treat the electron
tunneling through the PC barrier as a classical stochastic point process (a
quantum-jump model). Then we show explicitly that our results can be extended
to the quantum-diffusive limit when the average electron tunneling rate is very
large compared to the extra change of the tunneling rate due to the presence of
the electron in the dot closer to the PC. We find that in both quantum-jump and
quantum-diffusive cases, the conditional dynamics of the CQD system can be
described by the stochastic Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equations for its conditioned state
vector if and only if the information carried away from the CQD system by the
PC reservoirs can be recovered by the perfect detection of the measurements.

communicate classical information and establish entanglement between distant

quantum operations, and argue that a maximally-inseparable operation on 2
qubits is the SWAP operation. The generalisation of our argument to N qubit
operations leads to the conclusion that permutation operations are
maximally-inseparable. For even N, we find the minimum SE and CC resources
which are sufficient to perform an arbitrary collective operation. These
minimum resources are 2(N-1) ebits and 4(N-1) bits, and these limits can be
attained using a simple teleportation-based protocol. We also obtain lower

general proofs are no more difficult than the specific problems of current
interest. From a general control theory perspective, the problems we want to
study have the following character. Suppose we are given a controllable right
invariant system on a compact Lie group, what is the minimum time required to
steer the system from some initial point to a specified final point? In NMR

two legitimate users (Alice and Bob). This method has the following two
properties. First, even if an eavesdropper (Eve) steals qubits, she can extract
information from them with certain probability at most. Second, Alice and Bob
can confirm that the qubits are transmitted between them correctly by measuring
a signature. If Eve measures m qubits one by one from n enciphered qubits and
sends alternative ones (the Intercept/Resend attack), a probability that Alice
and Bob do not notice Eve's action is equal to (3/4)^m or less. Passwords for
decryption and the signature are given by classical binary strings and they are
disclosed through a public channel. Enciphering classical information by this
method is equivalent to the one-time pad method with distributing a classical
key (random binary string) by the BB84 protocol. If Eve takes away qubits,
Alice and Bob lose the original quantum information. If we apply our method to
a state in iteration, Eve's success probability decreases exponentially. We
cannot examine security against the case that Eve makes an attack with using
entanglement. This remains to be solved in the future.

the physical interactions. It introduces a new kind of representation where the
propagation of massive (invariant mass) and massless interactions are unifiedly
described by a single conformally symmetric Green's function. Sources and
fields are treated at a same footing, symmetrically, as discrete fields - the
fields in this new representation - fields defined with support on straight
lines embedded in a (3+1)-Minkowski manifold. The discrete field turns out to
be a point in phase space. It is finite everywhere. With a finite number of
degrees of freedom it does not share the well known problems faced by the
standard continuous formalism which can be retrieved from the discrete one by
an integration over a hypersurface. The passage from discrete to continuous
fields illuminates the physical meaning and origins of their properties and
problems. The price for having massive discrete field with conformal symmetry
is of hiding its mass and time-like velocity behind its non-constant
proper-time.

  in strong magnetic fields</title><description>  We discuss the Noeckel model of an open quantum dot, i.e., a straight
hard-wall channel with a potential well. If this potential depends on the
longitudinal variable only, there are embedded eigenvalues which turn into
resonances if the symmetry is violated, either by applying a magnetic field or
by deformation of the well. For a weak symmetry breaking we derive the
perturbative expansion of these resonances. We also deduce a sufficient
condition under which the discrete spectrum of such a system (without any
symmetry) survives the presence of a strong magnetic field. It is satisfied, in
particular, if the dot potential is purely attractive.

statistics, forces this time quantum to be increased by a factor of a winding
number and determines the homotopy class of the path. The value of the flux is
restricted to the rational numbers, a feature that persists in the infinite

separability and entanglement of formation (EoF) of general bipartite states.
These characterisations are of the variational kind, meaning that separability
and EoF are given in terms of a function which is to be minimized over the
manifold of unitary matrices. A major benefit of such a characterisation is
that it directly leads to a numerical procedure for calculating EoF. We present
an efficient minimisation algorithm and an apply it to the bound entangled 3X3
Horodecki states; we show that their EoF is very low and that their distance to
the set of separable states is also very low. Within the same variational
framework we rephrase the results by Wootters (W. Wootters, Phys. Rev. Lett.
80, 2245 (1998)) on EoF for 2X2 states and present progress in generalising
these results to higher dimensional systems.

relativistic Dirac equation involving the symmetry operations of time-reversal
T, charge conjugation C, parity P, and their products are reinterpreted here by

the only operator that does not mix the Bell states whereas all others do. In a
similar fashion, expressing the various logic gates introduced in the subject

discrete if the continuity of its temporal evolution is required. Besides, the

which determines its grading properties, and an n-tuple of positive integers
(m_1,m_2,...,m_n). We identify the algebras of supersymmetry, p=2
parasupersymmetry, and fractional supersymmetry of order n with those of the
Z_2-graded TS of type (1,1), Z_2-graded TS of type (2,1), and Z_n-graded TS of
type (1,1,...,1), respectively. We also comment on the mathematical
interpretation of the topological invariants associated with the Z_n-graded TS
of type (1,1,...,1). For n=2, the invariant is the Witten index which can be
identified with the analytic index of a Fredholm operator. For n&gt;2, there are n

the dimension of the kernels of various products of n operators satisfying

the violation Bell's inequality by Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type
correlations. The idea of these experiments being that: (i) Bell's inequality
is a consequence of locality, hence its experimental violation is an indication
of non locality; (ii) this violation is a typical quantum phenomenon because
any classical system making local choices (either deterministic or random) will
produce correlations satisfying this inequality. Both statements (i) and (ii)
have been criticized by quantum probability on theoretical grounds (not
discussed in the present paper) and the experiment discussed below has been
devised to support these theoretical arguments. We emphasize that the goal of
our experiment is not to reproduce classically the EPR correlations but to
prove that there exist perfectly local classical dynamical systems violating
Bell's inequality.

subset S (|S| \leq n) of a universe of size m (m \gg n), store it as a table of
bits so that queries of the form `Is x \in S?' can be answered. The goal is to
use a small table and yet answer queries using few bitprobes. This problem was
considered recently by Buhrman, Miltersen, Radhakrishnan and Venkatesh, where
lower and upper bounds were shown for this problem in the classical
deterministic and randomized models. In this paper, we formulate this problem
in the &quot;quantum bitprobe model&quot; and show tradeoff results between space and
time.In this model, the storage scheme is classical but the query scheme is
quantum.We show, roughly speaking, that similar lower bounds hold in the
quantum model as in the classical model, which imply that the classical upper
bounds are more or less tight even in the quantum case. Our lower bounds are
proved using linear algebraic techniques.

the effective potential of interaction of atoms in the crystal lattice. The
possibility of separating this inerton contribution from the value of the atom
vibration amplitude is analysed. The experiment which assumes the presence of

Angluin's model of exact learning from membership queries and Valiant's
Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model of learning from random examples. We
give positive and negative results for quantum versus classical learnability.
For each of the two learning models described above, we show that any concept
class is information-theoretically learnable from polynomially many quantum
examples if and only if it is information-theoretically learnable from
polynomially many classical examples. In contrast to this information-theoretic
equivalence betwen quantum and classical learnability, though, we observe that
a separation does exist between efficient quantum and classical learnability.
For both the model of exact learning from membership queries and the PAC model,
we show that under a widely held computational hardness assumption for
classical computation (the intractability of factoring), there is a concept
class which is polynomial-time learnable in the quantum version but not in the
classical version of the model.

times (but before equilibration) there is a regime where the entropy production
rate is fixed by the Lyapunov exponent. The nature of the transition time

up into spatial methods, as when a laser beam is focused on an individual

addressed using NMR.6,7 The density of qubits addressable spatially is limited
by the wavelength of light, and the number of qubits addressable spectrally is
limited by spin linewidths. Here, we propose a method for addressing qubits
using a method that combines spatial and spectral selectivity. The result is a
design for quantum computation that provides the potential for a density of
quantum information storage and processing many orders of magnitude greater

following points are concluded in this Letter: 1)Density matrix describes the

an individual particle in an ensemble in detail; 2) Entanglement is a property
of the wave function of a quantum particle(such as an molecule in a liquid NMR

entanglement of mixed ensemble; 3)The evolution of states in bulk-ensemble NMR
quantum computation is quantum mechanical; 4) The coefficient before the
effective pure state density matrix, $\epsilon$, is an measure of the
simultaneity of the molecules in an ensemble. It reflects the intensity of the
NMR signal and has no significance in quantifying the entanglement in the bulk
ensemble NMR system. We conclude that the liquid NMR quantum computation is
genuine, not just classical simulations.

containing a region with closed time-like curves (time-machine spacetime) is
considered with the help of the path-integral technique. It is argued that, in
certain conditions, a sort of superselection may exist for evolution of a
particle in such a spacetime. All types of evolution are classified by the
number $n$ defined as the number of times the particle returns back to its
past. It corresponds also to the topological class of trajectories of the
particle. The evolutions corresponding to different values of $n$ are
non-coherent. The amplitudes corresponding to such evolutions may not be
superposed. Instead of one evolution operator, as in the conventional
(coherent) description, evolution of the particle is described by a family
$U_n$ of partial evolution operators. This is done in analogy with the
formalism of quantum theory of measurements, but with essential new features in
the dischronal region (the region with closed time-like curves) of the
time-machine spacetime. Partial evolution operators $U_n$ are equal to
integrals over the topological classes of paths if the evolution begins and
ends in the chronal regions. If the evolution begins or/and ends in the
dischronal region, the integral over the topological class should be multiplied
by a certain projector to give the partial evolution operator $U_n$. Thus
defined partial evolution operators possess the property of generalized
unitarity and multiplicativity. The part of evolution containing repeated
returning backward in time cannot be factorized: all backward passages of the
particle have to be considered as a single act, that cannot be presented as
gradually, step by step, passing through `causal loops'.

set of equations for some wave functions or fields (or equivalently trying to
guess a Lagrangian for the same), one derives them based only on the
superposition principle and properties of wave functions under Lorentz
transformations and parity. The resulting model has striking similarities with
the standard quantum field theory and yet has no negative energy states, no
zitterbewegung effects, symmetric energy momentum tensor and angular momentum
density tensor for \emph{all} representations of Lorentz group (unifying the
theoretical description of all particles), as well as clear physical
interpretation. It also offers a possible interpretation why particles and
antiparticles have opposite quantum numbers.

dispersive dielectric using the scattering formalism for quantum fields. The
medium is modeled as a collection of harmonic oscillators with a number of
distinct resonance frequencies. This model corresponds to the Sellmeir
expansion, which is widely used to describe experimental data for real
dispersive media. The integral equation for the interpolating field in terms of
the in field is solved and the solution used to find the out field. The
relation between the in and out creation and annihilation operators is found
which allows one to calculate the S-matrix for this system. In this model, we
find that there are absorption bands, but the input-output relations are
completely unitary. No additional quantum noise terms are required.

particle is considered for particles propagating in gravitational field. The
absence of a global definition of spatial directions makes it unclear whether
the correlation may exist in this case and, if yes, what directions in distant

approximate correlation may exist and the correlated directions are connected
with each other by the parallel transport along the world lines of the

non-locality is founded in local processes.

beam by a standing wave of light. Why is this interesting? Comparing this
situation to the introductory physics textbook example of diffraction of a
laser beam by a grating, the particle beam plays the role of the incoming wave
and the standing light wave the role of the material grating, highlighting
particle - wave duality. Apart from representing such a beautiful example of
particle - wave duality, the diffracted particle beams are coherent. This
allows the construction of matter interferometers and explains why the Kapitza
- Dirac effect is one of the workhorses in the field of atom optics. Atom
optics concerns the manipulation of atomic waves in ways analogous to the
manipulation of light waves with optical elements. The excitement and activity
in this new field of physics stems for a part from the realisation that the
shorter de Broglie wavelengths of matter waves allow ultimate sensitivities for
diffractive and interferometric experiments that in principle would far exceed
their optical analogues. Not only is the Kapitza - Dirac effect an important
enabling tool for this field of physics, but diffraction peaks have never been
observed for electrons, for which is was originally proposed in 1933. Why has
this not been observed? What is the relation between the interaction of laser
light with electrons and the interaction of laser light with atoms, or in other
words what is the relation between the ponderomotive potential and the
lightshift potential? Would it be possible to build interferometers using the
Kapitza - Dirac effect for other particles? These questions will be addressed
in this paper.

first one uses the technique of adiabatic following in a dark state to produce
a large splitting angle atomic interferometer that is capable of producing one
dimensional gratings with spacings as small as 2 nm. Unlike other large angle
interferometers, this technique is not sensitive to errors in optical pulse
area and decoherence from excited state decay. This may lead to a nearly two
orders of magnitude improvement in the sensitivity of devices such as atomic
gyroscopes, which are already as good as the best laser gyroscopes. The second
interferometer uses the technique of Raman pulses to produce a two-dimensional
interferometer, with independent choice of grating spacings in each direction,
each being as small as 2 nm. This scheme may enable one to produce uniform
arrays of quantum dots with dimensions of only a few nm on each side. In
addition, it may be possible to generalize this process to produce arbitrary

invariant to uniform scaling of coordinates and a characteristic of the

degenerate eigen-spaces of a parametric family of Hamiltonians. The
computational network of unitary quantum gates is realized by driving
adiabatically the Hamiltonian parameters along loops in a control manifold. By
properly designing such loops the non-trivial curvature of the underlying
bundle geometry gives rise to unitary transformations i.e., holonomies that
implement the desired unitary transformations. Conditions necessary for
universal QC are stated in terms of the curvature associated to the non-abelian
gauge potential (connection) over the control manifold. In view of their
geometrical nature the holonomic gates are robust against several kind of
perturbations and imperfections. This fact along with the adiabatic fashion in
which gates are performed makes in principle HQC an appealing way towards
universal fault-tolerant QC.

displays the highest mobilities known in condensed matter physics. We provide a
brief summary of the experimental and theoretical results obtained for this
system. We then show that a quasi-2D set of N &gt; 10^8 electrons in vacuum
trapped in 1D hydrogenic levels above a micron-thick helium film can be used as
an easily manipulated strongly interacting set of quantum bits. Individual
electrons are laterally confined by micron sized metal pads below the helium.
Information is stored in the lowest hydrogenic levels. Using electric fields at
temperatures of 10 mK, changes in the wave function can be made in nanoseconds.
Wave function coherence times are .1 millisecond. The wave function is read out
using an inverted dc voltage which releases excited electrons from the surface,
or using SETs attached to the metal pads which control the electrons.

of spin one. The AC phase has previously been calculated from the Dirac-Pauli
equation using a gauge-like technique \cite{MK1,MK2}. In the spin-one case, we
use Kemmer theory (a Dirac-like particle theory) to calculate the phase in a
similar manner. However the vector formalism, the Proca theory, is more widely
known and used. In the presence of an electromagnetic field, the two theories
are `equivalent' and may be transformed into one another. We adapt these
transformations to show that the Kemmer theory results apply to the Proca
theory. Then we calculate the Aharonov-Casher phase for spin-one particles
directly in the Proca formalism.

subject to mixed boundary conditions $(1+\beta_{m}n^{\mu}\partial_{\mu})\phi
=0$ at $x=a_{m}$ on one ($m=1$) and two ($m=1,2$) parallel plates at a distance
$a\equiv a_{2}-a_{1}$ from each other. Making use of the generalized Abel-Plana
formula previously established by one of the authors \cite{Sahrev}, the Casimir
energy densities are obtained as functions of $\beta_{1}$ and of
$\beta_{1}$,$\beta_{2}$,$a$, respectively. In the case of two parallel plates,
a decomposition of the total Casimir energy into volumic and superficial
contributions is provided. The possibility of finding a vanishing energy for
particular parameter choices is shown, and the existence of a minimum to the
surface part is also observed. We show that there is a region in the space of
parameters defining the boundary conditions in which the Casimir forces are
repulsive for small distances and attractive for large distances. This yields
to an interesting possibility for stabilizing the distance between the plates
by using the vacuum forces.

It is shown that, even in this general case, &quot;particle&quot; solutions exist which

mass; it is postulated that these are the only solutions which represent
individual physical particles. As a consequence two basic principles of

Here, we present a no deleting principle for qudits. We obtain a bound on

with the number of copies to be deleted. In addition, we investigate

induced by mutual interactions can be eliminated using concatenated coding. The
model is solved exactly for arbitrary interaction strength, for two well-known
codes, one and two levels deep: this allows one to see under which
circumstances error amplitudes add coherently or incoherently. For deeper
concatenation, approximate results are derived which make it possible to
calculate an approximate ``threshold'' value for the product of interaction
strength and free evolution time, below which the failure probability for an
encoded qubit decreases exponentially with the depth of the encoding. The
results suggest that concatenated coding could fully handle the errors arising
from mutual interactions, at no extra cost, in terms of resources needed, from
what would be required to deal with random environmental errors.

  theory</title><description>  Philosophical reflection on quantum field theory has tended to focus on how
it revises our conception of what a particle is. However, there has been
relatively little discussion of the threat to the &quot;reality&quot; of particles posed
by the possibility of inequivalent quantizations of a classical field theory,
i.e., inequivalent representations of the algebra of observables of the field
in terms of operators on a Hilbert space. The threat is that each
representation embodies its own distinctive conception of what a particle is,
and how a &quot;particle&quot; will respond to a suitably operated detector. Our main
goal is to clarify the subtle relationship between inequivalent representations
of a field theory and their associated particle concepts. We also have a
particular interest in the Minkowski versus Rindler quantizations of a free
Boson field, because they respectively entail two radically different
descriptions of the particle content of the field in the very same region of
spacetime. We shall defend the idea that these representations provide
complementary descriptions of the same state of the field against the claim
that they embody completely incommensurable theories of the field.

available in practice, when one is restricted to imperfect measurements. We
present a detection scheme which using imperfect detectors, and possibly noisy
quantum copying machines (that entangle the copies), allows one to extract more

The case of single-photon detection with noisy, inefficient detectors and
copiers (single controlled-NOT gates in this case) is investigated in detail.
The improvement in distinguishability between a photon and vacuum is found to
occur for a wide range of parameters, and to be quite robust to random noise.

rule out all theories of physics which assume locality, time-forwards causality
and the existence of an objective real world. The Backwards-Time Interpretation
(BTI) tries to recover realism and locality by permitting backwards time
causality. BTI should permit dramatic simplification of the assumptions or
axioms of physics, but requires new work in fundamental mathematics, such as
new tools for the &quot;closure of turbulence,&quot; the derivation of statistics
generated by ODE or PDE.
  Recent events like the Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser experiment of Kim, Shih
et al have increased mainstream interest in the possibility of backwards
causality. The Backwards Time Quantum Teleportation (BTQT) experiment will take
this further. True backwards time communication channels (BTCC) are absolutely
impossible in most formulations of quantum theory but only almost impossible in
the BTI formulation. This paper discusses BTQT, the issue of backwards
causality in different versions of quantum theory and new mathematical
developments. It defines a new object, the &quot;entropy matrix,&quot; which leads to
closure of turbulence for PDE systems. Predictions of a common toy field theory
(real phi-3 QFT) are reproduced by the corresponding PDE model combined with a
new model of the micro/macro interface (2M/M).

This paper describes and analyzes possible designs for subsequent, LIGO-III

Fabry-Perot filter cavities before injection into the interferometer, and
FD-homodyne detection can be achieved by sending the output light through two

combinatorial objects like Hadamard matrices and weighing matrices to device
new quantum algorithms. We show how the properties of a weighing matrix can be
used to construct a problem for which the quantum query complexity is
ignificantly lower than the classical one. It is pointed out that this scheme
captures both Bernstein &amp; Vazirani's inner-product protocol, as well as
Grover's search algorithm.
  In the second part of the article we consider Paley's construction of
Hadamard matrices, which relies on the properties of quadratic characters over
finite fields. We design a query problem that uses the Legendre symbol chi
(which indicates if an element of a finite field F_q is a quadratic residue or
not). It is shown how for a shifted Legendre function f_s(i)=chi(i+s), the
unknown s in F_q can be obtained exactly with only two quantum calls to f_s.
This is in sharp contrast with the observation that any classical,
probabilistic procedure requires more than log(q) + log((1-e)/2) queries to
solve the same problem.

  Solving the Problem of Homogeneity of the Universe</title><description>  Evading formation of the domain walls in cosmological phase transitions is
one of key problems to be solved for explanation of the observed large-scale
homogeneity of the Universe. The previous attempts to get around this obstacle
led to imposing severe observational constraints on the parameters of the
fields involved. Aim of the present report is to show that yet another way to
overcome the above problem is accounting for Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)
effect. Namely, if the scalar (Higgs) field was presented by a single coherent
quantum state at the initial instant of time, then its reduction during a phase
transition at some later instant should be correlated even at distances
exceeding the local cosmological horizon. Consideration of a simplest
one-dimensional cosmological model with Z_2 Higgs field demonstrates that EPR
correlations can substantially reduce the probability of spontaneous creation
of the domain walls, and such effect seems to be even more promising in the
cases of two- and three-dimensional geometry.

$\Si$ and a set of measurements ${\cal E}$ ($=$ measurement system). Then we
prove for every measurement system that there exists at least one

measurement system to impose an axiomatics for context dependence. We show that
in this way we always find classical representations (hidden measurement
representations) for general non-classical entities (e.g. quantum entities).

interaction of the form x^{(\alpha)}(t)^4, where $\alpha$ indicates the
fractional derivative. Using Bogoliubov's R-operation we investigate
ultraviolet divergencies for the various parameters $\alpha$. Ultraviolet
properties of this one-dimensional model in the case $\alpha=3/4$ are similar
to those in the $\phi^4_4$ theory but there are extra counterterms. It is shown
that the model is two-loops renormalizable. For $5/8\leq \alpha &lt; 3/4$ the
model has a finite number of divergent Feynman diagrams. In the case
$\alpha=2/3$ the model is similar to the $\phi^4_3$ theory. If $0 \leq \alpha &lt;
5/8$ then the model does not have ultraviolet divergencies at all. Finally if
$\alpha &gt; 3/4$ then the model is nonrenormalizable. This model can be used for
a non-perturbative study of ultraviolet divergencies in quantum field theory
and also in theory of phase transitions.

a cavity with variable parameters. The atom in the ground state located in the
initially empty cavity can be excited by variation of cavity parameters. We
have discovered two mechanisms of atomic excitation. The first arises due to
the interaction of the atom with the non-stationary electromagnetic field
created by modulation of cavity parameters. If the characteristic time of
variation of cavity parameters is of the order of the atomic transition time,
the processes of photon creation and atomic excitation are going on
simultaneously and hence excitation of the atom cannot be reduced to trivial
absorption of the photons produced by the dynamical Casimir effect. The second
mechanism is &quot;shaking&quot; of the atom due to fast modulation of its ground state
Lamb shift which takes place as a result of fast variation of cavity arameters.
The last mechanism has no connection with the vacuum dynamical Casimir effect.
Moreover, it opens a new channel of photon creation in the non-stationary
cavity. Nevertheless, the process of photon creation is altered by the presence
of the atom in the cavity, even if one disregards the existence of the new
channel. In particular, it removes the restriction for creation of only even
number of photons and also changes the expectation value for the number of
created photons. Our consideration is based on a simple model of a two-level
atom interacting with a single mode of the cavity field. Qualitatively our
results are valid for a real atom in a physical cavity.

We show how our expressions can be used to calculate and discuss phase shifts

coupling the ^3\Sigma_u^+ (6S + 6S) continuum to the lowest bound level of the

employed. The scattering length is determined from calculated continuum

consider a simple model for quantum cosmology which includes, in the total
Hamiltonian, model detectors registering whether or not the system, at any
stage in its entire history, passes through a series of regions in
configuration space. We thus derive a variety of well-defined formulas for the
probabilities for trajectories associated with the solutions to the
Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The probability distribution is peaked about classical
trajectories in configuration space. The ``measured'' wave functions still
satisfy the Wheeler-DeWitt equation, except for small corrections due to the
disturbance of the measuring device. With modified boundary conditions, the
measurement amplitudes essentially agree with an earlier result of Hartle
derived on rather different grounds. In the special case where the system is a
collection of harmonic oscillators, the interpretation of the results is aided
by the introduction of ``timeless'' coherent states -- eigenstates of the
Hamiltonian which are concentrated about entire classical trajectories.

Information Theory in the field of Quantum Gravity. As it was suggested by J.
A. Wheeler, information theory must play a relevant role in understanding the
foundations of Quantum Mechanics (the &quot;It from bit&quot; proposal). Here we suggest
that quantum information must play a relevant role in Quantum Gravity (the &quot;It
from qubit&quot; proposal). The conjecture is that Quantum Gravity, the theory which
will reconcile Quantum Mechanics with General Relativity, can be formulated in
terms of quantum bits of information (qubits) stored in space at the Planck
scale. This conjecture is based on the following arguments: a) The holographic
principle, b) The loop quantum gravity approach and spin networks, c) Quantum
geometry and black hole entropy. Here we present the quantum version of the
holographic principle by considering each pixel of area of an event horizon as
a qubit. This is possible if the horizon is pierced by spin networks' edges of
spin 1\2, in the superposed state of spin &quot;up&quot; and spin &quot;down&quot;.

distance between the fibres of implementing vectors at normal positive linear

implementing vectors exist such that the Bures distance is attained by the
metric distance of the implementing vectors in question. We discuss to which

for the atomic reduced density matrix is written as a Markovian algorithm by
introducing a set of additional, virtual density matrices which follow, to the
level of approximation of the algorithm, all the possible trajectories of the
photons in the electromagnetic field. The technique is perturbative in the
sense that more virtual density matrices are required as the product of the
effective memory time and the effective coupling strength become larger. The
number of density matrices required is given by $3^{M}$ where $M$ is the number
of timesteps per memory time. The technique is applied to the problem of a
driven two-level atom radiating close to a photonic band gap and the

In this paper, we generalize the projection operator method by relaxing this

(Welcher-Weg) experiment in a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Although a
Welcher-Weg measurement can be performed with only a negligible amount of
momentum change in the detector itself, the change in the interference pattern
must correspond to a change in the momentum distribution of the particle.
Entanglement between the Mach-Zehnder interferometer and the Welcher-Weg
measurement introduces orthogonality that disables the interference of the
particle, but simultaneously, it also generates a momentum transfer between the
particle and other parts of the whole entangled system (including macroscopic
parts). This analysis can be related to the Delayed Choice interpretation. We
show where the momentum change takes place and we conclude that entanglement is
the key to understand how complementarity (i.e. Which Way versus interference)
and the position-momentum uncertainty relation are interwoven.

invariants of probabilistic observation without assuming physical structure.
Structure emerges from the basic assumption of science that new information
shall lead to more accurate knowledge of the invariants. This leads to
statistically unique random variables for expressing observed information:
Complex probability amplitudes. Predictions are also just random variables
computed from observed data, and must become more accurate with more
observations as input. This singles out the quantum mechanical superposition
principle. The external conditions of a probabilistic experiment can themselves
be monitored at the most detailed level, resulting in observation of coicidence
probabilities. The invariants of any multi-coincidence experiment are the same
as those of a one-event experiment with the same number of possible outcomes.
An observable probability turns out to be controllable by two independent
experimental conditions, naturally parametrized as a direction in a
3-dimensional space. In summary, the probabilistic paradigm itself defines a
unique method of forming concepts and making predictions. The method appears
irrefutable within probability, because, whenever a prediction turns out wrong
the existence of an as yet unmonitored condition is postulated, and a formal
way to incoroporate it is shown. The Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory
seems to be isomorphic to this method.

modeling (a general theory for predicting categories of behavior in varying
contexts). Since its formulation in the early 1980s, analogical modeling has
been successfully applied to a variety of problems in language. Several
striking similarities between quantum mechanics and analogical modeling have
recently been noted: (1) traditional statistics can be derived from a
non-statistical basis by assuming data occurrences are accessed through a
spin-up state (given two equally probable quantum states, spin-up and
spin-down); (2) the probability of predicting a particular outcome is
determined by the squaring of an underlying linear measure and is the result of
decoherence (which occurs when a quantum system is observed); and (3) a natural
measure of certainty (called the agreement) is based on one chance of guessing
the right outcome and corresponds to the integrated squaring of Schroedinger's
wave equation.
  Analogical modeling considers all possible combiantions of a given context of
n variables, which is classical terms leads to an exponential explosion on the
order of 2**n. This paper proposes a quantum computational solution to this
exponentiality by applying a cycle of reversible quantum operators to all 2**n
possibilities, thus reducing the time and space of analogical modeling to a
polynomial order.

quantum state while assuming that the other modes induce quantum jumps in the
usual fashion. In the weak-coupling limit, the photon number expectation of the
selected mode is also seen to execute quantum jumps, although more generally,
for stronger coupling, Rabi oscillations are observed; the equilibrium photon
number distribution is a Bose-Einstein distribution. Each mode may be viewed in
isolation in a similar fashion, and summing over their weak-coupling jump rates
returns the net jump rates for the atom assumed at the outset.

generator of discrete rotations associated to the z-component of the projection
of the angular momentum operator in such subspaces, inheriting thus some
properties of the continuum operator. The group associated to these discrete
rotations is the cyclic group of order N. Since the square of the quantum
angular momentum L^2 is associated to a partial differential boundary value
problem in the angular variables $\theta$ and $\phi$ whose solution is given in
terms of the spherical harmonics, we can project such a differential equation
to obtain an eigenvalue matrix problem of finite dimension by extending to
several variables a projection technique for solving numerically two point
boundary value problems and using the matrix representation of the angular

microtraps for cold neutral atoms. By combining several such structures on the
same ceramic substrate, we have realized the first ``atom chips'' that permit
complex manipulations of ultracold trapped atoms or de Broglie wavepackets. We
show how to design magnetic potentials from simple conductor patterns and we
describe an efficient trap loading procedure in detail. Applying the design
guide, we describe some new microtrap potentials, including a trap which
reaches the Lamb-Dicke regime for rubidium atoms in all three dimensions, and a
rotatable Ioffe-Pritchard trap, which we also demonstrate experimentally.
Finally, we demonstrate a device allowing independent linear positioning of two
atomic clouds which are very tightly confined laterally. This device is well
suited for the study of one-dimensional collisions.

theory(CFT)-quasiparticles taking into account the central charge $c[\nu]$ and
the particle-hole duality $\nu\longleftrightarrow\frac{1}{\nu}$, for
integer-value $\nu$ of the statistical parameter. The Hausdorff dimension $h$
which labelled the universal classes of particles and the conformal anomaly are
therefore related. We also establish a connection between Rogers dilogarithm

  statistics of entangled photon pairs</title><description>  By limiting the resolution of quantum measurements, the measurement induced
changes of the quantum state can be reduced, permitting subsequent measurements
of variables that do not commute with the initially measured property. It is
then possible to experimentally determine correlations between non-commuting
variables. The application of this method to the polarization statistics of
entangled photon pairs reveals that negative conditional probabilities between
non-orthogonal polarization components are responsible for the violation of
Bell's inequalities. Such negative probabilities can also be observed in finite
resolution measurements of the polarization of a single photon. The violation
of Bell's inequalities therefore originates from local properties of the
quantum statistics of single photon polarization.

for any experiment, that involves measurements of an ensemble of systems at
different moments of time. We argue, that any operational formulation of
quantum theory needs an algebra of observables and an object that incorporates
the information about relative phases and probabilities. The latter is the
(de)coherence functional, introduced by the consistent histories approach to
quantum theory. The acceptance of relative phases as a primitive ingredient of
any quantum theory, liberates us from the need to use a Hilbert space and
non-commutative observables. It is shown, that quantum phenomena are adequately
described by a theory of relative phases and non-additive probabilities on the
classical phase space. The only difference lies on the type of observables that
correspond to sharp measurements. This class of theories does not suffer from
the consequences of Bell's theorem (it is not a theory of Kolmogorov
probabilities) and Kochen- Specker's theorem (it has distributive &quot;logic&quot;). We
discuss its predictability properties, the meaning of the classical limit and
attempt to see if it can be experimentally distinguished from standard quantum
theory. Our construction is operational and statistical, in the spirit of
Kopenhagen, but makes plausible the existence of a realist, geometric theory
for individual quantum systems.

problems. Here we want to know whether quantum computers are useful for
continuous problems. We study the computation of the integral of functions from
the classical Hoelder classes with d variables. The optimal orders for the
complexity of deterministic and (general) randomized methods are known. We
obtain the respective optimal orders for quantum algorithms and also for
restricted Monte Carlo (only coin tossing instead of general random numbers).
To summarize the results one can say that (1) there is an exponential speed-up
of quantum algorithms over deterministic (classical) algorithms, if the
smoothness is small; (2) there is a (roughly) quadratic speed-up of quantum
algorithms over randomized classical methods, if the smoothness is small.

point of view. It is assumed that quantum states are relative, they depend on
and are defined with respect to some bigger physical system which contains the
former system as a subsystem. Hence, the bigger system acts as a reference
system. It is shown that quantum mechanics can be reformulated in accordance
with this new physical assumption. There is an important consequence of this
dependence: states may not be comparable, i.e., they cannot be checked by
suitable measurements simultaneously. This special circumstance is fully
reflected mathematically by the theory. Especially, it is shown that certain
joint probabilities (or the corresponding combined events) which play a vital
role in any proof of Bell's theorem do not exist. The conclusion is that the
principle of locality is fully valid in quantum mechanics, and one has to give
up instead of locality an intuitively natural-looking feature of realism,
namely, the comparability of existing states.

detailed calculations. The scheme is based on the simultaneous generation at
three frequencies: optical lasing at the two interband transitions which take
place simultaneously, in the same active region, and serve as the coherent
drive for the IR field. This mechanism for frequency down-conversion does not
rely upon any ad hoc assumptions of long-lived coherences in the semiconductor
active medium. And it should work efficiently at room temperature with
injection current pumping. For optimized waveguide and cavity parameters, the
intrinsic efficiency of the down-conversion process can reach the limiting
quantum value corresponding to one infrared photon per one optical photon. Due
to the parametric nature of IR generation, the proposed inversionless scheme is
especially promising for long-wavelength (far- infrared) operation.

usually a result of environment induced decoherence and is considered the sign
of classical behavior. We point out that the proton of a ground state hydrogen
atom can possess such a density matrix. We demonstrate on this example that an
&quot;almost diagonal&quot; reduced density matrix may derive from an interaction with a
low number of degrees of freedom (in our case with a single electron) which
play the role of the environment. We also show that decoherence effects in our
example can only be observed if the interaction with the measuring device is
significantly faster than the interaction with the environment (the electron).
In the opposite case, when the interaction with the environment is significant
during the measurement process, coherence is restored.
 Finally, we propose a neutron scattering experiment on cold He atoms to
observe decoherence which shows up as an additional contribution to the
differential scattering cross section.

inadmissible fiducial vector, a set of ``coherent states'' spans the same space
but loses its resolution of unity, and for that reason has been called a set of
weak coherent states. Despite having no resolution of unity, it is nevertheless

phenomena of quantum beats of quantum optics will allow us to consider the

physical dimensions), and entanglement (a special quantum feature making its
appearance first in such bipartite systems) as a function of the coupling
constants of the Lindblad equation. One interesting feature emerging out of
this calculation is that the entanglement may exhibit revivals in time. An
initially entangled state need not remain so for all time and may exhibit
regions of nonentanglement. Interpreting the parameters of the Lindblad theory

uncertainty. This does not seem to make the system closer to classical system
where there are no uncertainties. We examine the problem using two coupled

oscillator is assumed to be unobservable or to be in Feynman's rest of the

  in Quantum Dots</title><description>  Quantum gates that temporarily increase singlet-triplet splitting in order to
swap electronic spins in coupled quantum dots, lead inevitably to a finite
double-occupancy probability for both dots. By solving the time-dependent
Schr\&quot;odinger equation for a coupled dot model, we demonstrate that this does
not necessarily lead to quantum computation errors. Instead, the coupled dot
ground state evolves quasi-adiabatically for typical system parameters so that
the double-occupancy probability at the completion of swapping is negligibly
small. We introduce a measure of entanglement which explicitly takes into
account the possibilty of double occupancies and provides a necessary and
sufficient criterion for entangled states.

based on the notion of a quantum proof, which is a quantum state that plays a
role similar to a certificate in an NP-type proof. Specifically, we consider
quantum proofs for properties of black-box groups, which are finite groups
whose elements are encoded as strings of a given length and whose group
operations are performed by a group oracle. We prove that for an arbitrary
group oracle there exist succinct (polynomial-length) quantum proofs for the
Group Non-Membership problem that can be checked with small error in polynomial
time on a quantum computer. Classically this is impossible--it is proved that
there exists a group oracle relative to which this problem does not have
succinct proofs that can be checked classically with bounded error in
polynomial time (i.e., the problem is not in MA relative to the group oracle
constructed). By considering a certain subproblem of the Group Non-Membership
problem we obtain a simple proof that there exists an oracle relative to which
BQP is not contained in MA. Finally, we show that quantum proofs for
non-membership and classical proofs for various other group properties can be
combined to yield succinct quantum proofs for other group properties not having
succinct proofs in the classical setting, such as verifying that a number
divides the order of a group and verifying that a group is not a simple group.

(atom) located in the center of a dispersive and absorbing dielectric sphere
taken as a simple model of a cavity are calculated adopting the Onsager model
for the local field. The local-field correction factor to the external
(radiation and absorption) power loss of the molecule is found to be
$|3\epsilon(\omega)/[3\epsilon(\omega)+1]|^2$, with $\epsilon(\omega)$ being
the dielectric function of the sphere. However, local-field corrections to the
total decay rate (power loss) of the molecule are found to be much more
complex, including those to the decay rate in the infinite cavity medium, as
derived very recently by Scheel et al. [Rev. A 60, 4094 (1999)], and similiar
corrections to the cavity-induced decay rate. The results obtained can be cast
into model-independent forms. This suggests the general results for the

result of the interaction of the electromagnetic field tensor with the dual of

  The restriction to 2+1 dimensions, with this interpretation, provides a

implemented in cases where Q is a self-adjoint operator for which zero is an
eigenvalue. In that case, the physical Hilbert space is obtained by projecting
onto the kernel of Q, i.e. H_phys = ker(Q) = ker(Q*). It is, however,
nontrivial to identify and project onto H_phys when zero is not in the point
spectrum but instead is in the continuous spectrum of Q, because in this case
the kernel of Q is empty.
  Here, we observe that the topology of the underlying Hilbert space can be
harmlessly modified in the direction perpendicular to the constraint surface in
such a way that Q becomes non-self-adjoint. This procedure then allows us to
conveniently obtain H_phys as the proper Hilbert subspace H_phys = ker(Q*), on
which one can project as usual. In the simplest case, the necessary change of
topology amounts to passing from an L^2 Hilbert space to a Sobolev space.

whose energy densities are almost degenerate. The ground states include the
coherent state of interacting bosons (CSIB), the number state of interacting
bosons (NSIB), and the number-phase squeezed state of interacting bosons, which
interpolates between the CSIB and NSIB. It was shown previously that only the
CSIB is robust (i.e., does not decohere for a macroscopically long time)
against the leakage of bosons into an environment. We show that for the CSIB
the spatial correlation of any local operators A(r) and B(r') (which are
localized around r and r', respectively) vanishes as |r - r' | \sim V^{1/3} \to
\infty, i.e., the CSIB has the `cluster property.' In contrast, the other
ground states do not possess the cluster property. Therefore, we have
successfully shown that the robust state has the cluster property. This ensures
the consistency of the field theory of bosons with macroscopic theories.

(BJSW) and Dar et al. (DDH) argue that
astrophysical data can be used to establish small bounds on the risk of a
&quot;killer strangelet&quot; catastrophe scenario in the RHIC and ALICE collider
experiments. DDH and other commentators (initially including BJSW) suggested
that these empirical bounds alone do give sufficient reassurance. This seems
unsupportable when the bounds are expressed in terms of expected cost -- a good
measure, according to standard risk analysis arguments. For example, DDH's main
bound, $p_{\rm catastrophe} &lt; 2 \times 10^{-8}$, implies only that the
expectation value of the number of deaths is bounded by 120. This paper
reappraises the DDH and BJSW risk bounds by comparing risk policy in other
areas. For example, it is noted that, even if highly risk tolerant assumptions
are made and no value is placed on the lives of future generations, a
catastrophe risk no higher than $\approx 10^{-15}$ per year would be required
for consistency with established policy for radiation hazard risk minimization.
It is concluded that the costs of small risks of catastrophe have been
significantly underestimated by BJSW (initially), by DDH and by other
commentators. Lessons for future policy are proposed.

scattering involving partial waves that have not traversed the region of

We show that spin is related to intrinsic and field-like properties of single

Interactions of massive particles with homogeneous and inhomogeneous fields

analyze the difficulties in quantum mechanics to give a precise spacetime
account of the experiments and find that they arise from unsuitable analogies
for spin. In particular from the analogy of an angular momentum. Several

(spin halves) with fluctuations in individual qubit energies and residual
short-range inter-qubit couplings. In the limit when fluctuations and couplings
are small compared to the one-qubit energy spacing, the spectrum has a band
structure and we study the quantum computer core (central band) with the
highest density of states. Above a critical inter-qubit coupling strength,
quantum chaos sets in, leading to quantum ergodicity of eigenstates in an
isolated quantum computer. The onset of chaos results in the interaction
induced dynamical thermalization and the occupation numbers well described by
the Fermi-Dirac distribution. This thermalization destroys the noninteracting
qubit structure and sets serious requirements for the quantum computer
operability.

  One-Particle Properties at Zero Temperature</title><description>  One-particle properties of non-interacting Fermions in a one-dimensional
harmonic trap and at zero temperature are studied. Exact expressions and
asymptotic results for large Fermion number N are given for the particle
density distribution n_0(z,N). For large N and near the classical boundary at
the Fermi energy the density displays increasing fluctuations. A simple scaling
of these tails of the density distribution with respect to N is established.
The Fourier transform of the density distribution is calculated exactly. It
displays a small but characteristic hump near 2 k_F with k_F being a properly
defined Fermi wave number. This is due to Friedel oscillations which are
identified and discussed. These quantum effects are missing in the
semi-classical approximation. Momentum distributions are also evaluated and
discussed. As an example of a time-dependent one-particle problem we calculate
exactly the evolution of the particle density when the trap is suddenly
switched off and find a simple scaling behaviour in agreement with recent
general results.

  variables</title><description>  Recent work has extended Bell's theorem by quantifying the amount of
communication required to simulate entangled quantum systems with classical
information. The general scenario is that a bipartite measurement is given from
a set of possibilities and the goal is to find a classical scheme that
reproduces exactly the correlations that arise when an actual quantum system is
measured. Previous results have shown that, using local hidden variables, a
finite amount of communication suffices to simulate the correlations for a Bell
state. We extend this in a number of ways. First, we show that, when the
communication is merely required to be finite {\em on average}, Bell states can
be simulated {\em without} any local hidden variables. More generally, we show
that arbitrary positive operator valued measurements on systems of $n$ Bell
states can be simulated with $O(n 2^n)$ bits of communication on average
(again, without local hidden variables). On the other hand, when the
communication is required to be {\em absolutely bounded}, we show that a finite
number of bits of local hidden variables is insufficent to simulate a Bell
state. This latter result is based on an analysis of the non-deterministic
communication complexity of the NOT-EQUAL function, which is constant in the
quantum model and logarithmic in the classical model.

essential in providing the necessary isolation against thermal losses in thin

entangled. For a large class of pure entangled states, we show how large the
perturbation can be. Our class includes all pure bipartite and all maximally
entangled states. For an entangled state, E, the constucted neighborhood of
entangled states is the region outside two parallel hyperplanes, which sandwich
the set of all separable states. The states for which these neighborhoods are
largest are the maximally entangled ones. As the number of particles, or the
dimensions of the Hilbert spaces for two of the particles increases, the
distance between two of the hyperplanes which sandwich the separable states
goes to zero. It is easy to decide if a state Q is in the neighborhood of
entangled states we construct for an entangled state E. One merely has to check
if the trace of EQ is greater than a constant which depends upon E and which we
determine.

Such a procedure is called quantum erasure. We have performed such experiments

measurements bring a disturbance to the system being measured. We consider two
observers who initially assign identical mixed-state density operators to a
two-state quantum system. The question we address is to what extent one
observer can, by measurement, increase the purity of his density operator
without affecting the purity of the other observer's. If there were no
restrictions on the first observer's measurements, then he could carry this out
trivially by measuring the initial density operator's eigenbasis. If, however,
the allowed measurements are those of finite strength---i.e., those
measurements strictly within the interior of the convex set of all
measurements---then the issue becomes significantly more complex. We find that
for a large class of such measurements the first observer's purity increases
the most precisely when there is some loss of purity for the second observer.
More generally the tradeoff between the two purities, when it exists, forms a
monotonic relation. This tradeoff has potential application to quantum state
control and feedback.

\phi of the phase difference between two arms of an interferometer. For an
optimal measurement [B. C. Sanders and G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 2944

and eigenstates for a system consisting of an inverted Gaussian potential and a
monochromatic driving field. Floquet eigenvalues and Husimi distributions of
resonance eigenfunctions are calculated using two different versions of CCS.
The number of resonance states in this system increases as the strength of the
driving field is increased, indicating that this system might have increased
stability against ionization when the field strength is very high. We find that
the newly created resonance states are scarred on unstable periodic orbits of
the classical motion. The behavior of these periodic orbits as the field
strength is increased may explain why there are more resonance states at high
field strengths than at low field strengths. Close examination of an avoided
crossing between resonance states shows that this type of avoided crossing does
not delocalize the resonance states, although it may lead to interesting

aspects of their evolution which are relevant to the transition from quantum to
classical. We begin with a discussion of the conditional dynamics of simple
systems. The resulting models are straightforward but suffice to illustrate
basic physical ideas behind quantum measurements and decoherence. To discuss
decoherence and environment-induced superselection einselection in a more
general setting, we sketch perturbative as well as exact derivations of several
master equations valid for various systems. Using these equations we study
einselection employing the general strategy of the predictability sieve.
Assumptions that are usually made in the discussion of decoherence are
critically reexamined along with the ``standard lore'' to which they lead.
Restoration of quantum-classical correspondence in systems that are classically
chaotic is discussed. The dynamical second law -it is shown- can be traced to
the same phenomena that allow for the restoration of the correspondence
principle in decohering chaotic systems (where it is otherwise lost on a very
short time-scale). Quantum error correction is discussed as an example of an
anti-decoherence strategy. Implications of decoherence and einselection for the
interpretation of quantum theory are briefly pointed out.

\lambda (measured value corresponding to zero relative momentum {\bf p} of two
registered identical pions or kaons) of the two-particle correlation function
C(p,K). The approach uses q-deformed oscillators and the related picture of
ideal gas of q-bosons. In effect, the intercept \lambda is connected with
deformation parameter q. For a fixed value of q, the model predicts specific
dependence of \lambda on pair mean momentum {\bf K} so that, when |{\bf
K}|\gsim 500 - 600 MeV/c for pions or when |{\bf K}|\gsim 700 - 800 MeV/c for
kaons, the intercept \lambda tends to a constant which is less than unity and
determined by q. If q is fixed to be the same for pions and kaons, the
intercepts \lambda_\pi and \lambda_K essentially differ at small mean momenta
{\bf K}, but tend to be equal at {\bf K} large enough (|{\bf K}|\gsim 800MeV/c)
where the effect of resonance decays can be neglected. We argue that it is of
basic interest to check in the experiments on heavy ion collisions: (i) the
exact shape of dependence \lambda = \lambda({\bf K}), and (ii) whether for
|{\bf K}| \gsim 800 MeV/c the resulting \lambda_\pi and \lambda_K indeed

only a few generic properties of the full Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian H_PF enter.
Most importantly, H_PF must have an isolated ground state band for |p| &lt; p_c &lt;=
\infty with p the total momentum and p_c indicating that the ground state band
may terminate. This structure demands a local approximation theorem, in the
sense that the one- particle approximation holds until the semi-classical

  metastable Transition</title><description>  We consider pump-probe spectroscopy of a single ion with a highly metastable
(probe) clock transition which is monitored by using the quantum jump
technique. For a weak clock laser we obtain the well known Autler-Townes
splitting. For stronger powers of the clock laser we demonstrate the transition
to a new regime. The two regimes are distinguished by the transition of two
complex eigenvalues to purely imaginary ones which can be very different in
magnitude. The transition is controlled by the power of the clock laser. For
pump on resonance we present simple analytical expressions for various
linewidths and line positions.

clock transition at 237 nm was measured with an accuracy of 1.8 parts in

which was calibrated against an atomic cesium fountain clock. A frequency gap
of 37 THz at the fourth harmonic of the He-Ne standard was bridged by a
frequency comb generated by a mode-locked femtosecond laser. The frequency of
the In$^{+}$ clock transition was found to be $1 267 402 452 899.92 (0.23)$

implies that the course of time along the trajectory of motion of a particle in
the inertial reference frames moving relative to each other depends on the
state of motion of the particle under the influence of a force field. As is
seen from the results obtained, the ability to influence the course of time
represents one of the most fundamental properties of any material system
intrinsically inherent in it by the very nature of things, which manifests
itself when the system interacts with force fields. The inferences of the paper
are not based on the use of any hypotheses and strictly follow from
relativistic equations of motion. The dependence of the course of time upon the
behaviour of physical system is, thus, a direct consequence of causality
principle, relativity principle and the pseudoeuclidity of space-time. The
results obtained confirm the Kozyrev hypothesis that time has physical
properties and open up radically new opportunities for the efficient control of
physical processes. It is demonstrated with point particle that the change in
the course of time results in the appearance of an additional force acting on
the particle. A general conclusion is drawn on the basis of the theory advanced
that relativistic equations of motion for any kind of matter contain
information about the physical properties of time, which are, thus, of
dynamical nature.

quantum-mechanical state to perceived reality in the Copenhagen interpretation
(CI) of quantum mechanics - namely that the state of a particle is merely an
expression of ``what is known'' about the system - is in agreement with all
experimental facts. A conceptual flaw in Popper's proposal is identified and an
improved version of his experiment (called ``Extension step 1'') - which fully
serves its original purpose - is suggested. The main purpose of this paper is
to suggest to perform this experiment. The results of this experiment predicted
under the alternative assumptions that the CI - together with the above
connection of the state function with reality - or the ``many-worlds''
interpretation (MWI) is correct are shown to be identical. Only after a further
modification (called ``Extension step 2'') - the use of an ion isolated from
the macroscopic environment as particle detector - the predictions using the
respective interpretations become qualitatively different.

tasks that are intractable with classical computer technology. While basic
principles of a quantum computer have been demonstrated in the laboratory,
scalability of these systems to a large number of qubits, essential for
practical applications such as the Shor algorithm, represents a formidable
challenge. Most of the current experiments are designed to implement sequences
of highly controlled interactions between selected particles (qubits), thereby
following models of a quantum computer as a (sequential) network of quantum
logic gates. Here we propose a different model of a scalable quantum computer.
In our model, the entire resource for the quantum computation is provided
initially in form of a specific entangled state (a so-called cluster state) of
a large number of qubits. Information is then written onto the cluster,
processed, and read out form the cluster by one-particle measurements only. The
entangled state of the cluster thus serves as a universal substrate for any
quantum computation. Cluster states can be created efficiently in any system
with a quantum Ising-type interaction (at very low temperatures) between
two-state particles in a lattice configuration.

times between different fluxoid states of a SQUID by using ``adiabatic
inversion'' is discussed. One fluxoid state is smoothly transferred into the
other, like a spin reversing direction by following a slowly moving magnetic
field. This is accomplished by sweeping an external applied flux, and depends
on a well-defined quantum phase between the two macroscopic states. Varying the
speed of the sweep relative to the decoherence time permits one to move from
the quantum regime, where such a well-defined phase exists, to the classical
regime where it is lost and the inversion is inhibited. Thus observing whether
inversion has taken place or not as a function of sweep speed offers the
possibility of measuring the decoherence time. Estimates with some typical
SQUID parameters are presented and it appears that such a procedure should be
experimentally possible.
  The main requirement for the feasibility of the scheme appears to be that the
low temperature relaxation time among the quantum levels of the SQUID be long
compared to other time scales of the problem, including the readout time.
Applications to the ``quantum computer'', with the level system of the SQUID
playing the role of the qbit, are briefly examined.

entanglement'' [R. Horodecki et al., Phys. Rev. A {\bf 59}, 1799 (1999)]. In
this paper we discuss the general problem of distilling maximally entangled
states from $N$ copies of a bipartite quantum system about which only partial
information is known, for instance in the form of a given expectation value. We
point out that there is indeed a problem with applying the Jaynes principle of
maximum entropy to more than one copy of a system, but the nature of this
problem is classical and was discussed extensively by Jaynes. Under the
additional assumption that the state $\rho^{(N)}$ of the $N$ copies of the
quantum system is exchangeable, one can write down a simple general expression
for $\rho^{(N)}$. We show how to modify two standard entanglement purification
protocols, one-way hashing and recurrence, so that they can be applied to
exchangeable states. We thus give an explicit algorithm for distilling
entanglement from an unknown or partially known quantum state.

that quantum theory is nonlocal. However, the theoretical basis for such claims
is usually taken to be Bell's Theorem, which shows only that if certain
predictions of quantum theory are correct, and a strong hidden-variable
assumption is valid, then a certain locality condition must fail. This locality
condition expresses the idea that what an experimenter freely chooses to
measure in one spacetime region can have no effect of any kind in a second
region situated spacelike relative to the first. The experimental results
conform closely to the predictions of quantum theory in such cases, but the
most reasonable conclusion to draw is not that locality fails, but rather that
the hidden-variable assumption is false. For this assumption conflicts with the
quantum precept that unperformed experiments have no outcomes. The present
paper deduces the failure of this locality condition directly from the precepts
of quantum theory themselves, in a way that generates no inconsistency or any
conflict with the predictions of relativistic quantum field theory.

semiclassical analysis using the system symmetries shows a transition in the
dynamics of the system from self trapping to delocalization at a critical value
for the coupling between the condensates. The global dynamics are investigated
by examination of the stable points and our analysis shows the structure of the
stable points depends on the ratio of the condensate coupling to the

This semiclassical model is compared to a full quantum treatment, which also

reasons the permittivity is necessarily a complex function of frequency,
dielectrics are typical examples of noisy quantum channels in which quantum
coherence will not be preserved. Basing on quantization of the phenomenological
electrodynamics, we construct the transformation relating the output quantum
state to the input quantum state without placing frequency restrictions.
Knowledge of the full transformed quantum state enables us to compute the
entanglement contained in the output quantum state. We apply the formalism to
some typical examples in quantum communication.

as exclusion statistics; (b) Within each W_p operators B(p)_1^\pm, ...,
B(p)_n^\pm, proportional to the Jacobson generators, are introduced. It is
proved that in an appropriate topology the limit of B(p)_i^\pm for p going to

displacement of a hydrogenic bound state in an electric field (known as the
Stark effect or the LoSurdo-Stark effect), which constitutes a divergent formal
power series in the electric field strength. The perturbation series exhibits a
rich singularity structure in the Borel plane. Resummation methods are
presented which appear to lead to consistent results even in problematic cases
where isolated singularities or branch cuts are present on the positive and
negative real axis in the Borel plane. Two resummation prescriptions are
compared: (i) a variant of the Borel-Pade resummation method, with an
additional improvement due to utilization of the leading renormalon poles (for
a comprehensive discussion of renormalons see [M. Beneke, Phys. Rep. vol. 317,
p. 1 (1999)]), and (ii) a contour-improved combination of the Borel method with
an analytic continuation by conformal mapping, and Pade approximations in the
conformal variable. The singularity structure in the case of the LoSurdo-Stark
effect in the complex Borel plane is shown to be similar to (divergent)
perturbative expansions in quantum chromodynamics.

Casimir vacuum) at oblique incidence, calculating both photon speed and
polarization states as functions of angle. The analysis is performed in the
framework of nonlinear electrodynamics and we show that many features of the
situation can be extracted solely on the basis of symmetry considerations.
Although birefringence is common in nonlinear electrodynamics it is not
universal; in particular we verify that the Casimir vacuum is not birefringent
at any incidence angle. On the other hand, group velocity is typically not
equal to phase velocity, though the distinction vanishes for special directions
or if one is only working to second order in the fine structure constant. We
obtain an ``effective metric'' that is subtly different from previous results.
The disagreement is due to the way that ``polarization sums'' are implemented
in the extant literature, and we demonstrate that a fully consistent
polarization sum must be implemented via a bootstrap procedure using the
effective metric one is attempting to define. Furthermore, in the case of
birefringence, we show that the polarization sum technique is intrinsically an
approximation.

linear optics without introducing an extra phase uncertainty. This extra phase
variance is quite large for heterodyne measurements, however it is possible to
reduce it to the theoretical limit of log(n)/(4n^2) using adaptive
measurements. These measurements are quite sensitive to experimental
inaccuracies, especially time delays and inefficient detectors. Here it is
shown that the minimum introduced phase variance when there is a time delay of
tau is tau/(8n). This result is verified numerically, showing that the phase
variance introduced approaches this limit for most of the adaptive schemes
using the best final phase estimate. The main exception is the adaptive mark II
scheme with simplified feedback, which is extremely sensitive to time delays.
The extra phase variance due to time delays is considered for the mark I case
with simplified feedback, verifying the tau/2 result obtained by Wiseman and
Killip both by a more rigorous analytic technique and numerically.

maximum squeezing as the one in the undeformed case, new strong squeezing

apparent superselection rules, like that of molecular chirality. These
`environment-induced' or `soft' superselection rules may be contrasted with
`hard' superselection rules, like that of electric charge, whose existence is
usually rigorously demonstrated by means of certain symmetry principles. We
address the question of whether this distinction between `hard' and `soft' is
well founded and argue that, despite first appearance, it might not be. For
this we give a detailed and somewhat pedagogical exposition of the basic

establish a fairly precise notion of superselection rules. We then discuss two
examples: the Bargmann superselection rule for overall mass in ordinary quantum
mechanics, and the superselection rule for charge in quantum electrodynamics.

while boundary states are described by one Majorana operator per boundary

difference proportional to $\exp(-L/l_0)$ and different fermionic parities.
Such systems can be used as qubits since they are intrinsically immune to

We theoretically investigate stacking effects in the zigzag nanographite sheets

find a remarkable difference in the magnetic properties between the simple A-A

onsite repulsions. The local magnetic moments tend to exist at the edge sites
in each layer due to the large amplitude of wavefunctions at these sites. We

between the two stackings experiences the first order phase transition. The

  model</title><description>  In this paper we study a two-photon time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings model
interacting with a Kerr-like medium. We assumed that the electromagnetic field
is in different states such as coherent, squeezed vacuum and pair coherent, and
that the atom is initially in the excited state. We studied the temporal
evolution of the population of the excited level, and the second order
coherence function. The results obtained show that this system has some
similarities with the two-mode Stark system. We analize two photon entanglement
for different initial conditions.

problems, namely, charged particle moving in Coulomb and magnetic fields, for
both the Schr\&quot;odinger and the Klein-Gordon case, and the relative motion of
two charged particles in an external oscillator potential. We show that all
these cases are reducible to the same basic equation, which is quasi-exactly
solvable owing to the existence of a hidden $sl_2$ algebraic structure. A
systematic and unified algebraic solution to the basic equation using the
method of factorization is given. Analytic expressions of the energies and the
allowed frequencies for the three cases are given in terms of the roots of one

done that computational states are separable and therefore can not be
entangled. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the initial density
matrix of an individual molecule coincides with whole sample molecules
distribution over single molecule energy levels. This means that quantum
stochasticity is replaced by classical stochasticity. In the present paper it
is shown, that quantum NMR computation can create genuine entangled states if
initial system states are thermodynamical equilibrium ones. A separability
analysis problem can arise when one interprets the readout signal from whole
sample.

  from near to far above threshold</title><description>  The problem of the quantum-limited or intrinsic linewidth of a good-cavity
laser is revisited. Starting from the Scully-Lamb master equation, we present a
fully analytical treatment to determine the correlation function and the
spectrum of the cavity field at steady state. For this purpose, we develop an
analytical approximation method that implicitly incorporates the microscopic
fluctuations of both the phase and intensity of the field, and, in addition,
takes full account of the saturation of the nonlinear gain. Our main result is
a simple formula for the quantum-limited linewidth that is valid from near to
far above threshold and also includes the presence of thermal photons. Close to
the threshold, the linewidth is twice as large as predicted by the standard
phase-diffusion treatment neglecting intensity fluctuations, and even 50% above
threshold the increase is still considerable. In general, quantum fluctuations
of the intensity are present and continue to influence the linewidth as long as
the photon-number distribution is not strictly Poissonian. This inherent
relationship is displayed by a formula relating the linewidth and the Mandel
Q-parameter. More than 100% above treshold the linewidth is found to be smaller
than predicted by the standard treatment, since the simple phase-diffusion
model increasingly overestimates the rate of phase fluctuations by neglecting
gain saturation. In the limit of a very large mean photon number the expected
perfectly coherent classical field is obtained.

not perfect. They produce quantum states that contain more than only one photon

states are used for the purpose of quantum key distribution. It is shown that
the presence of &quot;multi-pair&quot; signals (together with low detection efficiencies)
causes errors in transmission even if there is no eavesdropper. Moreover, it is
shown that even the eavesdropping, that draws information only from these

traced back to the existence of branch points in the complex plane which
influence the properties of resonance states as well as of discrete states. An
avoided level crossing of two states causes not only an exchange of the two
wave functions but, above all, correlations between them. The correlations play
an important role at high level density since they cause the loss of
information on the individual properties of the states.

one-dimensional quantum mechanics. Its supercharges are N-th order polynomials
of momentum: It reduces to ordinary supersymmetry for N=1, but for other values
of N the anticommutator of the supercharges is not the ordinary Hamiltonian,
but is a polynomial of the Hamiltonian. (For this reason, the original
Hamiltonian is referred to as the &quot;Mother Hamiltonian&quot;.) This supersymmetry
shares some features with the ordinary variety, the most notable of which is
the non-renormalization theorem. An N-fold supersymmetry was earlier found for
a quartic potential whose supersymmetry is spontaneously broken. Here we report
that it also holds for a periodic potential, albeit with somewhat different
supercharges, whose supersymmetry is not broken.

intrinsically a {\it quantum gravity} phenomena. To that end we construct a
gedanken experiment in which cosmic censorship is violated within the purely
{\it classical} framework of general relativity. We prove, however, that {\it
quantum} effects restore the validity of the conjecture. This suggests that
classical general relativity is inconsistent and that cosmic censorship might
be enforced only by a quantum theory of gravity.

critically examined. A serious flaw in their design is found. New modified

acquires a geometrical phase factor in addition to the dynamical one. This
effect has been demonstrated in a variety of microscopic systems. Advances in
nanotechnologies should enable the laws of quantum dynamics to be tested at the
macroscopic level, by providing controllable artificial two-level systems (for

realized, and show how the effect may applied to the design of gates for

bipartite mixed states do not in general give the same ordering even in the
asymptotic cases [S. Virmani and M. B. Plenio, Phys. Lett. A {\bf 268}, 31
(2000)]. That is, for two certain mixed states, the order of the degree of
entanglement depends on the measures. Therefore, incomparable pairs of mixed
states which cannot be transformed to each other with unit efficiency by any
combinations of local quantum operations and classical communications exist. We
make an analogy of the relativity of the order of the degree of entanglement to
the relativity of temporal orders in the special theory of relativity.

both approaches are equivalent.

intensities can be easily understood in terms of the quasienergy-level diagram

convergent in time. The well-known continuous floppings take place because the
restricted choosing of initial conditions, that is when the atom initially is
chosen on ground or excited level before the interaction, simultaneously having
a definite value of momentum there. The convergence of Rabi-floppings in atomic
wave-packet-states is a direct consequence of Doppler effect on optical
transition rates (Rabi-frequencies): it gradually leads to ''irregular''
chaotic-type distributions of momentum in ground and excited energy levels,
smearing the amplitudes of Rabi-floppings. Conjointly with Rabi-floppings, the
coherent accumulation of momentum on each internal energy level monotonically
diminishes too.

  Information</title><description>  Consider the unstructured search of an unknown number l of items in a large
unsorted database of size N. The multi-object quantum search algorithm consists
of two parts. The first part of the algorithm is to generalize Grover's
single-object search algorithm to the multi-object case and the second part is
to solve a counting problem to determine l.
  In this paper, we study the multi-object quantum search algorithm (in
continuous time), but in a more structured way by taking into account the
availability of partial information. The modeling of available partial
information is done simply by the combination of several prescribed, possibly
overlapping, information sets with varying weights to signify the reliability
of each set. The associated statistics is estimated and the algorithm
efficiency and complexity are analyzed.
  Our analysis shows that the search algorithm described here may not be more
efficient than the unstructured (generalized) multi-object Grover search if
there is ``misplaced confidence''. However, if the information sets have a
``basic confidence'' property in the sense that each information set contains
at least one search item, then a quadratic speedup holds on a much smaller data
space, which further expedite the quantum search for the first item.

  Spins</title><description>  The conditions of quantum-classical correspondence for a system of two
interacting spins are investigated. Differences between quantum expectation
values and classical Liouville averages are examined for both regular and
chaotic dynamics well beyond the short-time regime of narrow states. We find
that quantum-classical differences initially grow exponentially with a
characteristic exponent consistently larger than the largest Lyapunov exponent.
We provide numerical evidence that the time of the break between the quantum
and classical predictions scales as log(${\cal J}/ \hbar$), where ${\cal J}$ is
a characteristic system action. However, this log break-time rule applies only
while the quantum-classical deviations are smaller than order hbar. We find
that the quantum observables remain well approximated by classical Liouville
averages over long times even for the chaotic motions of a few
degree-of-freedom system. To obtain this correspondence it is not necessary to
introduce the decoherence effects of a many degree-of-freedom environment.

computing orders of solvable groups and therefore admit polynomial-time quantum

wherein none of these problems can be computed classically in polynomial time.
As an important byproduct, our algorithm is able to produce a pure quantum

which is robust against disposals of other particles. To completely detect
these kinds of entanglement, full knowledge of the multiparticle density matrix
(or of all reduced density matrixes) is required. Then we review the relation
of the separability properties of l-partite splittings of a state $\rho$ to its
multipartite entanglement properties. We show that it suffices to determine the
diagonal matrix elements of $\rho$ in a certain basis in order to detect
multiparticle entanglement properties of $\rho$. We apply these observations to
analyze two recent experiments, where multiparticle entangled states of 3 (4)
particles were produced. Finally, we focus on bound entangled states
(non-separable, non-distillable states) and show that they can be activated by
joint actions of the parties. We also provide several examples which show the

quantum mechanics to define models that display explicitly the points at which
they can be linked to statistics of results of the use of instruments.
Extending an earlier proof that linking models to instruments takes guesswork,
we show: Any model of cryptographic instruments can be *enveloped*,
nonuniquely, by another model that expresses conditions of instruments that
must be met if the first model is to fit a set of measured outcomes. As a
result, model A of key distribution can be enveloped in various ways to reveal
alternative models that Eve can try to implement, in conflict with model A and
its promise of security. A different enveloping model can help Alice and Bob by
expressing necessities of synchronization that they manipulate to improve their
detection of eavesdropping. Finally we show that models based on pre-quantum
physics are also open to envelopment.

  Equation</title><description>  A central problem in the theory of the dynamics of open quantum systems is
the derivation of a rigorous and computationally tractable master equation for
the reduced system density matrix. Most generally, the evolution of an open
quantum system is described by a completely positive linear map. We show how to
derive a completely positive Markovian master equation (the Lindblad equation)
from such a map by a coarse graining procedure. We provide a novel and explicit
recipe for calculating the coefficients of the master equation, using
perturbation theory in the weak-coupling limit. The only parameter external to
our theory is the coarse-graining time-scale. We illustrate the method by
explicitly deriving the master equation for the spin-boson model. The results
are evaluated for the exactly solvable case of pure dephasing, and an excellent
agreement is found within the timescale where the Markovian approximation is
expected to be valid. The method can be extended in principle to include
non-Markovian effects.

path-integral method. Once we perform the Wick rotation, the euclidean equation
of motion is the same as the usual one for the point particle in real time,
except that the potential at issue is turned upside down. In doing so, our

solutions of the euclidean equation of motion. The determinants of the
quadratic differential operators are evaluated by means of the zeta-function

m_e of the mass of the proton to the mass of the electron do not depend on the
system of units being used. This paper demonstrates that one widely used method
for defining measures of entanglement violates this principle. Specifically, in
this approach dimensionless ratios E(rho) / E(sigma) of entanglement measures
may depend on what state is chosen as the basic unit of entanglement. This
observation leads us to suggest three novel approaches to the quantification of
entanglement. These approaches lead to unit-free definitions for the
entanglement of formation and the distillable entanglement, and suggest natural
measures of entanglement for multipartite systems. We also show that the

rho of bipartite quantum systems A and B of arbitrary dimensions MxN following
the lines of Ref. [M. Lewenstein and A. Sanpera, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 2261
(1998)]. Such approximations allow to represent in an optimal way any density
operator as a sum of a separable state and an entangled state of a certain
form. For two qubit systems (M=N=2) the best separable approximation has a form
of a mixture of a separable state and a projector onto a pure entangled state.
We formulate a necessary condition that the pure state in the best separable
approximation is not maximally entangled. We demonstrate that the weight of the
entangled state in the best separable approximation in arbitrary dimensions
provides a good entanglement measure. We prove in general for arbitrary M and N
that the best separable approximation corresponds to a mixture of a separable

optimal separable approximations for states with positive partial transpose
(PPT states). Such approximations allow to decompose any density operator with
positive partial transpose as a sum of a separable state and an entangled PPT

Suppose that classical storage is free while quantum storage is expensive and
suppose that the states of E do not fall into two or more orthogonal subspaces.
We show that if E can be compressed with arbitrarily high fidelity into A
qubits/signal plus any amount of auxiliary classical storage then A must still
be at least as large as the Schumacher limit S of E. Thus no part of the
quantum information content of E can be faithfully replaced by classical

  trajectory treatment</title><description>  Quantum feedback can stabilize a two-level atom against decoherence
(spontaneous emission), putting it into an arbitrary (specified) pure state.
This requires perfect homodyne detection of the atomic emission, and
instantaneous feedback. Inefficient detection was considered previously by two
of us. Here we allow for a non-zero delay time $\tau$ in the feedback circuit.
Because a two-level atom is a nonlinear optical system, an analytical solution
is not possible. However, quantum trajectories allow a simple numerical
simulation of the resulting non-Markovian process. We find the effect of the
time delay to be qualitatively similar to that of inefficient detection. The
solution of the non-Markovian quantum trajectory will not remain fixed, so that
the time-averaged state will be mixed, not pure. In the case where one tries to
stabilize the atom in the excited state, an approximate analytical solution to
the quantum trajectory is possible. The result, that the purity ($P=2{\rm
Tr}[\rho^{2}]-1$) of the average state is given by $P=1-4\gamma\tau$ (where
$\gamma$ is the spontaneous emission rate) is found to agree very well with the
numerical results.

spectral broadening incurred by repeated measurements. This control can yield
either the inhibition (Zeno effect) or the acceleration (anti-Zeno effect) of
the quasi-exponential decay of the observed state by means of frequent
measurements. In the discussed scheme, a photon is bouncing back and forth
between two perfect mirrors, each time passing a polarization rotator. The
horizontal and vertical polarizations can be viewed as analogs of an excited
and a ground state of a two level system (TLS). A polarization beam splitter
and an absorber for the vertically polarized photon are inserted between the
mirrors, and effect measurements of the polarization. The polarization angle
acquired in the electrooptic polarization rotator can fluctuate randomly, e.g.,
via noisy modulation. In the absence of an absorber the polarization
randomization corresponds to TLS decay into an infinite-temperature reservoir.
The non-Markovian nature of the decay stems from the many round-trips required
for the randomization. We consider the influence of the polarization
measurements by the absorber on this non-Markovian decay, and develop a theory
of the Zeno and anti-Zeno effects in this system.

inadequate: the usual interpretation of the mathematical formalism in terms of
the results of measurements cannot be applied to situations in which
discontinuous transitions (&quot;quantum jumps) are observed as they happen, since
nothing that can be called a measurement happens at the moment of observation.
Attempts to force such observations into the standard mould lead to absurd
results: &quot;a watched pot never boils&quot;. Experiments show both that this result is
correct when the experiment does indeed consist of a series of measurements,
and that it is not when the experiment consists of a period of observation:
quantum jumps do happen. The possibilities for improving the formalism by
incorporating transitions in the basic postulates are reviewed, and a
satisfactory postulate is obtained by modifying a suggestion of Bell's. This
requires a distinction between the external description of the whole of a
physical system and internal descriptions which are themselves physical events
in the system. It is shown that this gives correct results for simple unstable
systems and for the quantum-jump experiments.

measurement as approximately classical, and thus can be used as a pointer. The
state of the pointer, which is the result of its interaction with the spin, is
transformed into a mixed state by the coupling of the pointer to the

  oscillator traps</title><description>  We examine the time evolution of a two level ion interacting with a light
field in harmonic oscillator trap and in a trap with anharmonicities. The
anharmonicities of the trap are quantified in terms of the deformation
parameter $\tau $ characterizing the q-analog of the harmonic oscillator trap.
Initially the ion is prepared in a Schr\&quot;{o}dinger cat state. The entanglement
of the center of mass motional states and the internal degrees of freedom of
the ion results in characteristic collapse and revival pattern. We calculate
numerically the population inversion I(t), quasi-probabilities $Q(t),$ and
partial mutual quantum entropy S(P), for the system as a function of time.
Interestingly, small deformations of the trap enhance the contrast between
population inversion collapse and revival peaks as compared to the zero
deformation case. For \beta =3 and $4,(% \beta $ determines the average number
of trap quanta linked to center of mass motion) the best collapse and revival
sequence is obtained for \tau =0.0047 and \tau =0.004 respectively. For large
values of \tau decoherence sets in accompanied by loss of amplitude of
population inversion and for \tau \sim 0.1 the collapse and revival phenomenon
disappear. Each collapse or revival of population inversion is characterized by
a peak in S(P) versus t plot. During the transition from collapse to revival
and vice-versa we have minimum mutual entropy value that is S(P)=0. Successive
revival peaks show a lowering of the local maximum point indicating a
dissipative irreversible change in the ionic state. Improved definition of
collapse and revival pattern as the anharminicity of the trapping potential
increases is also reflected in the Quasi- probability versus t plots.

Fireball, or Magnetar, scenarios.
  These models are originated by an unique explosive event leading, by
internal-external shock waves, to softer secondary trains following a main
gamma signals. Indeed the earliest GRB980519,GRB981226 events as well as the
latest and most distant identified one as GRB000131 are showing rare but well
identified and distinct X Ray precursor, occurring tens of seconds or even a
minute before the main GRB eruption. These weak X precursors bursts correspond
to non-negligible energy powers, up to million Supernova ones.
  They are rare, about (3-6)% of all GRBs, but not unique.
  Similar huge explosive precursor are in total disagreement with a successive
main Fireball GRB outburst.
  Comparable brief X-ray precursor flashes are found also in rarest and most
detailed SGRs events as those observed on 27 and 29 August 1999 from SGR
1900+14.
  They are inconsistent with a Magnetar Fireball explosion.
  We interpret them as earlier marginal blazing of outlying X conical Jet tails
surrounding a narrower gamma precessing,spinning beamed Jet in blazing mode

  The X Ray precursor existence is an additional remarkable evidence of the

  perpetuum mobile of the second kind</title><description>  The Brownian motion of a quantum particle in a harmonic confining potential
and coupled to a harmonic quantum thermal bath is exactly solvable. It is shown
that at low enough temperatures the stationary state is non-Gibbsian due to an
entanglement with the bath. In physical terms, this happens when the cloud of
bath modes around the particle starts to play a non-trivial role. Indeed,
equilibrium thermodynamics of the total system, particle plus bath, does not
imply standard equilibrium thermodynamics for the particle itself at low $T$.
Various formulations of the second law are found to be invalid at low $T$.
First, the Clausius inequality can be violated, because heat can be extracted
from the zero point energy of the cloud of bath modes. Second, when the width
of the confining potential is suddenly changed, there occurs a relaxation to
equilibrium during which the entropy production is partly negative. Third, for
non-adiabatic changes of system parameters the rate of energy dissipation can
be negative, and, out of equilibrium, cyclic processes are possible which
extract work from the bath. Conditions are put forward under which perpetuum
mobile of the second kind, having one or several work extraction cycles, enter
the realm of condensed matter physics. Fourth, it follows that the equivalence
between different formulations of the second law (e.g. those by Clausius and
Thomson) can be violated at low temperatures. These effects are the consequence
of quantum entanglement in the presence of the slightly off-equilibrium nature
of the thermal bath, and become important when the characteristic quantum time
scale $\hbar/k_BT$ is larger than or comparable to other timescale of the
system. They show that there is no general consensus between standard
thermodynamics and quantum mechanics.

lattices and propositional lattices equipped with a so called operational

propositions. If the property lattice goes equipped with an
orthocomplementation, then this bijective correspondence can be refined to one

the case of histories of positions and momenta, this is achieved by doubling
the set of operators and then finding, amongst this enlarged set, new position
and momentum operators which commute, so decohere exactly, and which are
``close'' to the original operators. The enlarged, exactly decoherent, theory
has the same classical dynamics as the original one, and coincides with the
so-called deterministic quantum theories of the type recently studied by 't
Hooft. These results suggest that the comparison of standard and deterministic
quantum theories may provide an alternative method of characterizing emergent
classicality. A side-product is the surprising result that histories of momenta
in the quantum Brownian motion model (for the free particle in the
high-temperature limit) are exactly decoherent.

`known' equation having the same classical turning point structure) applied in
Fourier space. The uniform approximation used here relies upon the fact that by
passing into Fourier space the Mathieu equation can be mapped onto the simpler
problem of a double well potential. The resulting eigenfunctions (Bloch waves),
which are uniformly valid for all angles, are then used to describe the
semiclassical scattering of waves by potentials varying sinusoidally in one
direction. In such situations, for instance in the diffraction of atoms by
gratings made of light, it is common to make the Raman-Nath approximation which
ignores the motion of the atoms inside the grating. When using the
eigenfunctions no such approximation is made so that the dynamical diffraction
regime (long interaction time) can be explored.

conclusion by employing two different approaches. In a first one the local
realistic observables are deduced from the most general premises concerning
locality and realism, and Bell-like inequalities are not employed. The other
approach makes use of Bell's inequalities. Within the former scheme, under
particular conditions for the detection times, the discrepancy between quantum

not less than 20%. The same incompatibility can be made evident by means of a

the relatively low experimental accuracy, the data obtained by the CPLEAR

majorized by the vector of eigenvalues of the density matrix of system A alone.
This gives a strong sense in which a separable state is more disordered
globally than locally and a new necessary condition for separability of
bipartite states in arbitrary dimensions. We also investigate the extent to
which these conditions are sufficient to characterize separability, exhibiting
examples that show separability cannot be characterized solely in terms of the
local and global spectra of a state. We apply our conditions to give a simple
proof that non-separable states exist sufficiently close to the completely
mixed state of $n$ qudits.

  Systems</title><description>  The nonlinear supersymmetry of one-dimensional systems is investigated in the
context of the quantum anomaly problem. Any classical supersymmetric system
characterized by the nonlinear in the Hamiltonian superalgebra is
symplectomorphic to a supersymmetric canonical system with the holomorphic form
of the supercharges. Depending on the behaviour of the superpotential, the
canonical supersymmetric systems are separated into the three classes. In one
of them the parameter specifying the supersymmetry order is subject to some
sort of classical quantization, whereas the supersymmetry of another extreme
class has a rather fictive nature since its fermion degrees of freedom are
decoupled completely by a canonical transformation. The nonlinear supersymmetry
with polynomial in momentum supercharges is analysed, and the most general
one-parametric Calogero-like solution with the second order supercharges is
found. Quantization of the systems of the canonical form reveals the two
anomaly-free classes, one of which gives rise naturally to the quasi-exactly
solvable systems. The quantum anomaly problem for the Calogero-like models is
``cured'' by the specific superpotential-dependent term of order $\hbar^2$. The
nonlinear supersymmetry admits the generalization to the case of
two-dimensional systems.

essential for the future large scale realization of quantum communication
schemes such as quantum cryptography and quantum teleportation. Because of the
unavoidable noise in the quantum communication channel, the entanglement
between two particles is more and more degraded the further they propagate.
Entanglement purification is thus essential to distill highly entangled states
from less entangled ones. Existing general purification protocols are based on
the quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) or similar quantum logic operations, which
are very difficult to implement experimentally. Present realizations of CNOT
gates are much too imperfect to be useful for long-distance quantum
communication. Here we present a feasible scheme for the entanglement
purification of general mixed entangled states, which does not require any CNOT
operations, but only simple linear optical elements. Since the perfection of
such elements is very high, the local operations necessary for purification can
be performed with the required precision. Our procedure is within the reach of
current technology and should significantly simplify the implementation of
long-distance quantum communication.

to $10^{8}-10^{9}$ G at the surface and assuming that the field near the centre

the remnant which may be related to the asymmetries found from recent
spectropolarimetric observations of very young SN Ia remnants. Dependence of
the asymmetry with white dwarf composition is also analyzed.

studied. In some of the earlier work the effect of intercenter coupling on the
dissipative part was neglected. This is equivalent to a zeroth-order
perturbative expansion of the damping term with respect to the intercenter
coupling. It is shown numerically for two coupled harmonic oscillators that
this treatment can lead to artifacts and a completely wrong description, for
example, of a charge transfer processes even for very weak intercenter
coupling. Here we perform a first-order treatment and show that these artifacts
disappear. In addition, we demonstrate that the thermodynamic equilibrium
population is almost reached even for strong intercenter coupling strength.

waveguide-type nonlinear device and performed a two-photon interference
experiment with an unbalanced Michelson interferometer. Parametric
down-converted photons from the nonlinear device are detected by two detectors
located at the output ports of the interferometer. Because the interferometer
is constructed with two optical paths of different length, photons from the
shorter path arrive at the detector earlier than those from the longer path. We
find that the difference of arrival time and the time window of the coincidence
counter are important parameters which determine the boundary between the
classical and quantum regime. When the time window of the coincidence counter
is smaller than the arrival time difference, fringes of high visibility
(80$\pm$ 10%) were observed. This result is only explained by quantum theory
and is clear evidence for quantum entanglement of the interferometer's optical
paths.

studied through the von Neumann entropy of the reduced density matrices. We
demonstrate that classical chaos can lead to substantially enhanced

characterization of quantum states in higher dimensional chaotic or complex

manner in the Schmidt vectors, and the principal Schmidt vectors can be scarred
by the projections of classical periodic orbits onto subspaces. The eigenvalues
of the reduced density matrices are sensitive to the degree of wavefunction
localization, and are roughly exponentially arranged. We also point out the
analogy with decoherence, as reduced density matrices corresponding to

coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) with time-dependent asymmetric trap
potential. In the perturbative regime, the population oscillations can be
described by the Duffing equation, and the chaotic oscillations near the
separatrix solution are analyzed. The sufficient-necessary conditions for
stable oscillations depend on the physical parameters and initial conditions
sensitively. The first-order necessary condition indicates that the Melnikov
function is equal to zero, so the stable oscillations are Melnikov chaotic. For
the ordinary parameters and initial conditions, the chaotic dynamics is
simulated with numerical calculation. If the damping is absent, with the
increasing of the trap asymmetry, the regular oscillations become chaotic
gradually, the corresponding stroboscopic Poincare sections (SPS) vary from a
single island to more islands, and then the chaotic sea. For the completely
chaotic oscillations, the long-term localization disappears and the short-term
localization can be changed from one of the BECs to the other through the route
of Rabi oscillation. When there exists damping, the stationary chaos
disappears, the transient chaos is a common phenomenon before regular stable
frequency locked oscillations. And proper damping can keep localization
long-lived.

the coherent states are simply ordinary coherent states labeled by points in an

projecting the original coherent states onto the gauge-invariant subspace,
using a suitable regularization procedure. We obtain in this way a new family

which in this case is simply the cotangent bundle of the structure group K.
  The main result explained here, obtained originally in a joint work of the

associated to the generalized Segal-Bargmann transform for K, as introduced by
the author from a different point of view. This result agrees with that of K.

this channel simultaneously to M remote and separated locations with equal
minimum excess noise in each output mode. For a set of coherent-state inputs,

systems by a chirped field is presented. It is demonstrated that a field of
sufficiently high chirp rate imposes a certain relative phase between a ground
and excited state wavefunction of a two-level system. The value of the relative
phase angle is thus restricted to be negative and close to 0 or $-\pi$ for
positive and negative chirp, respectively. This explains the unidirectionality
of the population transfer from the ground to the excited state. In a molecular
system composed of a ground and excited potential energy surface the symmetry
between the action of a pulse with a large positive and negative chirp is
broken. The same framwork of the coherent mechanism can explain the symmetry
breaking and the population inversion due to a positive chirped field.

  Causally Complete Extension of Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  On 14 December 1900 Max Planck first formulated the idea of energy quanta
related to a new universal constant now known as Planck's constant. Despite the
following progress of thus initiated &quot;quantum mechanics&quot;, the physical origin
of both quantization and universality of Planck's constant remains mysterious,
as well as other &quot;peculiar&quot; properties of quantum dynamics. In this paper we
review a recent causal extension of quantum mechanics consistently explaining
all its &quot;mysteries&quot; by irreducibly complex, &quot;dynamically multivalued&quot; behaviour
of the underlying system of two interacting protofields (quant-ph/9902015,
quant-ph/9902016). The theory contains no imposed postulates or entities except
one, unavoidable assumption about the physical nature of the protofields. All
the observed entities and their properties, starting from physically real
space, time, and elementary particle structure, are consistently derived, in
exact correspondence with their emergence in real, irreducibly complex system
dynamics. The latter provides also natural (dynamic) unification of the
causally extended versions of quantum mechanics, relativity, and field theory,
including unification and causal understanding of particle interaction forces.
Realism and wholeness of the obtained world picture are in agreement with the
&quot;absolute reality&quot; quest of Max Planck and confirm his famous doubts about the
conventional scheme of quantum mechanics (cf. quant-ph/9911107,
quant-ph/0101129). We describe various applications of the obtained results
providing successful solution to many fundamental and practical problems
dangerously stagnating within conventional approaches.

determined by the closed orbits of the corresponding classical system; this
relationship is simple and strong for waves in billiards or on manifolds, but
becomes slightly muddy for a Schrodinger equation with a potential, where the
orbits depend on the energy. We discuss several variants of a way to restore
the simplicity by rescaling the coupling constant or the size of the orbit or
both. In each case the relation between the oscillation frequency and the
period of the orbit is inspected critically; in many cases it is observed that
a characteristic length of the orbit is a better indicator. When these matters
are properly understood, the periodic-orbit theory for generic quantum systems
recovers the clarity and simplicity that it always had for the wave equation in
a cavity. Finally, we comment on the alleged &quot;paradox&quot; that semiclassical
periodic-orbit theory is more effective in calculating low energy levels than

  Quantum Field Theory</title><description>  Reparametrization invariant theories have a vanishing Hamiltonian and enforce
their dynamics through a constraint. We specifically choose the Dirac procedure
of quantization before the introduction of constraints. Consequently, for field
theories, and prior to the introduction of any constraints, it is argued that
the original field operator representation should be ultralocal in order to
remain totally unbiased toward those field correlations that will be imposed by
the constraints. It is shown that relativistic free and interacting theories
can be completely recovered starting from ultralocal representations followed
by a careful enforcement of the appropriate constraints. In so doing all
unnecessary features of the original ultralocal representation disappear.
  The present discussion is germane to a recent theory of affine quantum

cipher, the quantum key can be recycled securely. We show that key recycling is
intrinsic to the quantum cipher-text, rather than using entanglement as the
key. Second, the scheme detects and corrects for arbitrary transmission errors,
and it does so using only local operations and classical communication (LOCC)
between the sender and the receiver. The application to quantum message
authentication is discussed. Quantum secret sharing schemes with similar

  Individual Attacks</title><description>  Security of the Ekert protocol is proven against individual attacks where an
eavesdropper is allowed to share any density matrix with the two communicating
parties. The density matrix spans all of the photon number states of both
receivers, as well as a probe state of arbitrary dimensionality belonging to
the eavesdropper. Using this general eavesdropping strategy, we show that the
Shannon information on the final key, after error correction and privacy
amplification, can be made exponentially small. This is done by finding a bound
on the eavesdropper's average collision probability. We find that the average
collision probability for the Ekert protocol is the same as that of the BB84
protocol for single photons, indicating that there is no analog in the Ekert
protocol to photon splitting attacks. We then compare the communication rate of
both protocols as a function of distance, and show that the Ekert protocol has
potential for much longer communication distances, up to 170km, in the presence
of realistic detector dark counts and channel loss. Finally, we propose a
slightly more complicated scheme based on entanglement swapping that can lead
to even longer distances of communication. The limiting factor in this new
scheme is the fiber loss, which imposes very slow communication rates at longer
distances.

decisive argument for or against its objective existence. In this paper we show
that introducing the issue of determinism gives the debate a new, empirical
twist. We prove that any theory that states that the basic laws of physics are
time-symmetric must be strictly deterministic. It is only determinism that
enables time reversal, whether theoretical or experimental, of
anyentropy-increasing process. A contradiction therefore arises between
Hawking's argument that physical law is time-symmetric and his controversial
claim that black-hole evaporation introduces a fundamental unpredictability
into the physical world. The latter claim forcibly entails an intrinsic
time-arrow independent of boundary conditions. A simulation of a simple system
under time reversal shows how an intrinsic time arrow re-emerges, destroying
the time reversal, when even the slightest failure of determinism occurs. This
proof is then extended to the classical behavior of black holes. We conclude
with pointing out the affinity between time's arrow and its apparent passage.

Matsubara's formalism, in which the temperature appears as a periodic Euclidean
fourth dimension of circumference 1/T, with the semiclassical periodic orbital
approximation of Gutzwiller. By inspecting the known results for the Casimir
energy at T=0 for a rectangular parallelepiped, one is led to guess at the
expression for the free energy of two ideal parallel conductors without
performing any calculation. The result is a new form for the free energy in
terms of the lengths of periodic classical paths on a two-dimensional cylinder
section. This expression for the free energy is equivalent to others that have
been obtained in the literature. Slightly extending the domain of applicability
of Gutzwiller's semiclassical periodic orbit approach, we evaluate the free
energy at T&gt;0 in terms of periodic classical paths in a four-dimensional cavity
that is the tensor product of the original cavity and a circle. The validity of
this approach is at present restricted to particular systems. We also discuss

outcome but into a greater probability for it. The probability can approach
100%, yet the measurement can undergo complete quantum erasure. In the EPR
setting, we prove that i) every partial measurement nonlocally creates the same
partial change in the distant particle; and ii) every erasure inflicts the same
erasure on the distant particle's state. This enables an EPR experiment where
the nonlocal effect does not vanish after a single measurement but keeps
&quot;traveling&quot; back and forth between particles. We study an experiment in which
two distant particles are subjected to interferometry with a partial &quot;which
path&quot; measurement. Such a measurement causes a variable amount of correlation
between the particles. A new inequality is formulated for same-angle
polarizations, extending Bell's inequality for different angles. The resulting
nonlocality proof is highly visualizable, as it rests entirely on the
interference effect. Partial measurement also gives rise to a new form of
entanglement, where the particles manifest correlations of multiple
polarization directions. Another novelty in that the measurement to be erased
is fully observable, in contrast to prevailing erasure techniques where it can

having 2K single-particle states. For pure states we introduce the Slater
decomposition and rank (in analogy to Schmidt decomposition and rank), i.e. we
decompose the state into a combination of elementary Slater determinants formed
by mutually orthogonal single-particle states. Mixed states can be
characterized by their Slater number which is the minimal Slater rank required
to generate them. For K=2 we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a
state to have a Slater number of 1. We introduce a correlation measure for
mixed states which can be evaluated analytically for K=2. For higher K, we
provide a method of constructing and optimizing Slater number witnesses, i.e.
operators that detect Slater number for some states.

  of Electron Localization</title><description>  When an ion confined in a linear ion trap interacts with a coherent laser
field, the internal degrees of freedom, related to the electron transitions,
couple to the vibrational degree of freedom of the ion. As a result of this
interaction, quantum dynamics of the vibrational degree of freedom becomes
complicated, and in some ranges of parameters even chaotic. We analyze the
vibrational ion dynamics using a formal analogy with the solid-state problem of
electron localization. In particular, we show how the resonant approximation
used in analysis of the ion dynamics, leads to a transition from a
two-dimensional (2D) to a one-dimensional problem (1D) of electron
localization. The localization length in the solid-state problem is estimated
in cases of weak and strong interaction between the cites of the 2D cell by
using the methods of resonance perturbation theory, common in analysis of 1D
time-dependent dynamical systems.

microsphere of given complex permittivity that satisfies the Kramers-Kronig
relations is studied, with special emphasis on a Drude-Lorentz permittivity.
Both the whispering gallery field resonances below the band gap (for a
dielectric sphere) and the surface-guided field resonances inside the gap (for
a dielectric or a metallic sphere) are considered. Since the decay rate mimics
the spectral density of the sphere-assisted ground-state fluctuation of the
radiation field, the strengths and widths of the field resonances essentially
determine the feasible enhancement of spontaneous decay. In particular, strong
enhancement can be observed for transition frequencies within the interval in
which the surface-guided field resonances strongly overlap. When material
absorption becomes significant, then the highly structured emission pattern
that can be observed when radiative losses dominate reduces to that of a
strongly absorbing mirror. Accordingly, nonradiative decay becomes dominant. In
particular, if the distance between the atom and the surface of the microsphere
is small enough, the decay becomes purely nonradiative.

identifying T*(K) with the complexified group K_C. The first main result is
that the Hilbert space obtained by using the Kahler polarization is naturally
identifiable with the generalized Segal-Bargmann space introduced by the author
from a different point of view, namely that of heat kernels. The second main
result is that the pairing map of geometric quantization coincides with the

in this case the pairing map is a constant multiple of a unitary map. For both

the Kahler polarization. Together with results of the author with B. Driver,
these results may be seen as an instance of &quot;quantization commuting with

between our present understanding of gravity and quantum physics. However,
Hawking's prediction of black-hole evaporation is at a semiclassical level. One
therefore suspects some modifications of the character of the radiation when
quantum properties of the {\it black hole itself} are properly taken into
account. In fact, during the last three decades evidence has been mounting
that, in a quantum theory of gravity black holes may have a discrete mass
spectrum, with concomitant {\it discrete} line emission. A direct consequence
of this intriguing prediction is that, compared with blackbody radiation,
black-hole radiance is {\it less} entropic, and may therefore carry a
significant amount of {\it information}. Using standard ideas from quantum
information theory, we calculate the rate at which information can be recovered
from the black-hole spectral lines. We conclude that the information that was
suspected to be lost may gradually leak back, encoded into the black-hole
spectral lines.

photons has the stationary limit for the drift velocities $(\vec{u}\vec{q}/
\hbar \omega_q) &lt;1 $ and grows exponentially with time for the drift velocities
$(\vec{u}\vec{q}/ \hbar \omega_q) \geq 1$. As a result of the analyses of the
phenomena of coupling of the mutual drag system of carriers with the photons,
we obtained some fundamental results: {\bf a)} the finiteness of the mass of
photon (i.e. the rest mass of the photons is not zero); {\bf b)} reality of
tachyons as a quasi-particles with a real mass in amplifying system (or
regime); {\bf c)} the mechanism of the theory of relativity and that of the
Doppler effect which coincides with the renormalization of frequency or mass as
a result of the mutual drag of carriers and photons at external field (force)
are the same. These conclusions were obtained as a result of the fact that the
relativistic factor enters the expressions of the distribution function of
photons and other physical expressions in the first order in the form
$[1-(u^2/c^2) ]^{-1}$, but not in the form $[1-(u^2/c^2) ]^{-1/2}$ as in
Einstein's theory. Also it is shown that the velocity of light is an average
velocity of photons in the ground state.

  systems: Case of the singular oscillator</title><description>  The classical and the quantal problem of a particle interacting in
one-dimension with an external time-dependent quadratic potential and a
constant inverse square potential is studied from the Lie-algebraic point of
view. The integrability of this system is established by evaluating the exact
invariant closely related to the Lewis and Riesenfeld invariant for the
time-dependent harmonic oscillator. We study extensively the special and
interesting case of a kicked quadratic potential from which we derive a new
integrable, nonlinear, area preserving, two-dimensional map which may, for
instance, be used in numerical algorithms that integrate the
Calogero-Sutherland-Moser Hamiltonian. The dynamics, both classical and
quantal, is studied via the time-evolution operator which we evaluate using a
recent method of integrating the quantum Liouville-Bloch equations \cite{rau}.
The results show the exact one-to-one correspondence between the classical and
the quantal dynamics. Our analysis also sheds light on the connection between
properties of the SU(1,1) algebra and that of simple dynamical systems.

classical data that is produced by a quantum measurement on a quantum state
ensemble. In the previous work it was shown how spurious randomness generally
contained in the outcomes can be eliminated without decreasing the amount of
knowledge, to achieve an amount of data equal to the von Neumann entropy of the
ensemble. Here we extend this result by giving a more refined description of
what constitute equivalent measurements (that is measurements which provide the
same knowledge about the quantum state) and also by considering incomplete
measurements. In particular we show that one can always associate to a POVM
with elements a_j, an equivalent POVM acting on many independent copies of the
system which produces an amount of data asymptotically equal to the entropy
defect of an ensemble canonically associated to the ensemble average state and
the initial measurement (a_j). In the case where the measurement is not
maximally refined this amount of data is strictly less than the von Neumann
entropy, as obtained in the previous work. We also show that this is the best
achievable, i.e. it is impossible to devise a measurement equivalent to the
initial measurement (a_j) that produces less data. We discuss the
interpretation of these results. In particular we show how they can be used to
provide a precise and model independent measure of the amount of knowledge that
is obtained about a quantum state by a quantum measurement. We also discuss in
detail the relation between our results and Holevo's bound, at the same time
providing a new proof of this fundamental inequality.

independent quantum states can be solved by mapping the set of nonorthogonal
quantum states onto a set of orthogonal ones, which can then be distinguished
without error. Such nonunitary transformations can be performed conditionally
on quantum systems; a unitary transformation is carried out on a larger system
of which the system of interest is a subsytem, a measurement is performed, and
if the proper result is obtained, the desired nonunitary transformation will
have been performed on the subsystem. We show how to construct generalized
interferometers (multiports), which when combined with measurements on some of
the output ports, implement nonunitary transformations of this type. The input
states are single-photon states in which the photon is divided among several

nonorthogonal states are discussed, and the networks that optimally distinguish

particle trajectory is not prescribed but is determined by the backreaction of
the quantum field in a self-consistent way. Coarse-graining the quantum field
imparts stochastic behavior in the particle trajectory. The formalism is set up
here as a precursor to a first principles derivation of the
Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation from quantum field theory as the correct
equation of motion valid in the semiclassical limit. This approach also
discerns classical radiation reaction from quantum dissipation in the motion of
a charged particle; only the latter is related to vacuum fluctuations in the
quantum field by a fluctuation-dissipation relation, which we show to exist for
nonequilibrim processes under this type of nonlinear coupling. This formalism
leads naturally to a set of Langevin equations associated with a generalized
ALD equation. These multiparticle stochastic differential equations feature
local dissipation (for massless quantum fields), nonlocal particle-particle

conditions for the two-centre Coulomb problem under the assumption that the two
Coulomb centres are fixed. With this restriction we treat the general
two-centre Coulomb problem according to the phase-integral method, in which one
uses an {\it a priori} unspecified {\it base function}. We consider base
functions containing three unspecified parameters $C, \tilde C$ and $\Lambda$.
When the absolute value of the magnetic quantum number $m$ is not too small, it
is most appropriate to choose $\Lambda=|m|\ne 0$. When, on the other hand,
$|m|$ is sufficiently small, it is most appropriate to choose $\Lambda = 0$.
Arbitrary-order phase-integral quantization conditions are obtained for these
choices of $\Lambda$. The parameters $C$ and $\tilde C$ are determined from the
requirement that the results of the first and the third order of the
phase-integral approximation coincide, which makes the first-order
approximation as good as possible.
  In order to make the paper to some extent self-contained, a short review of

a small amount of entanglement; (ii) that a known, noisy, non-local unitary
operation as well as an unknown, noisy, local unitary operation can be
purified; (iii) how to perform the tomography of arbitrary, unknown, non-local
operations; (iv) that a set of local unitary operations as well as a set of
non-local unitary operations can be stored and compressed; (v) how to implement
probabilistically two-qubit gates for photons. We also show how to compress a
set of bipartite entangled states locally, as well as how to implement certain
non-local measurements using a small amount of entanglement. Finally, we
generalize some of our results to multiparty systems.

searching of a database. It can be thought of as factorisation of the search
process. The location of a desired item in a sorted database can be found by
classical queries that inspect one letter of the label at a time. For an
unsorted database, no such classical quick search algorithm is available. If
the database permits quantum queries, however, then mere digitisation is
sufficient for efficient search. Sorting becomes redundant with the quantum
superposition of states. A quantum algorithm is written down which locates the
desired item in an unsorted database a factor of two faster than the best
classical algorithm can in a sorted database. This algorithm has close
resemblance to the assembly process in DNA replication.

$E_{1}$, $E_{2}$ and find corresponding wave functions. These entities are
expressed in terms of one function $\xi (x)$ and one parameter $\Delta
E=E_{2}$-$E_{1}$. We show how the quantum numbers of both levels depend on
properties of the function $\xi (x)$. Our approach does not need resorting to
the technique of supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics but automatically
generates both the potential and superpotential.

  II. Scalar Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac-Langevin Equation, Radiation Reaction and
  Vacuum Fluctuations</title><description>  We apply the open systems concept and the influence functional formalism
introduced in Paper I to establish a stochastic theory of relativistic moving
spinless particles in a quantum scalar field. The stochastic regime resting
between the quantum and semi-classical captures the statistical mechanical
attributes of the full theory. Applying the particle-centric world-line
quantization formulation to the quantum field theory of scalar QED we derive a
time-dependent (scalar) Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac (ALD) equation and show that it
is the correct semiclassical limit for nonlinear particle-field systems without
the need of making the dipole or non-relativistic approximations. Progressing
to the stochastic regime, we derive multiparticle ALD-Langevin equations for
nonlinearly coupled particle-field systems. With these equations we show how to
address time-dependent dissipation/noise/renormalization in the semiclassical
and stochastic limits of QED. We clarify the the relation of radiation
reaction, quantum dissipation and vacuum fluctuations and the role that initial
conditions may play in producing non-Lorentz invariant noise. We emphasize the
fundamental role of decoherence in reaching the semiclassical limit, which also
suggests the correct way to think about the issues of runaway solutions and
preacceleration from the presence of third derivative terms in the ALD
equation. We show that the semiclassical self-consistent solutions obtained in
this way are ``paradox'' and pathology free both technically and conceptually.
This self-consistent treatment serves as a new platform for investigations into
problems related to relativistic moving charges.

Generalizing Born's probability interpretation, we found that unitary
transformations in such a Hilbert space represent a new class of
transformations of probabilities which describe a kind of {\it hyperbolic
interference}. The most interesting problem which was generated by our
investigation is to find experimental evidence of hyperbolic interference. The
hyperbolic quantum formalism can also be interesting as a new theory of
probabilistic waves that can be developed parallely to the standard quantum
theory. Comparative analysis of these two wave theories could be useful for
understanding of the role of various structures of the standard quantum
formalism. In particular, one of distinguishing feature of the hyperbolic
quantum formalism is the restricted validity of the superposition principle.

trace-preserving (i.e., stochastic) maps from 2x2 matrices to 2x2 matrices.
These conditions allow one to easily check any trace-preserving map for
complete positivity. We also determine explicitly all extreme points of this
set, and give a useful parameterization after reduction to a certain canonical
form. This allows a detailed examination of an important class of non-unital
extreme points which can be characterized as having exactly two images on the
Bloch sphere.
  We also discuss a number of related issues about the images and the geometry
of the set of stochastic maps, and show that any stochastic map on 2x2 matrices
can be written as a convex combination of two &quot;generalized&quot; extreme points.
