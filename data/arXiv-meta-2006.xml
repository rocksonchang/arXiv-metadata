superposition of multiple states simultaneously. Quantum information processing
(QIP) harnesses this profound phenomenon to manipulate information in radically
new ways. A fundamental challenge in all QIP technologies is the corruption of
superposition in a quantum bit (qubit) through interaction with its
environment. Quantum bang-bang control provides a solution by repeatedly
applying `kicks' to a qubit, thus disrupting an environmental interaction.
However, the speed and precision required for the kick operations has presented
an obstacle to experimental realization. Here we demonstrate a phase gate of
unprecedented speed on a nuclear spin qubit in a fullerene molecule (N@C60),
and use it to bang-bang decouple the qubit from a strong environmental
interaction. We can thus trap the qubit in closed cycles on the Bloch sphere,
or lock it in a given state for an arbitrary period. Our procedure uses
operations on a second qubit, an electron spin, in order to generate an
arbitrary phase on the nuclear qubit. We anticipate the approach will be vital
for QIP technologies, especially at the molecular scale where other strategies,
such as electrode switching, are unfeasible.

  coupled single-electron transistor</title><description>  We consider charge-qubit monitoring (continuous-in-time weak measurement) by
a single-electron transistor (SET) operating in the sequential-tunneling
regime. We show that commonly used master equations for this regime are not of
the Lindblad form that is necessary and sufficient for guaranteeing valid
physical states. In this paper we derive a Lindblad-form master equation and a
corresponding quantum trajectory model for continuous measurement of the charge
qubit by a SET. Our approach requires that the SET-qubit coupling be strong
compared to the SET tunnelling rates. We present an analysis of the quality of
the qubit measurement in this model (sensitivity versus back-action).
Typically, the strong coupling when the SET island is occupied causes
back-action on the qubit beyond the quantum back-action necessary for its
sensitivity, and hence the conditioned qubit state is mixed. However, in one
strongly coupled, asymmetric regime, the SET can approach the limit of an ideal
detector with an almost pure conditioned state. We also quantify the quality of
the SET using more traditional concepts such as the measurement time and
decoherence time, which we have generalized so as to treat the strongly
responding regime.

of quantum origin. Following thermodynamic tradition a model quantum heat
engine operating by the Otto cycle is analyzed. The working medium of the model
is composed of an ensemble of harmonic oscillators. A link is established
between the quantum observables and thermodynamical variables based on the
concept of canonical invariance. These quantum variables are sufficient to
determine the state of the system and with it all thermodynamical variables.
Conditions for optimal work, power and entropy production show that maximum
power is a compromise between the quasistatic limit of adiabatic following on
the compression and expansion branches and a sudden limit of very short time
allocation to these branches. At high temperatures and quasistatic operating
conditions the efficiency at maximum power coincides with the endoreversible
result. The optimal compression ratio varies from the square root of the
temperature ratio in the quasistatic limit where their reversibility is
dominated by heat conductance to the temperature ratio to the power of 1/4 in
the sudden limit when the irreversibility is dominated by friction. When the
engine deviates from adiabatic conditions the performance is subject to
friction. The origin of this friction can be traced to the noncommutability of
the kinetic and potential energy of the working medium.

semispectral measure E^f, such that the moment operators of E^f are required to
be of the form \Gamma(f^k), with \Gamma a suitable mapping from the set of
classical variables to the set of (not necessarily bounded) operators in some
Hilbert space. In particular, we investigate the situation where the map \Gamma
is implemented by the operator integral with respect to some fixed positive
operator measure. The phase space \Omega is first taken to be an abstract
measurable space, then a locally compact unimodular group, and finally R^2,
where we determine explicitly the relevant operators \Gamma(f^k) for certain
variables f, in the case where the quantization map \Gamma is implemented by a
translation covariant positive operator measure. In addition, we consider the
question under what conditions a positive operator measure is projection
valued.

storage/communication medium is described by quantum mechanics. We assume an
m-ary alphabet with arbitrary prior distribution, and an n-dimensional quantum
system. Under these constraints, we seek an encoding-retrieval setup, comprised
of code-states and a quantum measurement, which maximizes the probability of
correct detection. In our development, we consider two cases. In the first, the
measurement is predefined and we seek the optimal code-states. In the second,
optimization is performed on both the code-states and the measurement.
  We show that one cannot outperform `pseudo-classical transmission', in which
we transmit n symbols with orthogonal code-states, and discard the remaining
symbols. However, such pseudo-classical transmission is not the only optimum.
We fully characterize the collection of optimal setups, and briefly discuss the
links between our findings and applications such as quantum key distribution
and quantum computing. We conclude with a number of results concerning the
design under an alternative optimality criterion, the worst-case posterior
probability, which serves as a measure of the retrieval reliability.

quantum effect, first observed by Hong, Ou and Mandel. It is a unique
interference effect that relies only on the photons' indistinguishability and
not on their relative phase. We generalize this effect by demonstrating the
bunching of two Bell states, created in two passes of a nonlinear crystal, each
composed of two photons. When the two Bell states are indistinguishable, phase
insensitive destructive interference prevents the outcome of four-fold
coincidence between the four spatial-polarization modes. For certain
combinations of the two Bell states, we demonstrate the opposite effect of
anti-bunching. We relate this result to the number of distinguishable modes in
parametric down-conversion.

that as long as the spectral gap \Delta E between the ground state and the
first excited state is any constant independent of n, the total number of

correlation functions, can be computed using polynomial space and time

resulting pulse sequences that approach full polarization transfer efficiency
for all crystallite orientations in a powder in magic-angle-spinning

orientation dependent dipolar coupling interactions and inhomogeneous

a scaffold (comb) of compensating pulses in which the pulse sequence to be
improved may be inserted. The degree of compensation can be adjusted and should

field upon a photodetection by considering a microscopic model in which the
detector is constituted of a sensor and an amplification mechanism. Using the
quantum trajectories approach we determine the Quantum Jump Superoperator (QJS)
that describes the action of the detector on the field state immediately after
the photocount. The resulting QJS consists of two parts: the bright counts
term, representing the real photoabsorptions, and the dark counts term,
representing the amplification of intrinsic excitations inside the detector.
First we compare our results for the counting rates to experimental data,
showing a good agreement. Then we point out that by modifying the field
frequency one can engineer the form of QJS, obtaining the QJS's proposed
previously in an ad hoc manner.

As a consequence, a general framework describing formally the communication and

value-passing CCS with the input and output of quantum states, and unitary
transformations and measurements on quantum systems. The operational semantics
of qCCS is given based on probabilistic labeled transition system. This

Wigner functions are derived. Such norms occur frequently in several areas of
physics and engineering. In pulse optimization for Weyl--Heisenberg signaling
in wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering channels for example it is a
key step to find the optimal waveforms for a given scattering statistics which
is a problem also well known in radar and sonar waveform optimizations. The
same situation arises in quantum information processing and optical
communication when optimizing pure quantum states for communicating in bosonic
quantum channels, i.e. find optimal channel input states maximizing the pure
state channel fidelity. Due to the non-convex nature of this problem the
optimum and the maximizers itself are in general difficult find, numerically
and analytically. Therefore upper bounds on the achievable performance are
important which will be provided by this contribution. Based on a result due to
E. Lieb, the main theorem states a new upper bound which is independent of the
waveforms and becomes tight only for Gaussian weights and waveforms. A
discussion of this particular important case, which tighten recent results on
Gaussian quantum fidelity and coherent states, will be given. Another bound is
presented for the case where scattering is determined only by some arbitrary

the set of all separable states of the same kind. The requisite Uhlmann
fidelity of a pair of two-mode squeezed thermal states is evaluated as the
maximal transition probability between two four-mode purifications. By applying
the Peres-Simon criterion of separability we find the closest separable state.
This enables us to derive an insightful expression of the amount of
entanglement. Then we apply this measure of entanglement to the study of the
Braunstein-Kimble protocol of teleportation. We use as input state in
teleportation a mixed one-mode Gaussian state. The entangled state shared by
the sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) is taken to be a two-mode squeezed
thermal state. We find that the properties of the teleported state depend on
both the input state and the entanglement of the two-mode resource state. As a

quantum reflection regime, should be automatically repelled from the surface of
a conductor without the need of an evanescent field, as in a typical atom
mirror, to counteract the van der Waals attraction. The repulsive potential
arises naturally outside the conductor and is effective at distances from the
conductor surface of about 400nm, intermediate between the van der Waals and
the Casimir-Polder regions of variation. We propose that such a field-free
reflection capability should be useful as a component in cold atom traps. It
should be practically free of undesirable field fluctuations and would be
operative at distances for which surface roughness, dissipative effects and
other finite conductivity effects should be negligibly small.

states of sufficiently complex, entangled systems will be unresolvable, or,
{\em computationally unstable}. Wavefunction collapse is postulated as an error
preventive response to such computational instability. In effect, sufficiently
complex systems turn classical because of the finiteness of the computational
resources available to the physical universe. We show that this model forms a
reasonable complement to decoherence for resolving QMP, both in respect of the
problem of definite outcomes and of the preferred basis problem. The model
suggests that QMP, as a window on the sub-physical universe, serves as a
witness to Wheeler's koan ``it from bit''. Some implications for quantum
computation and quantum gravity are examined.

this paper, we try to establish a connection between the lower bound of the von
Neumann entropy and the Berry phase defined for quantum ground states. As an
example, a family of translational invariant lattice free fermion systems with
two bands separated by a finite gap is investigated. We argue that, for one
dimensional (1D) cases, when the Berry phase (Zak's phase) of the occupied band
is equal to $\pi \times ({odd integer})$ and when the ground state respects a
discrete unitary particle-hole symmetry (chiral symmetry), the entanglement
entropy in the thermodynamic limit is at least larger than $\ln 2$ (per

entangled pair of two qubits. We also discuss this lower bound is related to
vanishing of the expectation value of a certain non-local operator which
creates a kink in 1D systems.

feasibility of time-coding protocols for quantum key distribution. Alice
produces coherent 20 ns faint pulses of light at 853 nm. They are sent to Bob
with delay 0 ns (encoding bit 0) or 10 ns (encoding bit 1). Bob directs at
random the received pulses to two different arms. In the first one, a 300 ps
resolution Si photon-counter allows Bob to precisely measure the detection
times of each photon in order to establish the key. Comparing them with the
emission times of the pulses sent by Alice allows to evaluate the quantum bit
error rate (QBER). The minimum obtained QBER is 1.62 %. The possible loss of
coherence in the set-up can be exploited by Eve to eavesdrop the line.
Therefore, the second arm of Bob set-up is a Mach-Zender interferometer with a
10 ns propagation delay between the two path. Contrast measurement of the
output beams allows to measure the autocorrelation function of the received
pulses that characterizes their average coherence. In the case of an ideal
set-up, the value expected with the pulses sent by Alice is 0.576. The
experimental value of the pulses autocorrelation function is found to be 0.541.
Knowing the resulting loss of coherence and the measured QBER, one can evaluate
the mutual information between Alice and Eve and the mutual information between
Alice and Bob, in the case of intercept-resend attacks and in the case of
attacks with intrication. With our values, Bob has an advantage on Eve of 0.43
bit per pulse. The maximum possible QBER corresponding to equal informations
for Bob and Eve is 5.8 %. With the usual attenuation of fibres at 850 nm, it
shows that secure key distribution is possible up to a distance of 2.75 km,
which is sufficient for local links.

such PEPS, which are in turn ground states of local 2D quantum Hamiltonians.
This correspondence maps thermal onto quantum fluctuations, and it allows us to
analytically construct critical quantum models exhibiting a strict area law

under a time-dependent perturbation $V(q,t)$ with typical strength
$\hbar/\tau_{V}$. The perturbation represents the action of an uncontrolled
environment interacting with the system, and is characterized by a correlation
length $\xi_0$ and a correlation time $\tau_0$. For small perturbation
strengths or rapid fluctuating perturbations, the Loschmidt echo decays
exponentially with a rate predicted by the Fermi Golden Rule, $1/\tilde{\tau}=
\tau_{c}/\tau_{V}^2$, where typically $\tau_{c} \sim \min[\tau_{0},\xi_0/v]$
with $v$ the particle velocity. Whenever the rate $1/\tilde{\tau}$ is larger
than the Lyapunov exponent of the system, a perturbation independent Lyapunov
decay regime arises. We also find that by speeding up the fluctuations (while
keeping the perturbation strength fixed) the fidelity decay becomes slower, and
hence, one can protect the system against decoherence.

In this paper we study the notion of entanglement of particles introduced by
Wiseman and Vaccaro [Phys. Rev. Lett. 91, 097902 (2003)] in several specific
physical systems, including some that occur in condensed matter physics. The
entanglement of particles is relevant when the identical particles are
itinerant and so not distinguished by their position as in spin models. We show
that entanglement of particles can behave differently to other approaches that
have been used previously, such as entanglement of modes (occupation-number
entanglement) and the entanglement in the two-spin reduced density matrix. We
argue that the entanglement of particles is what could actually be measured in
most experimental scenarios and thus its physical significance is clear. This
suggests entanglement of particles may be useful in connecting theoretical and
experimental studies of entanglement in condensed matter systems.

We characterize this source by investigating two-photon interference between
the generated signal-idler photon-pairs under various conditions. The

photon-pair correlation and to minimize contamination of the entangled
photon-pairs from extraneously scattered background photons that are produced

uncorrelated photons to be emitted in the signal/idler bands and ii) broadening

surprisingly harder than the classical counterpart. A typical example is
cloning; making a copy of digital information is straightforward but it is not
possible exactly for quantum information. The question in this paper is whether
or not quantum network coding is possible. Its classical counterpart is another
good example to show that digital information flow can be done much more
efficiently than conventional (say, liquid) flow.
  Our answer to the question is similar to the case of cloning, namely, it is
shown that quantum network coding is possible if approximation is allowed, by
using a simple network model called Butterfly. In this network, there are two
flow paths, s_1 to t_1 and s_2 to t_2, which shares a single bottleneck channel
of capacity one. In the classical case, we can send two bits simultaneously,
one for each path, in spite of the bottleneck. Our results for quantum network
coding include: (i) We can send any quantum state |psi_1&gt; from s_1 to t_1 and
|psi_2&gt; from s_2 to t_2 simultaneously with a fidelity strictly greater than
1/2. (ii) If one of |psi_1&gt; and |psi_2&gt; is classical, then the fidelity can be
improved to 2/3. (iii) Similar improvement is also possible if |psi_1&gt; and
|psi_2&gt; are restricted to only a finite number of (previously known) states.
(iv) Several impossibility results including the general upper bound of the
fidelity are also given.

two distant parties. Even though QKD has been proven unconditionally secure
against eavesdroppers with unlimited computation power, practical
implementations of QKD may contain loopholes that may lead to the generated
secret keys being compromised. In this paper, we propose a phase-remapping
attack targeting two practical bidirectional QKD systems (the &quot;plug &amp; play&quot;
system and the Sagnac system). We showed that if the users of the systems are
unaware of our attack, the final key shared between them can be compromised in
some situations. Specifically, we showed that, in the case of the
Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol with ideal single-photon sources, when
the quantum bit error rate (QBER) is between 14.6% and 20%, our attack renders
the final key insecure, whereas the same range of QBER values has been proved
secure if the two users are unaware of our attack; also, we demonstrated three
situations with realistic devices where positive key rates are obtained without
the consideration of Trojan horse attacks but in fact no key can be distilled.
We remark that our attack is feasible with only current technology. Therefore,
it is very important to be aware of our attack in order to ensure absolute
security. In finding our attack, we minimize the QBER over individual
measurements described by a general POVM, which has some similarity with the
standard quantum state discrimination problem.

Zeeman-couple to the qubits and its effects on the algorithm's performance is
studied for various levels of noise power, and for 4 different types of noise
polarization. We examine the scaling relation between the number of bits N (EC3
problem size) and the algorithm's noise-averaged median run-time &lt;T(N)&gt;. Clear

wide spectral range and some arbitrary temporal distribution. In general, some
of the $N$ photons are spread out in time while other may overlap and become
indistinguishable. From this model, we find that the temporal
(in)distinguishability of photons is related to the exchange symmetry of the
multi-photon wave function. We find that simple multi-photon detection scheme
gives rise to a more general photon bunching effect with the famous two-photon
effect as a special case. We then send this N-photon state into a recently
discovered multi-photon interference scheme. We calculate the visibility of the
multi-photon interference scheme and find that it is related to the temporal
distinguishability of the $N$ photons. Maximum visibility of one is achieved
for the indistinguishable N-photon state whereas the visibility degrades when
some of the photons are separated and become distinguishable. Thus we can
identify an experimentally measurable quantity that may quantitatively define
the degree of indistinguishability of an N-photon state. This presents a

interacting fermionic systems, which cannot be treated perturbatively. However,
physics which emerges in the low-energy corner does not depend on the
complicated details of the system and is relatively simple. It is determined by
the nodes in the fermionic spectrum, which are protected by topology in
momentum space (in some cases, in combination with the vacuum symmetry). Close
to the nodes the behavior of the system becomes universal; and the universality
classes are determined by the toplogical invariants in momentum space. When one
changes the parameters of the system, the transitions are expected to occur
between the vacua with the same symmetry but which belong to different
universality classes. Different types of quantum phase transitions governed by
topology in momentum space are discussed in this Chapter. They involve Fermi
surfaces, Fermi points, Fermi lines, and also the topological transitions
between the fully gapped states. The consideration based on the momentum space
topology of the Green's function is general and is applicable to the vacua of
relativistic quantum fields. This is illustrated by the possible quantum phase
transition governed by topology of nodes in the spectrum of elementary
particles of Standard Model.

using three conjugate bases, i.e. six states. A sequence of single photons,
each of which is prepared in one of the six states, is used directly to encode
classical information in the quantum secret sharing process. In this scheme,
each of all $m$ members in group 1 choose randomly their own secret key
individually and independently, and then directly encode their respective
secret information on the states of single photons via unitary operations, then
the last one (the $m$th member of group 1) sends $1/n$ of the resulting qubits
to each of group 2. By measuring their respective qubits, all members in group
2 share the secret information shared by all members in group 1. The secret
message shared by group 1 and group 2 in such a way that neither subset of each
group nor the union of a subset of group 1 and a subset of group 2 can extract
the secret message, but each whole group (all the members of each group) can.
The scheme is asymptotically 100% in efficiency. It makes the Trojan horse
attack with a multi-photon signal, the fake-signal attack with EPR pairs, the
attack with single photons, and the attack with invisible photons to be
nullification. We show that it is secure and has an advantage over the one
based on two conjugate bases. We also give the upper bounds of the average
success probabilities for dishonest agent eavesdropping encryption using the
fake-signal attack with any two-particle entangled states. This protocol is

Finding a combinatorial model for some mathematical entity is a particular
instance of the process called ``categorification''. Examples include the
interpretation of N as the Burnside rig of the category of finite sets with
product and coproduct, and the interpretation of N[x] as the category of
combinatorial species. This has interesting applications to quantum mechanics,
and in particular the quantum harmonic oscillator, via Joyal's ``species'', a
new generalization called ``stuff types'', and operators between these, which
can be represented as rudimentary Feynman diagrams for the oscillator. In
quantum mechanics, we want to represent states in an algebra over the complex
numbers, and also want our Feynman diagrams to carry more structure than these
``stuff operators'' can do, and these turn out to be closely related. We will
show how to construct a combinatorial model for the quantum harmonic oscillator
in which the group of phases, U(1), plays a special role. We describe a general
notion of ``M-Stuff Types'' for any monoid M, and see that the case M=U(1)
provides an interpretation of time evolution in the combinatorial setting, as
well as other quantum mechanical features of the harmonic oscillator.

  and computing</title><description>  It is expected that quantum wires (q-wires), will be required to transport
quantum information within many quantum computer implementations. Here we
describe a new design for a q-wire with perfect transmission using a uniformly
coupled Ising spin chain subject to global (homogeneously-applied) pulses.
Besides allowing for perfect transport of single qubits, the design also yields
the perfect ``mirroring'' of multiply encoded qubits within the wire. We
further utilise this global-pulse generated perfect mirror operation as a
``clock cycle'' to perform universal quantum computation on these multiply
encoded qubits. We demonstrate the operation of single and two-qubit quantum
logic gates and show that only $N-1$ complete mirror cycles are required to
execute a quantum Fourier transform on $N$ qubits encoded within the q-wire.

satisfy causality only rarely; such ensembles can in general be used to signal

endohedral fullerene shuttle operating in the Coulomb blockade regime, i.e.
single electron shuttling. In particular we examine the dependance of the
tunnel current on an ultra-small stationary force exerted on the shuttle. We
derive a quantum master equation for the full shuttle system which includes the
metallic contacts, the spatially dependent tunnel couplings to the shuttle, the
electronic and motional degrees of freedom of the shuttle itself and a coupling
of the shuttle's motion to a phonon bath. We analyse the resulting quantum
master equation and find that, due to the exponential dependance of the tunnel
probability on the shuttle-contact separation, the current is highly sensitive
to very small forces. In particular we predict that the spin state of the
endohedral electrons of the endohedral fullerene in a large magnetic gradient
field can be distinguished from the resulting current signals within a few tens
of nanoseconds. This effect could prove useful for the detection of the
endohedral spin-state of individual paramagnetic molecules such as N@C60 and

previous state-reconstruction techniques, which account only for decoherence.
We extend these techniques and find that a single modified density matrix can

which the system and the observer are assumed to be in a pure state and their
interaction deterministically changes the states such that the outcome can be
read from the state of the observer after the interaction. If the observer
consistently realizes the outcome which maximizes the likelihood ratio that the
outcome pertains to the system under study (and not to his own state), he will
be called Bayes-optimal. We calculate the probability if for each trial of the
experiment the observer is in a new state picked randomly from his set of
states, and the system under investigation is taken from an ensemble of
identical pure states. For classical statistical mixtures, the relative
frequency resulting from the maximum likelihood principle is an unbiased
estimator of the components of the mixture. For repeated Bayes-optimal
observation in case the state space is complex Hilbert space, the relative
frequency converges to the Born rule. Hence, the principle of Bayes-optimal
observation can be regarded as an underlying mechanism for the Born rule. We
show the outcome assignment of the Bayes-optimal observer is invariant under
unitary transformations and contextual, but the probability that results from
repeated application is non-contextual. The proposal gives a concise
interpretation for the meaning of the occurrence of a single outcome in a
quantum experiment as the unique outcome that, relative to the state of the
system, is least dependent on the state of the observe at the instant of

framework of quantum adiabatic computation (QAC). We first derive a remarkable
lower bound for the computation time for adiabatic algorithms in general as a
function of the energy involved in the computation. Energy, and not just time
and space, must thus be considered in the evaluation of algorithm complexity,
in perfect accordance with the understanding that all computation is physical.
We then propose, with oracular Hamiltonians, new quantum adiabatic algorithms
of which not only the lower bound in time but also the energy requirement do
not increase exponentially in the size of the input. Such an improvement in
both time and energy complexity, as compared to all other existing algorithms
for TSP, is apparently due to quantum entanglement. We also appeal to the
general theory of Diophantine equations in a speculation on physical
implementation of those oracular Hamiltonians.

  systems</title><description>  We address the information/disturbance trade-off for state-measurements on
continuous variable Gaussian systems and suggest minimal schemes for
implementations. In our schemes, the symbols from a given alphabet are encoded
in a set of Gaussian signals which are coupled to a probe excited in a known
state. After the interaction the probe is measured, in order to infer the
transmitted state, while the conditional state of the signal is left for the
subsequent user. The schemes are minimal, {\em i.e.} involve a single
additional probe, and allow for the nondemolitive transmission of a continuous
real alphabet over a quantum channel. The trade-off between information gain
and state disturbance is quantified by fidelities and, after optimization with
respect to the measurement, analyzed in terms of the energy carried by the
signal and the probe. We found that transmission fidelity only depends on the
energy of the signal and the probe, whereas estimation fidelity also depends on
the alphabet size and the measurement gain. Increasing the probe energy does
not necessarily lead to a better trade-off, the most relevant parameter being
the ratio between the alphabet size and the signal width, which in turn
determine the allocation of the signal energy.

measure theory by Kolmogorov in 1933. Quantum theory as nonclassical
probability theory was incorporated into the beginnings of noncommutative
measure theory by von Neumann in the early thirties, as well. To precisely this
end, von Neumann initiated the study of what are now called von Neumann
algebras and, with Murray, made a first classification of such algebras into
three types. The nonrelativistic quantum theory of systems with finitely many
degrees of freedom deals exclusively with type I algebras. However, for the
description of further quantum systems, the other types of von Neumann algebras
are indispensable. The paper reviews quantum probability theory in terms of
general von Neumann algebras, stressing the similarity of the conceptual
structure of classical and noncommutative probability theories and emphasizing
the correspondence between the classical and quantum concepts, though also
indicating the nonclassical nature of quantum probabilistic predictions. In
addition, differences between the probability theories in the type I, II and
III settings are explained. A brief description is given of quantum systems for
which probability theory based on type I algebras is known to be insufficient.
These illustrate the physical significance of the previously mentioned
differences.

receiver making a measurement on the system so as to distinguish as well as
possible the alphabet of states used by the sender. We consider the situation
in which this measurement takes an appreciable time. In this case the
measurement must be described by a continuous measurement process. We consider
a continuous implementation of the optimal measurement for distinguishing
between two non-orthogonal states, and show that feedback control can be used
during this measurement to increase the rate at which the information regarding
the initial preparation is obtained. We show that while the maximum obtainable
increase is modest, the effect is purely quantum mechanical in the sense that
the enhancement is only possible when the initial states are non-orthogonal. We
find further that the enhancement in the rate of information gain is achieved
at the expense of reducing the total information which the measurement can
extract in the long-time limit.

In particular, we concentrate on relaxation of time evolving quantum state in

  over 60km Telecom Fiber</title><description>  Decoy state quantum key distribution (QKD) has been proposed as a novel
approach to improve dramatically both the security and the performance of
practical QKD set-ups. Recently, many theoretical efforts have been made on
this topic and have theoretically predicted the high performance of decoy
method. However, the gap between theory and experiment remains open. In this
paper, we report the first experiments on decoy state QKD, thus bridging the
gap. Two protocols of decoy state QKD are implemented: one-decoy protocol over
15km of standard telecom fiber, and weak+vacuum protocol over 60km of standard
telecom fiber. We implemented the decoy state method on a modified commercial
QKD system. The modification we made is simply adding commercial acousto-optic
modulator (AOM) on the QKD system. The AOM is used to modulate the intensity of
each signal individually, thus implementing the decoy state method. As an
important part of implementation, numerical simulation of our set-up is also
performed. The simulation shows that standard security proofs give a zero key
generation rate at the distance we perform decoy state QKD (both 15km and
60km). Therefore decoy state QKD is necessary for long distance secure
communication. Our implementation shows explicitly the power and feasibility of
decoy method, and brings it to our real-life.

a quantum dot detector (QDD), where the mesoscopic system and the QDD are
capacitively coupled. The QDD is considered to have coherent resonant
tunnelling via a single level. It is found that the dephasing rate is
proportional to the square of the conductance of the QDD for the Breit-Wigner
model, showing that the dephasing is completely different from the shot noise
of the detector. The measurement rate, on the other hand, shows a dip near the
resonance. Our findings are peculiar especially for a symmetric detector in the
following aspect: The dephasing rate is maximum at resonance of the QDD where
the detector conductance is insensitive to the charge state of the mesoscopic
system. As a result, the efficiency of the detector shows a dip and vanishes at
resonance, in contrast to the single-channel symmetric non-resonant detector
that has always a maximum efficiency. We find that this difference originates
from a very general property of the scattering matrix: The abrupt phase change
exists in the scattering amplitudes in the presence of the symmetry, which is
insensitive to the detector current but {\em stores} the information of the
quantum state of the mesoscopic system.

particular the PM-operators fulfil the main postulate, which is due to Wigner:
they satisfy the equations of motion (the Hamiltonian's equations) and the
Heisenberg equations. One of the relevant features is that the coordinate (the
momentum) operators do not commute, but instead their squares do commute. As a
result the space structure of the basis states corresponds to pictures when
each oscillating particle is measured to occupy with equal probability only
finite number of points, typically the eight vertices of a parallelepiped. The
state spaces are finite-dimensional, the spectrum of the energy is finite with
equally spaced energy levels. An essentially new feature is that the angular
momenta of all particles are aligned. Therefore there exists a strong
interaction or correlation between the particles, which is not of dynamical,
but of statistical origin. Another relevant feature is that the standard
deviations of, say, the $k$-th coordinate and the momenta of $\alpha$-th is $
\Delta \hat R_{\alpha k} \Delta \hat P_{\alpha k} \le {p \hbar/{|N-3|}}~(~N\ne
3,~ p -$fixed positive integer), namely instead of uncertainty relations one
has &quot;certainty&quot; relations. The underlying Lie superalgebraic structure of the
oscillator is also relevant and will be explained in the context.

  reformulation of quantum mechanics</title><description>  In a comparison of the principles of special relativity and of quantum
mechanics, the former theory is marked by its relative economy and apparent
explanatory simplicity. A number of theorists have thus been led to search for
a small number of postulates - essentially information theoretic in nature -
that would play the role in quantum mechanics that the relativity principle and
the light postulate jointly play in Einstein's 1905 special relativity theory.
The purpose of the present paper is to resist this idea, at least in so far as
it is supposed to reveal the fundamental form of the theory. It is argued that
the methodology of Einstein's 1905 theory represents a victory of pragmatism
over explanatory depth; and that its adoption only made sense in the context of
the chaotic state state of physics at the start of the 20th century - as
Einstein well knew.

to a well-posed bound state problem when x is taken on a contour in the
lower-half complex plane. It is then PT-symmetric rather than Hermitian.
Nonetheless it has been shown numerically to have a real spectrum, and a proof
of reality, involving the correspondence between ordinary differential
equations and integral systems, was subsequently constructed for the general
class of potentials -(ix)^N. For PT-symmetric but non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
the natural PT metric is not positive definite, but a dynamically-defined
positive-definite metric can be defined, depending on an operator Q. Further,
with the help of this operator an equivalent Hermitian Hamiltonian h can be
constructed. This programme has been carried out exactly for a few soluble
models, and the first few terms of a perturbative expansion have been found for
the potential m^2x^2+igx^3. However, until now, the -x^4 potential has proved
intractable. In the present paper we give explicit, closed-form expressions for
Q and h, which are made possible by a particular parametrization of the contour
in the complex plane on which the problem is defined. This constitutes an
explicit proof of the reality of the spectrum. The resulting equivalent

drop is replaced by superfluid helium. When levitated in a magnetic trap, and
subjected to microwave-frequency electromagnetic radiation, a pair of such

efficient quantum transducer between quadrupolar electromagnetic and
gravitational radiation. This leads to the possibility of a Hertz-like

for these quantum transducers over that for electrons arises from the fact that

theory developed in this paper is relevant to a variety of specific
applications. Such as, alignment or orientation of molecules by lasers,
trapping of ultracold molecules in optical traps, molecular optics and
interferometry, rovibrational spectroscopy of molecules in the presence of
intense laser light, or generation of high order harmonics from molecules.
Starting from the first quantum mechanical principles, we derive an appropriate
molecular Hamiltonian suitable for description of the center of mass,
rotational, vibrational and electronic molecular motions driven by the field
within the electric dipole approximation. Consequently, the concept of the
Born-Oppenheimer separation between the electronic and the nuclear degrees of
freedom in the presence of an electromagnetic field is introduced. Special
cases of the dc/ac field limits are then discussed separately. Finally, we
consider a perturbative regime of a weak dc/ac field, and obtain simple
analytic formulas for the associated Born-Oppenheimer
translational/rotational/vibrational molecular Hamiltonian.

deterministic queries and the only source of randomness for quantum algorithms
is through measurement. This setting is related to the worst case setting on a
classical computer in the sense that the number of qubits needed to solve a
continuous problem must be at least equal to the logarithm of the worst case
information complexity of this problem. Since the number of qubits must be
finite, we cannot solve continuous problems on a quantum computer with infinite
worst case information complexity. This can even happen for continuous problems
with small randomized complexity on a classical computer. A simple example is
integration of bounded continuous functions. To overcome this bad property that
limits the power of quantum computation for continuous problems, we study the
quantum setting in which randomized queries are allowed. This type of query is
used in Shor's algorithm. The quantum setting with randomized queries is
related to the randomized classical setting in the sense that the number of
qubits needed to solve a continuous problem must be at least equal to the

followed by full, half and quarter quantum revivals of the rotational wave
packets. In Four Wave Mixing (FWM) experiments, we make use of the long
succession of repetitive alignment revivals to demonstrate isotope-selective
alignment and time-resolved discrimination between different isotopic species.
For two isotopes with a commensurate ratio of their moments of inertia, we
observe constructive and destructive interferences of the FWM signals
originating from different isotopes. Such destructive interference serves as an
indication for distinct transient angular distributions of different isotopic
species, paving the way to novel time-resolved analytic techniques, as well as
to robust methods for isotope separation. When two pulses are used, enhancement
or reduction of the degree of rotational excitation and of the corresponding
molecular alignment is observed, depending on the delay between pulses. We
implement the double pulse excitation scheme in a binary isotopic mixture,
enhancing the rotational excitation of one isotopic component while almost
totally reducing the rotational excitation of the other.

storage device. The information is encrypted in the collective ground state
atomic coherence, which, in the absence of external excitation, is decoupled
from the vacuum and therefore decoherence free. However, in the process of
manipulation of atoms with light pulses (writing, reading), one inadvertently
introduces a coupling to the environment, i.e. a source of decoherence. The
dissipation process is often treated as an independent process for each atom in
the ensemble, an approach which fails at large atomic optical depths where
cooperative effects must be taken into account. In this paper, the cooperative
behavior of spin decoherence and population transfer for a system of two,
driven multilevel-atoms is studied. Not surprisingly, an enhancement in the
decoherence rate is found, when the atoms are separated by a distance that is
small compared to an optical wavelength; however, it is found that this rate
increases even further for somewhat larger separations for atoms aligned along
the direction of the driving field's propagation vector. A treatment of the
cooperative modification of optical pumping rates and an effect of polarization
swapping between atoms is also discussed, lending additional insight into the
origin of the collective decay.

needed in order to build up cluster states for quantum computing using the
toolbox of linear optics. As the needed gates in dual-rail encoding are
necessarily probabilistic with known optimal success probability, this question
amounts to finding the optimal strategy for building up cluster states, from
the perspective of classical control. We develop a notion of classical
strategies, and present rigorous statements on the ultimate maximal and minimal
use of resources of the globally optimal strategy. We find that this strategy -
being also the most robust with respect to decoherence - gives rise to an
advantage of already more than an order of magnitude in the number of maximally
entangled pairs when building chains with an expected length of L=40, compared
to other legitimate strategies. For two-dimensional cluster states, we present
a first scheme achieving the optimal quadratic asymptotic scaling. This
analysis shows that the choice of appropriate classical control leads to a very
significant reduction in resource consumption.

from a certain local causality requirement (``Bell Locality'') and the
empirically well-supported predictions of quantum theory for the standard
EPR-Bell setup. The demonstrated hidden variables are precisely those needed
for the derivation of the Bell Inequalities. We thus refute the widespread view
that empirical violations of Bell Inequalities leave open a choice of whether
to reject (i) locality or (ii) hidden variables. Both principles are indeed
assumed in the derivation of the inequalities, but since, as we demonstrate
here, (ii) actually follows from (i), there is no choice but to blame the
violation of Bell's Inequality on (i). Our main conclusion is thus that no Bell
Local theory can be consistent with what is known from experiment about the
correlations exhibited by separated particles. Aside from our conclusion being
based on a different sense of locality this conclusion resembles one that has
been advocated recently by H.P. Stapp. We therefore also carefully contrast the

specifically a single atom in a driven optical cavity with cavity loss and
spontaneous emission. The system reaches a steady pure state when driven very
weakly. Under these conditions, there is an optimal value for atom-field
coupling to maximize entanglement, as larger coupling favors a loss port due to
the cavity enhanced spontaneous emission. We address ways to implement
measurements of entanglement witnesses and find that normalized
cross-correlation functions are indicators of the entanglement in the system.
The magnitude of the equal time intensity-field cross correlation between the
transmitted field of the cavity and the fluorescence intensity is proportional
to the concurrence for weak driving fields.

can rise non-local correlations. However, for almost forty years, it has been
assumed that the most non-local states would be the maximally entangled ones.
Surprisingly it is not the case: non-maximally entangled states are generally
more non-local than maximally entangled states for all the measures of
non-locality proposed to date: Bell inequalities, the Kullback-Leibler
distance, entanglement simulation with communication or with non-local boxes,
the detection loophole and efficiency of cryptography. In fact, one can even
find simple examples in low dimensions, confirming that it is not an artefact
of a specifically constructed Hilbert space or topology. This anomaly shows
that entanglement and non-locality are not only different concepts, but also
truly different resources. We review the present knowledge on this anomaly,
point out that Hardy's theorem has the same feature, and discuss the

  perturbation analysis</title><description>  Seeking for a relativistic generalisation of the non-relativistic
Schroedinger equation, one very soon arrives at equations with a square-root
operator by having applied the quantum mechanical correspondence principle to
the formula of relativistic energy. The problems of these equations are at
least two fold: when coupled to an electromagnetic field, their relativistic
invariance is not evident or even doubtful and due to their non-local
character, it seems to be that they cannot be maintained mathematically in an
easy way. For spin-1/2 particles, these difficulties can be overcome by the
Dirac equation, which leads e.g. to the prediction of binding energies of an
electron in a hydrogen atom that are compatible with experimental results up to
the forth order of the fine structure constant, inclusively. Ignoring the
problem with relativistic invariance, one may ask, if there exists a
square-root equation, for which one can achieve the same good agreement with
experiments for the latter physical system. It is going to be shown, that the
answer to this question is affirmative and does not exceed the skills obtained
in a course about non-relativistic quantum mechanics and physics of atoms,
respectively.

aspect of hidden variable theory (HVT). We consider successive measurements of
non-commuting operators on a input spin $s$ state. The key point is that,
although these operators are non-commuting, they act on different states so
that the joint probabilities for the outputs of successive measurements are
well defined. We show that, in this scenario HVT leads to Bell type
inequalities for the correlation between the outputs of successive
measurements. We account for the maximum violation of these inequalities by
quantum correlations by varying spin value and the number of successive
measurements. Our approach can be used to obtain a measure of the deviation of
QM from realism say in terms of the amount of information needed to be
transferred between successive measurements in order to classically simulate
the quantum correlations.

The result can be seen as a discrete version of Hudson's Theorem. Hudson
established that for continuous variable systems, the Wigner function of a pure

mixed states, it might be surmised that only convex combinations of stabilizer
states give rise to non-negative Wigner distributions. We refute this

transport shows perfect recurrences, when the initial excitation starts at the
central node. For larger dendrimers, the recurrence ceases to be perfect, a
fact which resembles results for discrete quantum carpets. Moreover, depending
on the initial excitation site we find that the coherent transport to certain
nodes of the dendrimer has a very low probability. When the initial excitation
starts from the central node, the problem can be mapped onto a line which
simplifies the computational effort. Furthermore, the long time average of the
quantum mechanical transition probabilities between pairs of nodes show
characteristic patterns and allow to classify the nodes into clusters with
identical limiting probabilities. For the (space) average of the quantum

define states on spacelike surfaces and their unitary evolution between them.
Quantum theory has changed as our conceptions of space and time have evolved.
But quantum mechanics needs to be generalized further for quantum gravity where
spacetime geometry is fluctuating and without definite value. This paper
reviews a fully four-dimensional, sum-over-histories, generalized quantum
mechanics of cosmological spacetime geometry. This generalization is
constructed within the framework of generalized quantum theory. This is a
minimal set of principles for quantum theory abstracted from the modern quantum
mechanics of closed systems, most generally the universe. In this
generalization, states of fields on spacelike surfaces and their unitary
evolution are emergent properties appropriate when spacetime geometry behaves
approximately classically. The principles of generalized quantum theory allow
for the further generalization that would be necessary were spacetime not
fundamental. Emergent spacetime phenomena are discussed in general and
illustrated with the example of the classical spacetime geometries with large
spacelike surfaces that emerge from the `no-boundary' wave function of the
universe. These must be Lorentzian with one, and only one, time direction. The
essay concludes by raising the question of whether quantum mechanics itself is
emergent.

states when only a single copy is available and the parties are restricted to
local operations and classical communication, but with the additional
requirement that entanglement must be preserved in the process. Several general
theorems aimed at characterizing sets of states with which the parties can
succeed in such a task are proven. These include (1) a maximum for the number
of states when the Schmidt rank of every outcome must be at least a given
minimum; (2) an upper bound (equal to the dimension of Hilbert space if
entanglement need not be preserved) for the sum over Schmidt ranks of the
initial states when only one-way classical communication is allowed; and (3)
separately, a necessary and a sufficient condition on the states such that
their original Schmidt ranks can always be preserved. It is shown that our
bound on the sum of Schmidt ranks can be exceeded if two-way communication is
permitted, and this includes the case that entanglement need not be preserved,
so that this sum can exceed the dimension of Hilbert space. Such questions,
concerning how the various results are effected by the resources used by the
parties are addressed for each theorem. This subject is closely related to the
problem of locally purifying an entangled state from a mixed state, which is of
direct relevance to teleportation and dense coding using a mixed-state
resource. In an appendix, I give an extremely simple and transparent proof of
&quot;non-locality without entanglement&quot;, a phenomenon originally discussed by
Bennett and co-workers several years ago.

isotropic Heisenberg interaction is studied, as a model for the spin
decoherence in quantum dots. The time-dependent polarization of the central
spin is calculated as a function of the bath-spin distribution and the
polarizations of the initial bath state. For short times, the polarization of
the central spin shows a gaussian decay, and at later times it revives
displaying nonmonotonic time dependence. The decoherence time scale dep ends on
moments of the bath-spin distribuition, and also on the polarization strengths
in various bath-spin channels. The bath polarizations have a tendency to
increase the decoherence time scale. The effective dynamics of the central spin
polarization is shown to be describ ed by a master equation with non-markovian
features.

interacting four-level systems which model the relevant level scheme of Ba+
ions. For the latter, a huge rate of double and triple jumps was reported in a

the experiment there is practically no effect. Consequently it seems that the
dipole-dipole interaction can be ruled out as a possible explanation for the

problem. A number of example Hamiltonian oracles are studied in this paper,
including oracle interrogation and the problem of computing the XOR of the

Moreover, through deriving out the improved forms of the zeroth, first, second

Then we apply our scheme to obtain the improved forms of perturbed energy and

  In the present note this entropy result is extended to the infinite

entanglement problem is discussed for spin 1/2, entangled Markov chains
generated by a binary symmetric channel with hopping probability $1-q$. The von
Neumann entropy of these states, restricted on a sublattice is explicitly
calculated and shown to be independent of the size of the sublattice. This is a

  Finally the entanglement property between the sublattices ${\cal

  Merging many-body perturbation theory with QED</title><description>  A formalism for energy-dependent many-body perturbation theory (MBPT),
previously indicated in our recent review articles (Lindgren et al., Phys.Rep.
389,161(2004), Can.J.Phys. 83,183(2005)), is developed in more detail. The
formalism allows for a mixture of energy-dependent (retarded) and
energy-independent (instantaneous) interactions and hence for a merger of QED
and standard (relativistic) MBPT. This combination is particularly important
for light elements, such as light heliumlike ions, where electron correlation
is pronounced. It can also be quite significant in the medium-heavy mass range,
as recently discussed by Fritzsche et al. (J.Phys. B38,S707(2005)), with the
consequence that the effects might be significant also in analyzing the data of
experiments with highly charged ions. A numerical procedure for treating the
combined effect is described, and some preliminary numerical results are given
for heliumlike ions. This represent the first numerical evaluation of effects
beyond two-photon exchange involving a retarded interaction. It is found that
for heliumlike neon the effect of one retarded photon (with Coulomb
interactions of all orders) represents about 99% of the non-radiative effects
beyond energy-independent MBPT.

bodies and atoms is given. It is based on the ground-state Lorentz force
density acting on the charge and current densities attributed to the
polarization and magnetization in linearly, locally, and causally responding
media. The theory is applied to dielectric macro- and micro-objects, including
single atoms. Existing formulas valid for weakly polarizable matter are
generalized to allow also for strongly polarizable matter. In particular when
micro-objects can be regarded as single atoms, well-known formulas for the
Casimir-Polder force on atoms and the van der Waals interaction between atoms
are recovered. It is shown that the force acting on medium atoms--in contrast
to isolated atoms--is in general screened by the other medium atoms.

  Bell's theorem</title><description>  The famous ``spooky action at a distance'' in the EPR-szenario is shown to be
a local interaction, once entanglement is interpreted as a kind of ``nearest
neighbor'' relation among quantum systems. Furthermore, the wave function
itself is interpreted as encoding the ``nearest neighbor'' relations between a
quantum system and spatial points. This interpretation becomes natural, if we
view space and distance in terms of relations among spatial points. Therefore,
``position'' becomes a purely relational concept. This relational picture leads
to a new perspective onto the quantum mechanical formalism, where many of the
``weird'' aspects, like the particle-wave duality, the non-locality of
entanglement, or the ``mystery'' of the double-slit experiment, disappear.
Furthermore, this picture cirumvents the restrictions set by Bell's
inequalities, i.e., a possible (realistic) hidden variable theory based on
these concepts can be local and at the same time reproduce the results of
quantum mechanics.

double symmetry breaking. We devise a criterion for this type of symmetry
breaking which is more general than the one existing in the literature, and
therefore extends the number of possible breaking patterns that can be
described consistently. We start by recalling why the extended symmetry notion
of quantum double algebras is an optimal tool when analyzing a wide variety of
two dimensional physical systems including quantum fluids, crystals and liquid
crystals. The power of this approach stems from the fact that one may
characterize both ordinary and topological modes as representations of a single
(generally non-Abelian) Hopf symmetry. In principle a full classification of
defect mediated as well as ordinary symmetry breaking patterns and subsequent
confinement phenomena can be given. The formalism applies equally well to
systems exhibiting global, local, internal and/or external (i.e. spatial)
symmetries. The subtle differences in interpretation for the various situations
are pointed out. We show that the Hopf symmetry breaking formalism reproduces
the known results for ordinary (electric) condensates, and we derive formulae
for defect (magnetic) condensates which also involve the phenomenon of symmetry
restoration. These results are applied in two papers which will be published in
parallel.

made against it with a certain error tolerance. We investigate two distinct
types of reference frame: a reference direction, realized by a spin-j system,
and a phase reference, realized by an oscillator mode with bounded energy. For
both cases, we show that our measure of longevity increases quadratically with
the size of the reference system and is therefore non-additive. For instance,
the number of measurements that a directional reference frame consisting of N
parallel spins can be put to use scales as N^2. Our results quantify the extent

operations from an ancillary space of M infinitely entangled bonds connecting
neighboring sites, applied at each of N sites of an harmonic chain. Replacing
the projections by associated Gaussian states, the 'building blocks', we show
that the entanglement range in translationally-invariant Gaussian matrix
product states depends on how entangled the building blocks are. In particular,
infinite entanglement in the building blocks produces fully symmetric Gaussian
states with maximum entanglement range. From their peculiar properties of
entanglement sharing, a basic difference with spin chains is revealed: Gaussian
matrix product states can possess unlimited, long-range entanglement even with
minimum number of ancillary bonds (M=1). Finally we discuss how these states

adding (subtracting) photons to Gaussian fields. Interestingly, when photons
are added to classical Gaussian fields, the resulting states exhibit {\em

coherent and thermal states. Here, we study the non-classical features of such

up in the negativity of the Wigner function. We also work out the {\em
entanglement potential}, a recently proposed measure of non-classicality for
these states. Our analysis reveals that photon added coherent states are
non-classical for all seed beam intensities; their non-classicality increases
with the addition of more number of photons. Thermal state exhibits
non-classicality at all temperatures, when a photon is added; lower the

We analyze the conditional quantum evolution (quantum trajectories) to

measurement of a quantum system. I minimize the distortion of measurement and
maximize the quality of the outcome by finding the optimal (covariant)
instrument. In order to optimize this joint restriction, the family of
covariant instruments is classified. This is an important side result.

  Decoding</title><description>  Hardcore functions have been used as a technical tool to construct secure
cryptographic systems; however, little is known on their quantum counterpart,
called quantum hardcore functions. With a new insight into fundamental
properties of quantum hardcores, we present three new quantum hardcore
functions for any (strong) quantum one-way function. We also give a &quot;quantum&quot;
solution to Damgard's question (CRYPTO'88) on a classical hardcore property of
his pseudorandom generator, by proving its quantum hardcore property. Our major
technical tool is the new notion of quantum list-decoding of &quot;classical&quot;
error-correcting codes (rather than &quot;quantum&quot; error-correcting codes), which is
defined on the platform of computational complexity theory and computational
cryptography (rather than information theory). In particular, we give a simple
but powerful criterion that makes a polynomial-time computable classical block
code (seen as a function) a quantum hardcore for all quantum one-way functions.
On their own interest, we construct efficient quantum list-decoding algorithms
for classical block codes whose associated quantum states (called codeword
states) form a nearly phase-orthogonal basis.

  3-Satisfiability Problem</title><description>  In this paper we show that the performance of the quantum adiabatic algorithm
is determined by phase transitions in underlying problem in the presence of
transverse magnetic field $\Gamma$. We show that the quantum version of random
Satisfiability problem with 3 bits in a clause (3-SAT) has a first-order
quantum phase transition. We analyze the phase diagram $\gamma=\gamma(\Gamma)$
where $\gamma$ is an average number of clauses per binary variable in 3-SAT.
The results are obtained in a closed form assuming replica symmetry and
neglecting time correlations at small values of the transverse field $\Gamma$.
In the limit of $\Gamma=0$ the value of $\gamma(0)\approx$ 5.18 corresponds to
that given by the replica symmetric treatment of a classical random 3-SAT
problem. We demonstrate the qualitative similarity between classical and
quantum versions of this problem.

consisting of an electron in a quantum dot interacting with the spins of the
nuclei (N) in the dot due to hyperfine interaction is solved exactly for a
given arbitrary initial state. The electron spin dynamics is then expressed in
terms of the reduced density matrix of the composite system by computing the
marginal density matrix of the electron. This is accomplished by classifying
states of the system by the total spin of the coupled electron and nuclear
system that commutes with the system Hamiltonian. These states are used in
enumerating and finding the exact solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger
equation. In each sector of the total spin, the problem reduces to solving a
linear simultaneous set of equations that are solved by matrix inversion. Such
solutions enable one to make a reliable approximate scheme for purposes of
numerical estimation of the various physical quantities. A methematical and
physical discussion of this procedure with the density matrix approach to this

is determined by diffusion over oscillator quasienergy, provided the relaxation
rate exceeds the rate of interstate tunneling. The diffusion has quantum origin
and accompanies relaxation to the stable state. We find the semiclassical
distribution over quasienergy. For T=0, where the system has detailed balance,
this distribution differs from the distribution for $T\to 0$; the T=0

Strong coupling of the qubit to the resonator leads to a significant ac-Stark

the photon number populating the resonator cause dephasing of the qubit. We
find good agreement between the predicted line shape of the qubit spectrum and

the Stark shift per photon is large compared to the cavity decay rate and the
qubit linewidth, we predict that the qubit spectrum will be split into multiple

Bethe ansatz solution, into the quasi-exactly solvable spectrum of a one-body
Schr\&quot;odinger operator. Bifurcations of the minima for the potential of the

crossover is not dependent on the existence of a thermodynamic limit, rendering
applications to finite systems feasible. We study two examples of bosonic

is treated using Laplace transform methods applied to the coupled amplitude
equations. Results are also obtained from master equations by two different
approaches, that is, involving either pseudomodes or quasimodes. Two different
types of reservoir are considered, namely a high-Q cavity and a photonic
band-gap system, in which the respective reservoir structure functions involve
Lorentzians. Non-resonant transitions are included in the model. In all cases
non-Markovian behaviour for the atomic system can be found, such as oscillatory
decay for the high-Q cavity case and population trapping for the photonic
band-gap case. In the master equation approaches, the atomic system is
augmented by a small number of pseudomodes or quasimodes, which in the
quasimode approach themselves undergo Markovian relaxation into a flat
reservoir of continuum quasimodes. Results from these methods are found to be
identical to those from the Laplace transform method including two-photon
excitation of the reservoir with both emitting sequences. This shows that
complicated non-Markovian decays of an atomic system into structured EM field
reservoirs can be described by Markovian models for the atomic system coupled

state entanglement entropy per unit area equals $1/(4G_N)$, where $G_N$ is the

spacetime dimensions, is performed. These black holes live in an anti-de Sitter
spacetime, i.e., a spacetime with negative cosmological constant. To find the
entropy, the approach developed by Solodukhin is followed. The method consists
in a redefinition of the variables in the metric, by considering the radial
coordinate as a scalar field. Then one performs a 2+(D-2) dimensional
reduction, where the (D-2) dimensions are in the angular coordinates, obtaining
a 2-dimensional effective scalar field theory. This theory is a conformal
theory in an infinitesimally small vicinity of the horizon. The corresponding
conformal symmetry will then have conserved charges, associated with its
infinitesimal conformal generators, which will generate a classical Poisson
algebra of the Virasoro type. Shifting the charges and replacing Poisson
brackets by commutators, one recovers the usual form of the Virasoro algebra,
obtaining thus the level zero conserved charge eigenvalue L_0, and a nonzero

Quantum k-SAT is a problem of verifying whether there exists n-qubit pure state

  Qubit-Qutrit Systems</title><description>  We investigate the possibility of deriving analytical formulas for the
15-dimensional separable volumes, in terms of any of a number of metrics of
interest (Hilbert-Schmidt [HS], Bures,...), of the two-qubit (four-level)
systems. This would appear to require 15-fold symbolic integrations over a
complicated convex body (defined by both separability and feasibility
constraints). The associated 15-dimensional integrands -- in terms of the
Tilma-Byrd-Sudarshan Euler-angle-based parameterization of the 4 x 4 density
matrices \rho (math-ph/0202002) -- would be the products of 12-dimensional Haar
measure \mu_{Haar} (common to each metric) and 3-dimensional measures
\mu_{metric} (specific to each metric) over the 3d-simplex formed by the four
eigenvalues of \rho. We attempt here to estimate/determine the 3-dimensional
integrands (the products of the various [known] \mu_{metric}'s and an unknown
symmetric weighting function W) remaining after the (putative) 12-fold
integration of \mu_{Haar} over the twelve Euler angles. We do this by fitting W
so that the conjectured HS separable volumes and hyperareas (quant-ph/0410238;
cf. quant-ph/0609006) are reproduced. We further evaluate a number of possible
choices of W by seeing how well they also yield the conjectured separable
volumes for the Bures, Kubo-Mori, Wigner-Yanase and (arithmetic) average
monotone metrics and the conjectured separable Bures hyperarea
(quant-ph/0308037,Table VI). We, in fact, find two such exact (rather similar)
choices that give these five conjectured (non-HS) values all within 5%. In
addition to the above-mentioned Euler angle parameterization of \rho, we make
extensive use of the Bloore parameterization (J. Phys. A 9 [1976], 2059) in a
companion set of two-qubit separability analyses.

  theoretic perspective</title><description>  Is the universe computable? If yes, is it computationally a polynomial place?
In standard quantum mechanics, which permits infinite parallelism and the
infinitely precise specification of states, a negative answer to both questions
is not ruled out. On the other hand, empirical evidence suggests that
NP-complete problems are intractable in the physical world. Likewise,
computational problems known to be algorithmically uncomputable do not seem to
be computable by any physical means. We suggest that this close correspondence
between the efficiency and power of abstract algorithms on the one hand, and
physical computers on the other, finds a natural explanation if the universe is
assumed to be algorithmic; that is, that physical reality is the product of
discrete sub-physical information processing equivalent to the actions of a
probabilistic Turing machine. This assumption can be reconciled with the
observed exponentiality of quantum systems at microscopic scales, and the
consequent possibility of implementing Shor's quantum polynomial time algorithm
at that scale, provided the degree of superposition is intrinsically, finitely
upper-bounded. If this bound is associated with the quantum-classical divide
(the Heisenberg cut), a natural resolution to the quantum measurement problem
arises. From this viewpoint, macroscopic classicality is an evidence that the
universe is in BPP, and both questions raised above receive affirmative
answers. A recently proposed computational model of quantum measurement, which
relates the Heisenberg cut to the discreteness of Hilbert space, is briefly
discussed. A connection to quantum gravity is noted. Our results are compatible
with the philosophy that mathematical truths are independent of the laws of
physics.

interferometer cannot be adequately characterized by the standard deviation,
such as $\Delta\phi\sim 1/\sqrt{N}$ (the standard limit), or $\Delta\phi\sim
1/N$ (the Heisenberg limit). We propose an alternative measure of phase
sensitivity--the fidelity of an interferometer--defined as the Shannon mutual
information between the phase shift $\phi$\ and the measurement outcomes $m$.
As an example application of interferometer fidelity, we consider a generic
optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer, used as a sensor of a classical field. We

The time

additional term of the Lindblad form, the socalled dissipator. We show that,
after enlarging the original Hilbert space by states which represent the decay

``particle decay''-- can be incorporated into the dissipator of the enlarged

representation U_{mu+nu} for Young diagrams mu and nu. U_{mu+nu} is contained
in the tensor product of U_mu and U_nu; let xi be the state obtained by tracing
out U_nu. We show that xi is close to a convex combination of states Uv, where
U is in U(d) and v is the highest weight vector in U_mu. When U_{mu+nu} is the
symmetric representation, this yields the conventional quantum de Finetti
theorem for symmetric states, and our method of proof gives near-optimal bounds
for the approximation of xi by a convex combination of product states. For the
class of symmetric Werner states, we give a second de Finetti-style theorem
(our 'half' theorem); the de Finetti-approximation in this case takes a
particularly simple form, involving only product states with a fixed spectrum.
Our proof uses purely group theoretic methods, and makes a link with the
shifted Schur functions. It also provides some useful examples, and gives some
insight into the structure of the set of convex combinations of product states.

  Basis and Wigner Quantum Oscillators</title><description>  An explicit construction of all finite-dimensional irreducible
representations of the Lie superalgebra gl(1|n) in a Gel'fand-Zetlin basis is
given. Particular attention is paid to the so-called star type I
representations (``unitary representations''), and to a simple class of
representations V(p), with p any positive integer. Then, the notion of Wigner
Quantum Oscillators (WQOs) is recalled. In these quantum oscillator models, the
unitary representations of gl(1|DN) are physical state spaces of the N-particle
D-dimensional oscillator. So far, physical properties of gl(1|DN) WQOs were
described only in the so-called Fock spaces W(p), leading to interesting
concepts such as non-commutative coordinates and a discrete spatial structure.
Here, we describe physical properties of WQOs for other unitary
representations, including certain representations V(p) of gl(1|DN). These new
solutions again have remarkable properties following from the spectrum of the
Hamiltonian and of the position, momentum, and angular momentum operators.
Formulae are obtained that give the angular momentum content of all the
representations V(p) of gl(1|3N), associated with the N-particle 3-dimensional
WQO. For these representations V(p) we also consider in more detail the
spectrum of the position operators and their squares, leading to interesting
consequences. In particular, a classical limit of these solutions is obtained,
that is in agreement with the correspondence principle.

of the harmonic oscillator is studied. A generalization of the fundamental
constraints on quantum mechanical diffusion coefficients which appear in the
master equation for the damped quantum oscillator is presented; the
Schr\&quot;odinger and Heisenberg representations of the Lindblad equation are given
explicitly. On the basis of these representations it is shown that various
master equations for the damped quantum oscillator used in the literature are
particular cases of the Lindblad equation and that the majority of these
equations are not satisfying the constraints on quantum mechanical diffusion
coefficients. Analytical expressions for the first two moments of coordinate
and momentum are also obtained by using the characteristic function of the
Lindblad master equation. The master equation is transformed into Fokker-Planck
equations for quasiprobability distributions. A comparative study is made for
the Glauber $P$ representation, the antinormal ordering $Q$ representation and
the Wigner $W$ representation. It is proven that the variances for the damped
harmonic oscillator found with these representations are the same. By solving
the Fokker-Planck equations in the steady state, it is shown that the
quasiprobability distributions are two-dimensional Gaussians with widths
determined by the diffusion coefficients. The density matrix is represented via
a generating function, which is obtained by solving a time-dependent linear
partial differential equation derived from the master equation. Illustrative
examples for specific initial conditions of the density matrix are provided.

of the Klein-Gordon equation. This expression involves a one-parameter family
of conserved current densities J_a^\mu, with a\in(-1,1), that are analogous to
the chiral current density for spin half fields. The conservation of J_a^\mu is
related to a global gauge symmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields whose gauge group
is U(1) for rational a and the multiplicative group of positive real numbers
for irrational a. We show that the associated gauge symmetry is responsible for
the conservation of the total probability of the localization of the field in

from the fact that the probability current density for free scalar fields is
neither covariant nor conserved. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of
our approach for free real scalar fields offering a direct proof of the
uniqueness of the relativistically invariant positive-definite inner product on
the space of real Klein-Gordon fields. We also explore an extension of our

absorption of samples of tied photons. The quantum dynamics results from the
collective behavior of such a swarm where the eigenstates are treated as the
equilibrium states relatively to emission-absorption of photons. The
entanglement is treated as a correlation between samples of the different
swarms that is stored in the space-time part of the model inaccessible for a

magnetic interaction will govern spin decay, after other sources, such as the

  The Influence of External Electric Field</title><description>  Fluctuations of the electromagnetic field produced by quantized matter in

spectrum of fluctuations is derived within the long-range expansion. It is
found that in the whole measured frequency band, the power spectrum of
fluctuations exhibits an inverse frequency dependence. A general argument is
given showing that for all practically relevant values of the electric field,
the power spectrum of induced fluctuations is proportional to the field
strength squared. As an illustration, the power spectrum is calculated
explicitly using the kinetic model with the relaxation-type collision term.
Finally, it is shown that the magnitude of fluctuations produced by a sample
generally has a Gaussian distribution around its mean value, and its dependence

for geometrically similar samples, the power spectrum is inversely proportional
to the sample volume. Application of the obtained results to the problem of

One copy of each of the unknown states is provided as input, or program, for
the two program registers, and the data state, which is guaranteed to be
prepared in one of the program states, is fed into the data register of the
device. This device will then tell us, in an optimal way, which of the

case, we know one of the states while the other is unknown. One copy of the
unknown state is fed into the single program register, and the data state which
is guaranteed to be prepared in either the program state or the known state, is
fed into the data register. The device will then tell us, again optimally,
whether the data state matches the template or is the known state. We determine
two types of optimal devices. The first performs discrimination with minimum

  entangled states</title><description>  Entanglement is usually associated with compound systems. We first show that
a one-dimensional (1D) completed scattering of a particle on a static potential
barrier represents an entanglement of two alternative one-particle
sub-processes, transmission and reflection, macroscopically distinct at the
final stage of scattering. The wave function for the whole ensemble of
scattering particles can be uniquely presented as the sum of two isometrically
evolved wave packets to describe the (to-be-)transmitted and (to-be-)reflected
subensembles of particles at all stages of scattering. A noninvasive
Larmor-clock timing procedure adapted to either subensemble shows that namely
the dwell time gives the time spent, on the average, by a particle in the
barrier region, and it denies the Hartman effect. As regards the group time, it
cannot be measured and hence it cannot be accepted as a measure of the
tunneling time. We argue that nonlocality of entangled states appears in
quantum mechanics due to inconsistency of its superposition principle with the
corpuscular properties of a particle. For example, this principle associates a
1D completed scattering with a single (one-way) process, while a particle, as
an indivisible object, cannot take part in transmission and reflection,
simultaneously.

phenomenon. It appears in quantum mechanics as a consequence of the
inconsistency of its superposition principle with the corpuscular properties of
a quantum particle. In the existing form, this principle does not distinguish
between macroscopically distinct states of a particle and their superpositions:
it implies introducing observables for a particle, even if it is in an
entangled state. However, a particle cannot take part simultaneously in two or
more alternative macroscopically distinct sub-processes. Thus, calculating the
expectation values of the one-particle's observables, for entangled states, is
physically meaningless: Born's formula is not applicable to such states. The
same concerns the entangled states of compound quantum systems. In the {\it
existing} quantum mechanics, introducing Bell's inequalities is fully legal.
However, these inequalities imply averaging over an entangled state, and,
hence, they have no basis for their clear physical interpretation. Experiments
to confirm the violation of Bell's inequalities do not prove the existence of
nonlocality in microcosm. They confirm only that correlations introduced in the

  quantum gate</title><description>  Quantum computation has attracted much attention, among other things, due to
its potentialities to solve classical NP problems in polynomial time. For this
reason, there has been a growing interest to build a quantum computer. One of
the basic steps is to implement the quantum circuit able to realize a given
unitary operation. This task has been solved using decomposition of unitary
matrices in simpler ones till reach quantum circuits having only single-qubits
and CNOTs gates. Usually the goal is to find the minimal quantum circuit able
to solve a given problem. In this paper we go in a different direction. We
propose a general quantum circuit able to implement any specific quantum
circuit by just setting correctly the parameters. In other words, we propose a
programmable quantum circuit. This opens the possibility to construct a real
quantum computer where several different quantum operations can be realized in
the same hardware. The configuration is proposed and its optical implementation
is discussed.

ubiquitous in quantum control and quantum information processing. We
investigate two scenarios where randomized dynamical decoupling techniques
become more advantageous with respect to standard deterministic methods in
switching off unwanted dynamical evolution in a closed quantum system: when
dealing with decoupling cycles which involve a large number of control actions
and/or when seeking long-time quantum information storage. Highly effective
hybrid decoupling schemes, which combine deterministic and stochastic features
are discussed, as well as the benefits of sequentially implementing a
concatenated method, applied at short times, followed by a hybrid protocol,
employed at longer times. A quantum register consisting of a chain of spin-1/2
particles interacting via the Heisenberg interaction is used as a model for the
analysis throughout.

detail by using a scheme in which all pure states in the 2-qubit Hilbert space
are utilized for strategies. We consider two different types of symmetric games
exemplified by the familiar games, the Battle of the Sexes (BoS) and the
Prisoners' Dilemma (PD). These two types of symmetric games are shown to be
related by a duality map, which ensures that they share common phase structures
with respect to the equilibria of the strategies. We find eight distinct phase
structures possible for the symmetric games, which are determined by the
classical payoff matrices from which the quantum games are defined. We also
discuss the possibility of resolving the dilemmas in the classical BoS, PD and
the Stag Hunt (SH) game based on the phase structures obtained in the quantum

the BoS, while it generically can for the PD and SH if appropriate correlations

There is additional freedom in how the ensemble is chosen. When the field mode

outperforms all existing asymptotic schemes. This protocol is based on the
breeding protocol with the incorporation of two-way classical communication.
Like breeding, the protocol starts with an infinite number of copies of a
Bell-diagonal mixed state. Breeding can be carried out as successive stages of
partial information extraction, yielding the same result: one bit of
information is gained at the cost (measurement) of one pure Bell state pair
(ebit). The basic principle of our protocol is at every stage to replace
measurements on ebits by measurements on a finite number of copies, whenever
there are two equiprobable outcomes. In that case, the entropy of the global
state is reduced by more than one bit. Therefore, every such replacement
results in an improvement of the protocol. We explain how our protocol is
organized as to have as many replacements as possible. The yield is then
calculated for Werner states.

of spontaneous wave function collapse, a major challenge in the foundations of
quantum mechanics is to devise a relativistic quantum theory without observers.
One of the difficulties is to reconcile nonlocality with relativity. I report
about recent progress in this direction based on the GRW model: A relativistic
version of the model has been devised for the case of N noninteracting (but
entangled) particles. A key ingredient was to focus not on the evolution of the
wave function but rather on the evolution of the matter in space-time as
determined by the wave function.

networks with the tight-binding approach for different types of
nearest-neighbor interactions. For various geometrical configurations, these
networks can function as some optical devices, such as beam splitters and
interferometers. When the Bloch electrons with the Gaussian wave packets input
these devices, various quantum coherence phenomena can be observed, e.g., the
perfect quantum state transfer without reflection in a Y-shaped beam, the
multi- mode entanglers of electron wave by star shaped network and Bloch
electron interferometer with the lattice Aharonov-Bohm effects. Behind these
conceptual quantum devices are the physical mechanism that, for hopping
parameters with some specific values, a connected quantum networks can be
reduced into a virtual network, which is a direct sum of some irreducible
subnetworks. Thus, the perfect quantum state transfer in each subnetwork in
this virtual network can be regarded as a coherent beam splitting process.
Analytical and numerical investigations show the controllability of wave packet
motion in these quantum networks by the magnetic flux through some loops of
these networks, or by adjusting the couplings on nodes. We find the essential
differences in these quantum coherence effects when the different wave packets
enter these quantum networks initially. With these quantum coherent features,
they are expected to be used as quantum information processors for the fermion
system based on the possible engineered solid state systems, such as the array
of quantum dots that can be implemented experimentally.

coupled to gravity in this framework. A Hamiltonian operator for the scalar
field can be well defined in the coupled diffeomorphism invariant Hilbert
space, which is both self-adjoint and positive. On the other hand, the
Hamiltonian constraint operator for the scalar field coupled to gravity can be
well defined in the coupled kinematical Hilbert space. There are 1-parameter
ambiguities due to scalar field in the construction of both operators. The
results heighten our confidence that there is no divergence within this
background independent and diffeomorphism invariant quantization approach of
matter coupled to gravity. Moreover, to avoid possible quantum anomaly, the
master constraint programme can be carried out in this coupled system by
employing a self-adjoint master constraint operator on the diffeomorphism

and other complex classical dynamical systems. Emergent non-commutivity due to
the fractal nature of sample trajectories is closely related to the fact that
the forward and backward time derivatives are different for these diffusions. A
new variational approach to stochastic mechanics based on trace dynamics is
introduced. It is shown that Yasue's method and Guerra and Morato's method can
both be generalized to allow for any diffusion constant in a stochastic model
of Schrodinger's equation, and that they can all also describe dissipative
diffusion. Then it is shown that the trace dynamical theory seems to only
describe dissipative diffusion unless an extra quantum mechanical potential
term is added to the Hamiltonian.
  The differential space theory of Wiener and Siegel is reconsidered as a
useful tool in this framework, and is generalized to stochastic processes
instead of deterministic ones for the hidden trajectories of observables. It is
proposed that the natural measure space for Wiener-Siegel theory is Haar
measure for random unitary matrices. A new interpretation of the polychotomic

that the criticism may not be a forgone conclusion, we point out the virtually

In this scenario a quantum measurement is a non-equilibrium phase transition in

mechanical wavefunction acquire substantial meaning in this picture, and the
probabilistic element is removed from the foundations of quantum mechanics, its

Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, Schrodinger's Cat paradox, first and higher
order coherence of photons and atoms, virtual particles, the existence of

The expectation value of any arbitrary ``good'' local observable, expressed as

  Search and Global Optimization</title><description>  We focus on determining the separability of an unknown bipartite quantum
state $\rho$ by invoking a sufficiently large subset of all possible
entanglement witnesses given the expected value of each element of a set of
mutually orthogonal observables. We review the concept of an entanglement
witness from the geometrical point of view and use this geometry to show that
the set of separable states is not a polytope and to characterize the class of
entanglement witnesses (observables) that detect entangled states on opposite
sides of the set of separable states. All this serves to motivate a classical
algorithm which, given the expected values of a subset of an orthogonal basis
of observables of an otherwise unknown quantum state, searches for an
entanglement witness in the span of the subset of observables. The idea of such
an algorithm, which is an efficient reduction of the quantum separability
problem to a global optimization problem, was introduced in PRA 70 060303(R),
where it was shown to be an improvement on the naive approach for the quantum
separability problem (exhaustive search for a decomposition of the given state
into a convex combination of separable states). The last section of the paper
discusses in more generality such algorithms, which, in our case, assume a
subroutine that computes the global maximum of a real function of several

sufficiently well on small instances that they will render a feasible test for
separability in some cases of interest (e.g. in 3-by-3 dimensional systems).

that the underlying system dynamics represented by a quantum stochastic
differential equation must be known exactly in order that the corresponding
filter provides an optimal performance; however, this assumption is generally
unrealistic. Therefore, in this paper, we consider a class of linear quantum
systems subjected to time-varying norm-bounded parametric uncertainties and
then propose a robust observer such that the variance of the estimation error
is guaranteed to be within a certain bound. Although in the linear case much of
classical control theory can be applied to quantum systems, the quantum robust
observer obtained in this paper does not have a classical analogue due to the
system's specific structure with respect to the uncertainties. Moreover, by
considering a typical quantum control problem, we show that the proposed robust
observer is fairly robust against a parametric uncertainty of the system even
when the other estimators--the optimal Kalman filter and risk-sensitive
observer--fail in the estimation.

from the TE mode is dominated by low frequencies, for which the dielectric

  Purely Operational Axioms</title><description>  In the present paper I show how it is possible to derive the Hilbert space
formulation of Quantum Mechanics from a comprehensive definition of &quot;physical
experiment&quot; and assuming &quot;experimental accessibility and simplicity&quot; as
specified by five simple Postulates. This accomplishes the program presented in
form of conjectures in the previous paper quant-ph/0506034. Pivotal roles are
played by the &quot;local observability principle&quot;, which reconciles the holism of
nonlocality with the reductionism of local observation, and by the postulated
existence of &quot;informationally complete observables&quot; and of a &quot;symmetric
faithful state&quot;. This last notion allows one to introduce an operational
definition for the real version of the &quot;adjoint&quot;--i. e. the transposition--from
which one can derive a real Hilbert-space structure via either the
Mackey-Kakutani or the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal constructions. Here I analyze in
detail only the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, which leads to a real
Hilbert space structure analogous to that of (classes of generally unbounded)
selfadjoint operators in Quantum Mechanics. For finite dimensions, general
dimensionality theorems that can be derived from a local observability
principle, allow us to represent the elements of the real Hilbert space as
operators over an underlying complex Hilbert space (see, however, a still open
problem at the end of the paper). The route for the present operational
axiomatization was suggested by novel ideas originated from Quantum Tomography.

state sigma (on all n qubits) whose reduced density matrices match
rho_1,...,rho_m.
  We prove the following result: if rho_1,...,rho_m are consistent with some

sigma' = (1/Z) exp(M_1+...+M_m), where each M_i is a Hermitian matrix acting on
the same qubits as rho_i, and Z is a normalizing factor. (This is known as a
Gibbs state.) Actually, we show a more general result, on the consistency of a
set of expectation values &lt;T_1&gt;,...,&lt;T_r&gt;, where the observables T_1,...,T_r
need not commute. This result was previously proved by Jaynes (1957) in the

maximal accessible information about the state. Another extremity is the
so-called `Scrooge' ensemble, which is mostly stingy to share the information.
We introduce `lazy' ensembles which require minimal efforts to prepare the
density matrix by selecting pure states with respect to completely random
choice.
  We consider two parties, Alice and Bob, playing a kind of game. Bob wishes to
guess which pure state is prepared by Alice. His null hypothesis, based on the
lack of any information about Alice's intention, is that Alice prepares any
pure state with equal probability. Then, the average quantum state measured by
Bob turns out to be $\rho$, and he has to make a new hypothesis about Alice's
intention solely based on the information that the observed density matrix is
$\rho$. The arising `lazy' ensemble is shown to be the alternative hypothesis
which minimizes the Type I error.

  classical communication</title><description>  We propose a communication-assisted local-hidden-variable model that yields
the correct outcome for the measurement of any product of Pauli operators on an
arbitrary graph state, i.e., that yields the correct global correlation among
the individual measurements in the Pauli product. Within this model,
communication is restricted to a single round of message passing between
adjacent nodes of the graph. We show that any model sharing some general
properties with our own is incapable, for at least some graph states, of
reproducing the expected correlations among all subsets of the individual
measurements. The ability to reproduce all such correlations is found to depend
on both the communication distance and the symmetries of the communication
protocol.

a given graph, is of both practical and theoretical importance to combinatorial
optimization, complexity theory and many other areas in theoretical computer
science. In this paper, we study the problem in the randomized and quantum
query models and give new lower and upper bound techniques in both models.
  The lower bound technique works for any graph that contains a product graph
as a subgraph. Applying it to the Boolean hypercube {0,1}^n and the constant
dimensional grids [n]^d, two particular product graphs that recently drew much
attention, we get the following tight results:
  RLS({0,1}^n) = \Theta(2^{n/2}n^{1/2}), QLS({0,1}^n) = \Theta(2^{n/3}n^{1/6}),
  RLS([n]^d) = \Theta(n^{d/2}) for d \geq 4, QLS([n]^d) = \Theta(n^{d/3}) for d
\geq 6.
  Here RLS(G) and QLS(G) are the randomized and quantum query complexities of
Local Search on G, respectively. These improve the previous results by Aaronson
[STOC'04], Ambainis (unpublished) and Santha and Szegedy [STOC'04].
  Our new algorithms work well when the underlying graph expands slowly. As an
application to [n]^2, a new quantum algorithm using O(\sqrt{n}(\log\log
n)^{1.5}) queries is given. This improves the previous best known upper bound
of O(n^{2/3}) (Aaronson, [STOC'04]), and implies that Local Search on grids
exhibits different properties in low dimensions.

spin qubits separated by centimeters. Qubits defined by the singlet and triplet
states of two exchange coupled quantum dots have recently been shown to possess
long coherence times. When the effective nuclear fields in the two asymmetric
quantum dots are different, total spin will no longer be a good quantum number
and there will be a large electric dipole coupling between the two qubit
states. We show that when such a double-quantum-dot qubit is embedded in a
superconducting microstrip cavity, the strong coupling regime of cavity quantum
electrodynamics lies within reach. Virtual photons in a common cavity mode
could mediate coherent interactions between two distant qubits embedded in the
same structure; the range of this two-qubit interaction is determined by the
wavelength of the microwave transition.

present generalization is that the formulation for higher dimensional systems
is invariant under permutation of the subsystems, hence is employed as a

Furthermore, the formulation for pure states can be conveniently extended to
the case of mixed states by utilizing the kronecker product approximate
technique. As applications, we give the analytic approximation of the criterion
for weakly mixed tripartite quantum states and consider the existence of
genuine tripartite entanglement of some weakly mixed states.

The measure is shown to be also obtained by the bipartite partitions of the
multipartite state. The distinct characteristic of the global entanglement is
that it consists of the sum of different entanglement contributions. The
measure can provide sufficient and necessary condition of fully separability
for pure states and be conveniently extended to mixed states by minimizing the
convex hull. To test the sufficiency of the measure for mixed states, we
evaluate the global entanglement of bound entangled states. The properties of
the measure discussed finally show the global entanglement is an entanglement

considered to be entirely associated with the ground-state. However, is there
an uncertainty associated with the time-separation variable between the proton

variable in the present form of quantum mechanics. The first step toward the
simultaneity problem is to study the role of this time-separation variable in
the Lorentz-covariant world. It is shown possible to study this problem using
harmonic oscillators applicable to hadrons which are bound states of quarks. It
is also possible to derive consequences that can be tested experimentally.

reduced Wigner function of an open quantum system at zero temperature. Our
model consists of a particle trapped in a cubic potential interacting with an
environment characterized by dissipative and normal and anomalous diffusion
coefficients. A representation based on the energy eigenfunctions of the
isolated system, i.e. the system uncoupled to the environment, is used to write
the reduced Wigner function, and the master equation becomes simpler in that
representation. The energy eigenfunctions computed in a WKB approximation
incorporate the tunneling effect of the isolated system and the effect of the
environment is described by an equation that it is in many ways similar to a
Fokker-Planck equation. Decoherence is easily identified from the master
equation and we find that when the decoherence time is much shorter than the
tunneling time the master equation can be approximated by a Kramers like
equation describing thermal activation due to the zero point fluctuations of
the quantum environment. The effect of anomalous diffusion can be dealt with
perturbatively and its overall effect is to inhibit tunneling.

Moreover, we estimate the maximal quantum violation of a correlation experiment

$R\_{\clubsuit} \equiv$ GF(2)[$x$]/$&lt;x^{3} - x&gt;$. The line is endowed with 18
points, spanning the neighbourhoods of three pairwise distant points. As
$R\_{\clubsuit}$ is not a local ring, the neighbour (or parallel) relation is
not an equivalence relation so that the sets of neighbour points to two distant
points overlap. There are nine neighbour points to any point of the line,
forming three disjoint families under the reduction modulo either of two
maximal ideals of the ring. Two of the families contain four points each and
they swap their roles when switching from one ideal to the other; the points of
the one family merge with (the image of) the point in question, while the
points of the other family go in pairs into the remaining two points of the
associated ordinary projective line of order two. The single point of the
remaining family is sent to the reference point under both the mappings and its
existence stems from a non-trivial character of the Jacobson radical, ${\cal
J}\_{\clubsuit}$, of the ring. The factor ring $\widetilde{R}\_{\clubsuit}
\equiv R\_{\clubsuit}/ {\cal J}\_{\clubsuit}$ is isomorphic to GF(2) $\otimes$
GF(2). The projective line over $\widetilde{R}\_{\clubsuit}$ features nine

remarkable ring geometries are surmised to be of relevance for modelling
entangled qubit states, to be discussed in detail in Part II of the paper.

of the quantum state of a qubit, proposed recently in Jacobs 2003 Phys. Rev.
A67 030301(R). The qubit starts in a completely mixed state, and information is
obtained by a continuous measurement. Jacobs' rapid purification protocol uses
Hamiltonian feedback control to maximise the average purity of the qubit for a
given time, with a factor of two increase in the purification rate over the
no-feedback protocol. However, by re-examining the latter approach, we show
that it mininises the average time taken for a qubit to reach a given purity.
In fact, the average time taken for the no-feedback protocol beats that for
Jacobs' protocol by a factor of two. We discuss how this is compatible with
Jacobs' result, and the usefulness of the different approaches.

may be resolved using a physical picture analogous to magnetic domains. Within
this picture, a quantum particle represents a coherent region of a quantum wave
with characteristic total energy, momentum, and spin. The dynamics of such a
state are described by the usual linear quantum wave equations. But the
coherence is maintained by a nonlinear self-interaction term that is evident
only during transitions from one quantum state to another. This is analogous to
the self-organizing property of domains in a ferromagnetic material, in which a
single domain may appear as a stable macro-particle, but with rapid transitions
between different domain configurations also possible. For the quantum case,
this implies that the &quot;collapse of the wave function&quot; is a real dynamical
physical process that occurs continuously in spacetime. This picture may also
permit the resolution of apparent paradoxes associated with quantum measurement
and entangled states.

physical intuition into generalized entanglement within a single system by
invoking the notion of extent of a state. The latter, in turn, is related to

QCMA-complete and PSPACE-complete problems which are based on braids. We

its most significant bit is PP-hard, circumventing the usual route through the

commutation relation. The corresponding nonzero minimal uncertainties in
position and momentum are determined and the effect on the energy spectrum and
eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator in an electric field is studied. The
second extension is a function-dependent generalization of the simplest
quadratic commutation relation with only a nonzero minimal uncertainty in

With each function-dependent commutation relation we associate a family of

quantum mechanical and shape invariance techniques. Some representations of the
generalized Heisenberg algebras are proposed in terms of conventional position

field is studied. We show that the spectrum of resonance fluorescence emitted
on the $\pi$ transitions shows a signature of spontaneously generated
interference effects. The degree of interference in the fluorescence spectrum
can be controlled by means of the external magnetic field, provided that the
Land\'e g-factors of the excited and the ground state doublet are different.
For a suitably chosen magnetic field strength, the relative weight of the
Rayleigh line can be completely suppressed, even for low intensities of the
coherent driving field. The incoherent fluorescence spectrum emitted on the
$\pi$ transitions exhibits a very narrow peak whose width and weight depends on
the magnetic field strength. We demonstrate that the spectrum of resonance

the $\sigma$ transitions allows to determine the branching ratio of the
spontaneous decay of each excited state into the $\sigma$ channel.

We first describe how to implement parallel single qudit operations. It is by
now well known that any single-qudit unitary can be decomposed into a sequence
of Givens rotations on two-dimensional subspaces of the qudit state space.
Using a coupling graph to represent physically allowed couplings between pairs
of qudit states, we then show that the logical depth of the parallel gate
sequence is equal to the height of an associated tree. The implementation of a
given unitary can then optimize the tradeoff between gate time and resources
used. These ideas are illustrated for qudits encoded in the ground hyperfine
states of the atomic alkalies $^{87}$Rb and $^{133}$Cs. Second, we provide a
protocol for implementing parallelized non-local two-qudit gates using the
assistance of entangled qubit pairs. Because the entangled qubits can be
prepared non-deterministically, this offers the possibility of high fidelity
two-qudit gates.

  Operations Using a Three-Dimensional Photonic Crystal Single-Mode Cavity</title><description>  We solve the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian with time-dependent coupling
parameters under dipole and rotating-wave approximation for a three-dimensional
(3D) photonic crystal (PC) single mode cavity with a sufficiently high quality

a dual-rail Hadamard gate, a dual-rail NOT gate, and a SWAP gate. The atoms in

Cummings model of two modes bosons interacting with two spins. The lower
excitation states of this model are calculated to reveal the underlying physics
of the far infrared absorption spectra. The analytic perturbation approach
shows that an effective transverse coupling of spins can be obtained by
eliminating the orbital degrees of freedom in the large detuning limit. Here,
the orbital degrees of freedom of the two electrons, which are described by two
modes of bosons, serve as a quantized data bus to exchange the quantum
information between two electrons. Then a nontrivial two-qubit logic gate is
realized and spin entanglement between the two electrons is created by virtue
of spin-orbit coupling.

temperature, by deriving a set of variational equations of the free energy
after the particle-number projection. With its broad applicability, this theory
can be a useful tool for investigating the pairing phase transition in finite
systems with the particle-number conservation. This theory provides effects of
the symmetry-restoring fluctuation (SRF) for the pairing phenomena in finite
fermionic systems, distinctively from those of additional quantum fluctuations.
It is shown by numerical calculations that the phase transition is compatible
with the conservation in this theory, and that the SRF shifts up the critical
temperature ($T^\mathrm{cr}$). This shift of $T^\mathrm{cr}$ occurs due to
reduction of degrees-of-freedom in canonical ensembles, and decreases only
slowly as the particle-number increases (or as the level spacing narrows), in
contrast to the conventional BCS theory.

even exponentially fewer, qubits than possible classically. Moreover, some of
these methods have a very simple structure--they involve only few message
exchanges between the communicating parties. It is therefore natural to ask
whether every classical protocol may be transformed to a ``simpler'' quantum
protocol--one that has similar efficiency, but uses fewer message exchanges.
  We show that for any constant k, there is a problem such that its k+1 message
classical communication complexity is exponentially smaller than its k message
quantum communication complexity. This, in particular, proves a round hierarchy
theorem for quantum communication complexity, and implies, via a simple
reduction, an Omega(N^{1/k}) lower bound for k message quantum protocols for
Set Disjointness for constant k.
  Enroute, we prove information-theoretic lemmas, and define a related measure
of correlation, the informational distance, that we believe may be of
significance in other contexts as well.

schemes have been studied, via the algebraic combinatorics structures of
association schemes, namely semi-simple modules of their Bose-Mesner and
(reference state dependent) Terwilliger algebras. By choosing the (walk)
starting site as a reference state, the Terwilliger algebra connected with this
choice turns the graph into the metric space, hence stratifies the graph into a
(d+1) disjoint union of strata, where the amplitudes of observing the
continuous-time quantum walk on all sites belonging to a given stratum are the
same. In graphs of association schemes with known spectrum, the transition
amplitudes and average probabilities are given in terms of dual eigenvalues of
association schemes. As most of association schemes arise from finite groups,
hence the continuous-time walk on generic group association schemes have been
studied in great details, where the transition amplitudes are given in terms of
characters of groups. Further investigated examples are the walk on graphs of
association schemes of symmetric $S_n$, Dihedral $D_{2m}$ and cyclic groups.
Also, following Ref.\cite{js}, the spectral distributions connected to the
highest irreducible representations of Terwilliger algebras of some rather
important graphs, namely distance regular graphs, have been presented. Then
using spectral distribution, the amplitudes of continuous-time quantum walk on
graphs such as cycle graph $C_n$, Johnson and normal subgroup graphs have been
evaluated. {\bf Keywords: Continuous-time quantum walk, Association scheme,

positive transformations. In particular, we show that arbitrary mapping
$\varrho_{\rm in}\to\varrho_{\rm out}$ can be realized by using appropriate set
of preparators and applying the unitary operation SWAP. The experimental
``realization'' of perfect NOT operation is presented. We address the problem
of the verification of the compatibility of the preparator devices with the
estimating process. The evolution map describing the dynamics in arbitrary time
interval is known not to be completely positive, but still linear. The
tomography and general properties of these maps are discussed.

energy-momentum tensor are investigated for a massive scalar field with general
curvature coupling parameter in the region between two coaxial cylindrical
boundaries. It is assumed that the field obeys general Robin boundary
conditions on bounding surfaces. The application of a variant of the
generalized Abel-Plana formula allows to extract from the expectation values
the contribution from single shells and to present the interference part in
terms of exponentially convergent integrals. The vacuum forces acting on the
boundaries are presented as the sum of self-action and interaction terms. The
first one contains well-known surface divergences and needs a further
renormalization. The interaction forces between the cylindrical boundaries are
finite and are attractive for special cases of Dirichlet and Neumann scalars.
For the general Robin case the interaction forces can be both attractive or
repulsive depending on the coefficients in the boundary conditions. The total
Casimir energy is evaluated by using the zeta function regularization
technique. It is shown that it contains a part which is located on bounding
surfaces. The formula for the interference part of the surface energy is
derived and the energy balance is discussed.

(standard) quantum logic (QL). Within the orthodox interpretation of QM the
propositions of QL cannot be associated with sentences of a language stating
properties of individual samples of a physical system, since properties are
nonobjective in QM. This makes the interpretation of propositions
problematical. The difficulty can be removed by adopting the objective
interpretation of QM proposed by one of the authors (semantic realism, or SR,
interpretation). In this case, a unified perspective can be adopted for QM and
classical mechanics (CM), and a simple first order predicate calculus L(x) with
Tarskian semantics can be constructed such that one can associate a physical
proposition (i.e., a set of physical states) with every sentence of L(x). The
set $P^{f}$ of all physical propositions is partially ordered and contains a
subset $P^{f}_{T}$ of testable physical propositions whose order structure
depends on the criteria of testability established by the physical theory. In
particular, $P^{f}_{T}$ turns out to be a Boolean lattice in CM, while it can
be identified with QL in QM. Hence the propositions of QL can be associated
with sentences of L(x), or also with the sentences of a suitable quantum
language $L_{TQ}(x)$, and the structure of QL characterizes the notion of
testability in QM. One can then show that the notion of quantum truth does not
conflict with the classical notion of truth within this perspective.
Furthermore, the interpretation of QL propounded here proves to be equivalent
to a previous pragmatic interpretation worked out by one of the authors, and
can be embodied within a more general perspective which considers states as
first order predicates of a broader language with a Kripkean semantics.

simulate, with exponential overhead, classical shared-randomness SMP protocols
by means of quantum SMP protocols without shared randomness
($Q^\parallel$-protocols). Our first result is to extend Yao's simulation to
the strongest possible model: every many-round quantum protocol with unlimited
shared entanglement can be simulated, with exponential overhead, by
$Q^\parallel$-protocols. We apply our technique to obtain an efficient
$Q^\parallel$-protocol for a function which cannot be efficiently solved
through more restricted simulations. Second, we tightly characterize the power
of the quantum fingerprinting technique by making a connection to arrangements
of homogeneous halfspaces with maximal margin. These arrangements have been
well studied in computational learning theory, and we use some strong results
obtained in this area to exhibit weaknesses of quantum fingerprinting. In
particular, this implies that for almost all functions, quantum fingerprinting
protocols are exponentially worse than classical deterministic SMP protocols.

frequencies where the light field extracts kinetic energy from the atomic
motion, the dynamics combines optical lasing and motional cooling. From the
corresponding momentum diffusion coefficient we predict sub-Doppler
temperatures in the stationary state. This generalizes the theory of cavity
enhanced laser cooling to active cavity systems. We identify the gain induced
reduction of the effective resonator linewidth as key origin for the faster
cooling and lower temperatures, which implys that a bad cavity with a gain
medium can replace a high-Q cavity. In addition, this shows the importance of
light forces for gas lasers in the low-temperature limit, where atoms can
arrange in a periodic pattern maximizing gain and counteracting spatial hole
burning. Ultimately, in the low temperature limit, such a setup should allow to
combine optical lasing and atom lasing in single device.

flux N and hence can be significantly squeezed only over a limited frequency

(N/kappa)^{-1/2} scaling found previously for coherent beams. In the
experimentally realistic case where there is a limit on the maximum squeezing
possible, the variance will be reduced below that for coherent beams, though

this entanglement essentially depends on the atomic positions (asymmetrical

it can be extended in time if the detuning is large enough. We study

resource, researchers have sought efficient ways to tell whether a given
density matrix represents an unentangled, or separable, state. This paper gives
the first systematic and comprehensive treatment of this (bipartite) quantum
separability problem, focusing on its deterministic (as opposed to randomized)
computational complexity. First, I review the one-sided tests for separability,
paying particular attention to the semidefinite programming methods. Then, I
discuss various ways of formulating the quantum separability problem, from
exact to approximate formulations, the latter of which are the paper's main
focus. I then give a thorough treatment of the problem's relationship with the
complexity classes NP, NP-complete, and co-NP. I also discuss extensions of
Gurvits' NP-hardness result to strong NP-hardness of certain related problems.
A major open question is whether the NP-contained formulation (QSEP) of the
quantum separability problem is Karp-NP-complete; QSEP may be the first natural
example of a problem that is Turing-NP-complete but not Karp-NP-complete.
Finally, I survey all the proposed (deterministic) algorithms for the quantum
separability problem, including the bounded search for symmetric extensions
(via semidefinite programming), based on the recent quantum de Finetti theorem;
and the entanglement-witness search (via interior-point algorithms and global
optimization). These two algorithms have the lowest complexity, with the latter
being the best under advice of asymptotically optimal point-coverings of the
sphere.

devices (RD), i.e., dynamical systems that are very sensitive to the
environment. We show that, in the presence of RDs, the usual arguments based on
the linearity of quantum mechanics that lead to the measurement problem do not
apply. RDs are the source of probabilities in quantum mechanics. Hence, the
reason for probabilities in quantum mechanics is the same as the reason for
probabilities in other parts of physics, namely our ignorance of the state of
the environment. This should not be confused with decoherence. The environment
here plays several, equally important roles: it is the dump for energy and
entropy of the RD, it puts the RD close to its transition point and it is the
reason for probabilities in quantum mechanics. We show that, even though the
state of the environment is unknown, the probabilities can be calculated and
are given by the Born rule. We then discuss what this view of quantum mechanics
means for the search of a quantum theory of gravity.

with absorbing/scattering walls is presented. The theory covers recent
experiments in which the ultracold neutrons were beamed between a mirror and a
rough scatterer/absorber. The analysis is based on a recently developed theory
of quantum transport along random rough walls which is modified in order to
include leaky (absorbing) interfaces and, more importantly, the low-amplitude
high-aperture roughness. The calculations are focused on a regime when the
direct transitions into the continuous spectrum above the absorption threshold
dominate the depletion of neutrons from the gravitational states and are more
efficient than the processes involving the intermediate states. The theoretical
results for the neutron count are sensitive to the correlation radius (lateral
size) of surface inhomogeneities and to the ratio of the particle energy to the
absorption threshold in a weak roughness limit. The main impediment for
observation of the higher gravitational states is the &quot;overhang&quot; of the
particle wave functions which can be overcome only by use scatterers with
strong roughness. In general, the strong roughness with high amplitude is
preferable if one wants just to detect the individual gravitational states,
while the strong roughness experiments with small amplitude and high aperture
are preferable for the quantitative analysis of the data. We also discuss the
ways to further improve the accuracy of calculations and to optimize the
experimental regime.

simple proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker (BKS) theorem in Hilbert spaces of
dimensions four and eight by making use of what has since been referred to as
the Mermin(-Peres) &quot;magic square&quot; and the Mermin pentagram, respectively. The
former is a $3 \times 3$ array of nine observables commuting pairwise in each
row and column and arranged so that their product properties contradict those
of the assigned eigenvalues. The latter is a set of ten observables arranged in
five groups of four lying along five edges of the pentagram and characterized
by similar contradiction. An interesting one-to-one correspondence between the
operators of the Mermin-Peres square and the points of the projective line over
the product ring ${\rm GF}(2) \otimes \rm{GF}(2)$ is established. Under this
mapping, the concept &quot;mutually commuting&quot; translates into &quot;mutually distant&quot;
and the distinguishing character of the third column's observables has its
counterpart in the distinguished properties of the coordinates of the
corresponding points, whose entries are both either zero-divisors, or units.
The ten operators of the Mermin pentagram answer to a specific subset of points
of the line over GF(2)[$x$]/$&lt;x^{3} - x&gt;$. The situation here is, however, more
intricate as there are two different configurations that seem to serve equally
well our purpose. The first one comprises the three distinguished points of the
(sub)line over GF(2), their three &quot;Jacobson&quot; counterparts and the four points
whose both coordinates are zero-divisors; the other features the neighbourhood
of the point ($1, 0$) (or, equivalently, that of ($0, 1$)). Some other ring
lines that might be relevant for BKS proofs in higher dimensions are also
mentioned.

that the stacking interaction is entirely attributed to primary qubits in each
map, if each subsystem has power-of-two Hilbert space dimension. We here study
the particular example of two baker maps that interact via a controlled-not

electromagnetically induced transparency have very interesting properties, such

are quasiparticles, the so-called dark polaritons, which are mixtures of a
photonic and an atomic contribution. We here demonstrate that these excitations
behave as particles with a nonzero magnetic moment, which is in clear contrast
to the properties of a free photon. It is found that light passing through a
rubidium gas cell under the conditions of electromagnetically induced
transparency is deflected by a small magnetic field gradient. The deflection
angle is proportional to the optical propagation time through the cell. The
observed beam deflection can be understood by assuming that dark state
polaritons have an effective magnetic moment. Our experiment can be described

monopole spacetime and boundary conditions imposed on this field. Specifically
we investigate the vacuum expectation values of the energy-momentum tensor and
fermionic condensate admitting that the field obeys the MIT bag boundary
condition on two concentric spherical shells. In order to develop this
analysis, we use the generalized Abel-Plana summation, which allows to extract
from the vacuum expectation values the contribution coming from a single sphere
geometry and to present the second sphere induced part in terms of
exponentially convergent integrals. In the limit of strong gravitational field
corresponding to small values of the parameter describing the solid angle
deficit in global monopole geometry, the interference part in the expectation
values are exponentially suppressed. The vacuum forces acting on spheres are
presented as the sum of self-action and interaction terms. Due to the surface
divergences, the first one is divergent and needs additional renormalization,
while the second one is finite for all non-zero distances between the spheres.
By making use of zeta function renormalization technique, the total Casimir
energy is evaluated in the region between two spheres. It is shown that the
interaction part of the vacuum energy is negative and the interaction forces
between the spheres are attractive. Asymptotic expressions are derived in
various limiting cases. As a special case we discuss the fermionic vacuum
densities for two spherical shells on background of the Minkowski spacetime.

ensemble of spin chains with dipole-dipole interaction between the spins. The
unwanted effect of the long-range dipole interaction is compensated by the
optimal choice of the parameters of radio-frequency pulses implementing the
protocol. The errors caused by (i) the influence of the environment,(ii)
non-selective excitations, (iii) influence of different spin chains on each
other, (iv) displacements of qubits from their perfect locations, and (v)
fluctuations of the external magnetic field are estimated analytically and
calculated numerically. For the perfectly entangled state the z component, M,
of the magnetization of the whole system is equal to zero. The errors lead to a
finite value of M. If the number of qubits in the system is large, M can be
detected experimentally. Using the fact that M depends differently on the
parameters of the system for each kind of error, varying these parameters would
allow one to experimentally determine the most significant source of errors and
to optimize correspondingly the quantum computer design in order to decrease
the errors and M. Using our approach one can benchmark the quantum computer,

transfer of quantum state information. In this paper, we investigate the
efficiency of such quantum spin channels which work in a decoherence
environment. Our results show that, the decoherence will significantly reduce
the fidelity of quantum communication through the spin channels. Generally

analyzed. Each particle in the box behaves like an independent entity
represented by a {\it macro-orbital} (a kind of pair waveform). While the
expectation value of their interaction, $&lt;V_{HC}(x)&gt;$, vanishes for every state
of two particles, the expectation value of their relative separation, $&lt;x&gt;$,
satisfies $&lt;x&gt; \ge \lambda/2$ (or $q \ge \pi/d$, with $2d = L$ being the size
of the box). The particles in their ground state define a close-packed
arrangement of their wave packets (with $&lt;x&gt; = \lambda/2$, phase position
separation $\Delta\phi = 2\pi$ and momentum $|q_o| = \pi/d$) and experience a
mutual repulsive force ({\it zero point repulsion}) $f_o = h^2/2md^3$ which
also tries to expand the box. While the relative dynamics of two particles in
their excited states represents usual collisional motion, the same in their
ground state becomes collisionless. These results have great significance in

the transition frequency between two different topological coherent modes, each

that it is protected from a given set of error operators. Both involve encoding
information by means of subsystems. One is initialization-based error
protection, which involves a quantum operation that is applied before error
events occur. The other is operator quantum error correction, which uses a
recovery operation applied after the errors. Together, the two approaches make
it clear how quantum information can be stored at all stages of a process
involving alternating error and quantum operations. In particular, there is
always a subsystem that faithfully represents the desired quantum information.
We give a definition of faithful realization of quantum information and show
that it always involves subsystems. This justifies the &quot;subsystems principle&quot;
for realizing quantum information. In the presence of errors, one can make use
of noiseless, (initialization) protectable, or error-correcting subsystems. We
give an explicit algorithm for finding optimal noiseless subsystems. Finding
optimal protectable or error-correcting subsystems is in general difficult.
Verifying that a subsystem is error-correcting involves only linear algebra. We
discuss the verification problem for protectable subsystems and reduce it to a
simpler version of the problem of finding error-detecting codes.

textbooks used to teach Quantum Mechanics, that it is a difficult task to apply
the time evolution operator Exp{-itH/h} on an initial wave function. That is to
say, because the hamiltonian operator generally is the sum of two operators,
then it is a difficult task to apply the time evolution operator on an initial
wave function f(x,0), for it implies to apply terms operators like (a+b)^n. A
possible solution of this problem is to factorize the time evolution operator
and then apply successively the individual exponential operator on the initial
wave function. However, the exponential operator does not directly factorize,
i. e. Exp{a+b} is not equal to Exp{a}Exp{b}. In this work we present a useful
procedure for factorizing the time evolution operator when the argument of the
exponential is a sum of two operators, which obey specific commutation
relations. Then, we apply the exponential operator as an evolution operator for
the case of elementary unidimensional potentials, like the particle subject to
a constant force and the harmonic oscillator. Also, we argue about an apparent
paradox concerning the time evolution operator and non-spreading wave packets
addressed previously in the literature.

the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over Z_2^n provided one of the first
algebraic problems for which quantum computers are exponentially faster than
their classical counterparts. In this paper, we study the generalization of
Simon's problem to arbitrary groups. Fixing a finite group G, this is the
problem of recovering an involution m = (m_1, ..., m_n) in G^n from an oracle f
with the property that f(x) = f(xy) iff y equals m or the identity. In the
current parlance, this is the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over groups of the
form G^n, where G is a nonabelian group of constant size, and where the hidden
subgroup is either trivial or has order two. Although groups of the form G^n
have a simple product structure, they share important representation-theoretic
properties with the symmetric groups S_n, where a solution to the HSP would
yield a quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism. In particular, solving their
HSP with the so-called ``standard method'' requires highly entangled
measurements on the tensor product of many coset states. Here we give quantum
algorithms with time complexity 2^O(sqrt(n log n)) that recover hidden
involutions m = (m_1, ..., m_n) in G^n where, as in Simon's problem, each m_i
is either the identity or the conjugate of a known element k, and there is a
character X of G for which X(k) = -X(1)$. Our approach combines the general
idea behind Kuperberg's sieve for dihedral groups with the ``missing harmonic''
approach of Moore and Russell. These are the first nontrivial hidden subgroup
algorithms for group families that require highly entangled multiregister
Fourier sampling.

symmetry, and a time-reversal symmetry. We show that, even when these features
are taken into account, the asymptotic entangling power of the baker's map does
not always agree with the predictions of random matrix theory. We have verified
that the dimension of the Hilbert space is the crucial parameter which
determines whether the entangling properties of the baker are universal or not.
For power-of-two dimensions, i.e., qubit systems, an anomalous entangling power
is observed; otherwise the behavior of the baker is consistent with random
matrix theories. We also derive a general formula that relates the asymptotic
entangling power of an arbitrary unitary with properties of its reduced

This effect arises from the intrinsic performance difference between quantum

  Complete transfer of the quantum state of the incident photon to a collective

information between a random variable encoded into quantum states, and the
probabilistic outcome of a quantum measurement of the encoding. Accessible
information is extremely difficult to characterize analytically; even bounds on
it are hard to place. The celebrated Holevo bound states that accessible
information cannot exceed chi(E), the quantum mutual information between the
random variable and its encoding. However, for general ensembles, the gap
between the acc(E) and chi(E) may be arbitrarily large.
  We consider the special case of a binary random variable, which often serves
as a stepping stone towards other results in information theory and
communication complexity. We give explicit lower bounds on the the accessible
information acc(E) of an ensemble E = {(p, rho_0), (1-p, rho_1)}, with 0 &lt;= p
&lt;= 1, as functions of p and chi(E). The bounds are incomparable in the sense
that they surpass each other in different parameter regimes.
  Our bounds arise by measuring the ensemble according to a complete orthogonal
measurement that preserves the fidelity of the states rho_0,rho_1. As an
intermediate step, therefore, we give new relations between the two quantities
acc(E), chi(E) and the fidelity B(rho_0,rho_1).

the role of the distance from the detector to the initial location of the

close and strong detector, the decay rate of the system is reduced; weaker
detectors do not modify the exponential decay rate but suppress the long-time

of measurement disappear by increasing the distance between the initial state

mechanics, an explanation must be found of the fact that the Hamiltonian, which
is defined to be the operator that generates evolution in time, is bounded from
below. The mechanism that can produce exactly such a constraint is identified
in this paper. It is the fact that not all classical data are registered in the
quantum description. Large sets of values of these data are assumed to be
indistinguishable, forming equivalence classes. It is argued that this should
be attributed to information loss, such as what one might suspect to happen
during the formation and annihilation of virtual black holes.
  The nature of the equivalence classes is further elucidated, as it follows
from the positivity of the Hamiltonian. Our world is assumed to consist of a
very large number of subsystems that may be regarded as approximately
independent, or weakly interacting with one another. As long as two (or more)
sectors of our world are treated as being independent, they all must be
demanded to be restricted to positive energy states only. What follows from
these considerations is a unique definition of energy in the quantum system in
terms of the periodicity of the limit cycles of the deterministic model.

can be quantified either by computing pairwise concurrence or by dividing the
chain into two complementary subsystems. In the latter case the smaller
subsystem is usually a single spin or a block of adjacent spins and the
entanglement differentiates between critical and non-critical regimes. Here we
extend this approach by considering a more general setting: our smaller
subsystem $S_A$ consists of a {\it comb} of $L$ spins, spaced $p$ sites apart.
Our results are thus not restricted to a simple `area law', but contain
non-local information, parameterized by the spacing $p$. For the XX model we
calculate the von-Neumann entropy analytically when $N\to \infty$ and
investigate its dependence on $L$ and $p$. We find that an external magnetic
field induces an unexpected length scale for entanglement in this case.

two-level atoms, interacting with a common environment. Our investigation of
entanglement dynamics reflects that the environment has dual actions on the
entanglement of the qubits in the model. While the environment destroys the
entanglement induced by the coherent dipole-dipole interactions, it can produce
stable entanglement between the qubits prepared initially in a separable state.
The analysis shows that it is the entangled decoherence-free states contained
as components in the initial state that contribute to the stable entanglement.
Our study indicates how the environmental noise produces the entanglement and
exposes the interplay of environmental noise and coherent interactions of

  Open Quasi-Classical Nonlinear Mesoscopic Systems</title><description>  We review our results on a mathematical dynamical theory for observables for
open many-body quantum nonlinear bosonic systems for a very general class of
Hamiltonians. We show that non-quadratic (nonlinear) terms in a Hamiltonian
provide a singular &quot;quantum&quot; perturbation for observables in some &quot;mesoscopic&quot;
region of parameters. In particular, quantum effects result in secular terms in
the dynamical evolution, that grow in time. We argue that even for open quantum
nonlinear systems in the deep quasi-classical region, these quantum effects can
survive after decoherence and relaxation processes take place. We demonstrate
that these quantum effects in open quantum systems can be observed, for
example, in the frequency Fourier spectrum of the dynamical observables, or in
the corresponding spectral density of noise. Estimates are presented for
Bose-Einstein condensates, low temperature mechanical resonators, and nonlinear
optical systems prepared in large amplitude coherent states. In particular, we
show that for Bose-Einstein condensate systems the characteristic time of
deviation of quantum dynamics for observables from the corresponding classical
dynamics coincides with the characteristic time-scale of the well-known quantum
nonlinear effect of phase diffusion.

development has been mainly due to the experimental and theoretical advantages
offered by CV systems, i.e., quantum systems described by a set of observables,
like position and momentum, which have a continuous spectrum of eigenvalues.
According to this novel trend, quantum information protocols like quantum
teleportation have been suitably extended to the CV framework. Here, we briefly
review some mathematical tools relative to CV systems and we consequently
develop the concepts of quantum entanglement and teleportation in the CV
framework, by analogy with the qubit-based approach. Some connections between
teleportation fidelity and entanglement properties of the underlying quantum
channel are inspected. Next, we face the study of CV quantum teleportation
networks where more users share a multipartite state and an arbitrary pair of
them performs quantum teleportation. In this context, we show alternative

continuations of each other. Classical phase transitions are characterized by
non-analyticities of the free energy. For quantum phase transitions (QPTs) the
ground state energy often assumes the role of the free energy. But in a number
of important cases this criterion fails to predict a QPT, such as the
three-dimensional metal-insulator transition of non-interacting electrons in a
random potential (Anderson localization). It is therefore essential that we
find alternative criteria that can track fundamental changes in the internal
correlations of the ground state wavefunction. Here we propose that QPTs are
generally accompanied by non-analyticities of the von Neumann (entanglement)
entropy. In particular, the entropy is non-analytic at the Anderson transition,
where it exhibits unusual fractal scaling. We also examine two dissipative
quantum systems of considerable interest to the study of decoherence and find
that non-analyticities occur if and only if the system undergoes a QPT.

spin-orbit coupling shows how spin decoherence and dephasing lead to
substantial enhancement of charge current fluctuations (characterized by Fano
factors $&gt; 1/3$). However, these processes and the corresponding shot noise
increase are suppressed in narrow wires, so that charge transport experiments
measuring the Fano factor $F_{\uparrow \to \uparrow \downarrow}$ in a
ferromagnet/SO-coupled-wire/paramagnet setup also quantify the degree of
phase-coherence of transported spin--we predict a one-to-one correspondence
between the magnitude of the spin polarization vector and $F_{\uparrow \to
\uparrow \downarrow}$.

  2000 protocol</title><description>  This paper presents the security analysis on the quantum stream cipher so
called Yuen-2000 protocol (or $\alpha\eta$ scheme) against the fast correlation
attack, the typical attack on stream ciphers. Although a very simple
experimental model of the quantum stream cipher without a random mapper may be
decrypted in the information theoretic sense by the fast correlation algorithm,
it is not a basic feature of Yuen 2000 protocol. In fact, we clarify that there
exists a randomization scheme which attains the perfect correlation immunity
against such attacks under an approximation. And in this scheme, the running
key correlation from the second randomization that determines the mapping
patterns is dismissed also by quantum noise. In such a case, any fast
correlation attack does not work on the quantum stream cipher.

The results once again underline that entanglement is not a necessary feature

through a resistance, we consider a device in a superconducting loop. This

criterion, we derive equations for the maximum pumped current and optimize the
sluice accordingly. These results apply also to the high accuracy pumping which
results in a potential candidate for a metrological current standard. For
measuring the pumped current, an additional Josephson junction is installed
into the superconducting loop. We show in detail that the switching of this

The experimental realization of our scheme would be the first observation of

entanglement in the context of Communication Complexity, our understanding of
the latter is not as good as of the former. In particular, there is no known
&quot;entanglement analogue&quot; for the famous theorem by Newman, saying that the
number of shared random bits required for solving any communication problem can
be at most logarithmic in the input length (i.e., using more than O(log n)
shared random bits would not reduce the complexity of an optimal solution).
  In this paper we prove that the same is not true for entanglement. We
establish a wide range of tight (up to a polylogarithmic factor) entanglement
vs. communication tradeoffs for relational problems. The low end is: for any
t&gt;2, reducing shared entanglement from log^t(n) to o(log^{t-2}(n)) qubits can
increase the communication required for solving a problem almost exponentially,
from O(log^t(n)) to \Omega(\sqrt n). The high end is: for any \eps&gt;0, reducing
shared entanglement from n^{1-\eps}log(n) to o(n^{1-\eps}/log(n)) can increase
the required communication from O(n^{1-\eps}log(n)) to
\Omega(n^{1-\eps/2}/log(n)). The upper bounds are demonstrated via protocols
which are exact and work in the \e{simultaneous message passing model}, while
the lower bounds hold for \e{bounded-error protocols}, even in the more
powerful \e{model of 1-way communication}. Our protocols use shared EPR pairs
while the lower bounds apply to any sort of prior entanglement.
  We base the lower bounds on a strong direct product theorem for communication
complexity of a certain class of relational problems. We believe that the
theorem might have applications outside the scope of this work.

proofs, or in complexity terms, whether QMA=QCMA. We prove three results about
this question. First, we give a &quot;quantum oracle separation&quot; between QMA and
QCMA. More concretely, we show that any quantum algorithm needs order
sqrt(2^n/(m+1)) queries to find an n-qubit &quot;marked state&quot; |psi&gt;, even if given
an m-bit classical description of |psi&gt; together with a quantum black box that
recognizes |psi&gt;. Second, we give an explicit QCMA protocol that nearly
achieves this lower bound. Third, we show that, in the one previously-known
case where quantum proofs seemed to provide an exponential advantage, classical
proofs are basically just as powerful. In particular, Watrous gave a QMA
protocol for verifying non-membership in finite groups. Under plausible
group-theoretic assumptions, we give a QCMA protocol for the same problem. Even
with no assumptions, our protocol makes only polynomially many queries to the
group oracle. We end with some conjectures about quantum versus classical
oracles, and about the possibility of a classical oracle separation between QMA
and QCMA.

  Parallelism in Quantum Computing</title><description>  The assumption of maximum parallelism support for the successful realization
of scalable quantum computers has led to homogeneous, ``sea-of-qubits''
architectures. The resulting architectures overcome the primary challenges of
reliability and scalability at the cost of physically unacceptable system area.
We find that by exploiting the natural serialization at both the application
and the physical microarchitecture level of a quantum computer, we can reduce
the area requirement while improving performance. In particular we present a
scalable quantum architecture design that employs specialization of the system
into memory and computational regions, each individually optimized to match
hardware support to the available parallelism. Through careful application and
system analysis, we find that our new architecture can yield up to a factor of
thirteen savings in area due to specialization. In addition, by providing a
memory hierarchy design for quantum computers, we can increase time performance
by a factor of eight. This result brings us closer to the realization of a
quantum processor that can solve meaningful problems.

In this paper, we show that if the initial hamiltonian of a quantum adiabatic
evolution with a interpolation path is too simple, the minimal gap between the

an inverse exponential distance. Thus quantum adiabatic evolutions of this kind
can't be used to design efficient quantum algorithms. Similarly, we show that a

by any quantum adiabatic evolution with a interpolation path.

fundamentally different from the case of scalar particles. Intrinsic properties
of fermions (exclusion principle and spin) affect strongly the interaction of
fermions with both Hawking radiation and metric of the spacetime. In particular
we have found the following: first, while the fermion vacuum state seen by the
Rindler observer is an entangled state in which the right and left Rindler
wedge states appear in correlated pairs as in the case of the scalar particles,
the entanglement disappears in the excited state due to the exclusion
principle; second, the spin of the fermion experiences the Winger rotation
under a uniform acceleration; and third, the quantum information of fermions
encoded in spin (entangled state is composed of different spin states but with
the same mode function) is dissipated not by the Hawking radiation but by the
Wigner rotation as the pair approaches the event horizon.

degree of coherence in the system is intertwined with the asymptotic difference
in level populations; (c) the traditional population-relaxation and decoherence

the possibility of nonlinear self--phase modulation on the wavefunction during

These exhibit a variety of dynamical behaviors, including ballistic motion,

sequential machines (SSMs). Recently, we showed that two QSMs M_1 and M_2 with
n_1 and n_2 states, respectively, are equivalent iff they are
(n_1+n_2)^2--equivalent (Theoretical Computer Science 358 (2006) 65-74).
However, using this result to check the equivalence likely needs exponential
expected time. In this paper, we consider the time complexity of deciding the
equivalence between QSMs and related problems. The main results are as follows:
(1) We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the equivalence between
QSMs, and, if two QSMs are not equivalent, this algorithm will produce an
input-output pair with length not more than (n_1+n_2)^2. (2) We improve the
bound for the equivalence between QSMs from (n_1+n_2)^2 to n_1^2+n_2^2-1, by
employing Moore and Crutchfield's method (Theoretical Computer Science
 237 (2000) 275-306). (3) We give that two MO-1QFAs with n_1 and n_2 states,
respectively, are equivalent iff they are (n_1+n_2)^2--equivalent, and further
obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the equivalence between two
MO-1QFAs. (4) We provide a counterexample showing that Koshiba's method to
solve the problem of deciding the equivalence between MM-1QFAs may be not
valid, and thus the problem is left open again.

with photons whose wave function propagates in a one-dimensional Kerr-nonlinear
photonic crystal. The photonic crystal causes the incident photons to undergo
Bragg reflection by its periodic structure of dielectric materials and forms
the photonic band structure, namely, the light dispersion relation. This
dispersion relation reduces the group velocity of the wave function of the
photons, so that it enhances nonlinear interaction of the photons. (Because
variation of the group velocity against the wave vector is very steep, we have
to tune up the wavelength of injected photons precisely, however.) If the
photonic crystal includes layers of a Kerr medium, we can rotate the phase of
the wave function of the incident photons by a large angle efficiently. We show
that we can construct the nonlinear sign-shift (NS) gate proposed by Knill,
Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) by this method. Thus, we can construct the
conditional sign-flip gate for two qubits, which is crucial for quantum
computation. Our NS gate works with probability unity in principle while KLM's
original one is a nondeterministic gate conditioned on the detection of an
auxiliary photon.

defined over the direct product ring $R\_{\triangle} \equiv$
GF(2)$\otimesGF(2)\otimes$GF(2). The ring is remarkable in that except for
unity, all the remaining seven elements are zero-divisors, the non-trivial ones
forming two distinct sets of three; elementary ('slim') and composite ('fat').
Due to this fact, the line in question is endowed with a very intricate
structure. It contains twenty-seven points, every point has eighteen neighbour
points, the neighbourhoods of two distant points share twelve points and those
of three pairwise distant points have six points in common -- namely those with
coordinates having both the entries `fat' zero-divisors. Algebraically, the
points of the line can be partitioned into three groups: a) the group
comprising three distinguished points of the ordinary projective line of order
two (the 'nucleus'), b) the group composed of twelve points whose coordinates
feature both the unit(y) and a zero-divisor (the 'inner shell') and c) the
group of twelve points whose coordinates have both the entries zero-divisors
(the 'outer shell'). The points of the last two groups can further be split
into two subgroups of six points each; while in the former case there is a
perfect symmetry between the two subsets, in the latter case the subgroups have
a different footing, reflecting the existence of the two kinds of a
zero-divisor. The structure of the two shells, the way how they are
interconnected and their link with the nucleus are all fully revealed and
illustrated in terms of the neighbour/distant relation. Possible applications
of this finite ring geometry are also mentioned.

consciousness, in contrast to earlier suggestions that consciousness might be
understood starting from quantum theory. The notion of streams of
consciousness, usually restricted to conscious beings, is extended to the
notion of a Universal/Global stream of conscious flow of ordered events. The
streams of conscious events which we experience constitute sub-streams of the
Universal stream. Our postulated ontological character of consciousness also
consists of an operator which acts on a state of potential consciousness to
create or modify the likelihoods for later events to occur and become part of
the Universal conscious flow. A generalized process of measurement-perception
is introduced, where the operation of consciousness brings into existence, from
a state of potentiality, the event in consciousness. This is mathematically
represented by (a) an operator acting on the state of potential-consciousness
before an actual event arises in consciousness and (b) the reflecting of the
result of this operation back onto the state of potential-consciousness for
comparison in order for the event to arise in consciousness. Beginning from our
postulated ontology that consciousness is primary and from the most elementary
conscious contents, such as perception of periodic change and motion, quantum
theory follows naturally as the description of the conscious experience.

To compute Holevo capacity, Voronoi diagrams in the Bloch ball with respect to
the quantum divergence have been used as a powerful tool. These diagrams
basically treat mixed quantum states corresponding to points in the interior of
the Bloch ball. Due to the existence of logarithm in the quantum divergence,
the diagrams are not defined on pure quantum states corresponding to points on
the two-dimensional sphere. This paper first defines the Voronoi diagrams for
pure quantum states on the Bloch sphere by the Fubini-Study distance and the
Bures distance. We also introduce other Voronoi diagrams on the sphere obtained
by taking a limit of Voronoi diagrams for mixed quantum states by the quantum
divergences in the Bloch ball. These diagrams are shown to be equivalent to the
ordinary Voronoi diagram on the sphere.

the properties of such codes. It is shown that a BCH code of length n can
contain its dual code only if its designed distance d=O(sqrt(n)), and the
converse is proved in the case of narrow-sense codes. Furthermore, the
dimension of narrow-sense BCH codes with small design distance is completely

improved. These results make it possible to determine the parameters of quantum
BCH codes in terms of their design parameters.

sometimes be used to correct more errors than they can uniquely identify. Such
degenerate codes have long been known, but have remained poorly understood. We
provide a heuristic for designing degenerate quantum codes for high noise
rates, which is applied to generate codes that can be used to communicate over
almost any Pauli channel at rates that are impossible for a nondegenerate code.
The gap between nondegenerate and degenerate code performance is quite large,
in contrast to the tiny magnitude of the only previous demonstration of this
effect. We also identify a channel for which none of our codes outperform the
best nondegenerate code and show that it is nevertheless quite unlike any
channel for which nondegenerate codes are known to be optimal.

entanglement for spin-1/2 and spinless fermion systems respectively. Based on
the Jordan-Wigner transformation, any spin-1/2 system is always associated with
a fermion system (called counterpart system). The comparison of concurrence and
mode concurrence can be made with the aid of the Marshall's sign rule for the
ground states of spin-1/2 $XXZ$ and spinless fermion chain systems. We observe
that there exists an inequality between concurrence and mode concurrence for
the ground states of the two corresponding systems. The spin-1/2 XY chain

Boolean valued models of set theory by constructing a model of set theory based
on quantum logic represented by the lattice of closed subspaces in a Hilbert
space and showed that appropriate quantum counterparts of ZFC axioms hold in
the model. Here, Takeuti's formulation is extended to construct a model of set
theory based on the logic represented by the lattice of projections in an
arbitrary von Neumann algebra. A transfer principle is established that enables
us to transfer theorems of ZFC to their quantum counterparts holding in the
model. The set of real numbers in the model is shown to be in one-to-one
correspondence with the set of self-adjoint operators affiliated with the von
Neumann algebra generated by the logic. Despite the difficulty pointed out by
Takeuti that equality axioms do not generally hold in quantum set theory, it is
shown that equality axioms hold for any real numbers in the model. It is also
shown that any observational proposition in quantum mechanics can be
represented by a corresponding statement for real numbers in the model with the
truth value consistent with the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, and
that the equality relation between two real numbers in the model is equivalent
with the notion of perfect correlation between corresponding observables
(self-adjoint operators) in quantum mechanics. The paper is concluded with some
remarks on the relevance to quantum set theory of the choice of the implication
connective in quantum logic.

other quantum process tomography (QPT) schemes. Here we argue that Ziman's
comments regarding optimality, quantumness, and the novelty of DCQD are
inaccurate. Specifically, we demonstrate that DCQD is optimal with respect to
both the required number of experimental configurations and the number of
possible outcomes over all known QPT schemes in the 2^{2n} dimensional Hilbert

efficient than all known QPT schemes in the sense of overall required number of
quantum operations. Furthermore, we argue that DCQD is a new method for
characterizing quantum dynamics and cannot be considered merely as a subclass
of previously known QPT schemes.

focus on two apparently simple cases, full tomography of one and two qubit
systems. We analyze and compare those techniques according to two figures of
merit. Our first criterion is the minimisation of the redundancy of the data
acquired during the tomographic process. In the case of two-qubits tomography,
we also analyze this process from the point of view of factorisability, so to
say we analyze the possibility to realise the tomographic process through local
operations and classical communications between local observers. This brings us
naturally to study the possibility to factorize the (discrete) Wigner
distribution of a composite system into the product of local Wigner
distributions. The discrete Heisenberg-Weyl group is an essential ingredient of
our approach. Possible extensions of our results to higher dimensions are
discussed in the last section and in the conclusions.

  the Lowest Order</title><description>  Current proposals focusing on neutral atoms for quantum computing are mostly
based on using single atoms as quantum bits (qubits), while using cavity
induced coupling or dipole-dipole interaction for two-qubit operations. An
alternative approach is to use atomic ensembles as qubits. However, when an
atomic ensemble is excited, by a laser beam matched to a two-level transition
(or a Raman transition) for example, it leads to a cascade of many states as
more and more photons are absorbed^1. In order to make use of an ensemble as a
qubit, it is necessary to disrupt this cascade, and restrict the excitation to
the absorption (and emission) of a single photon only. Here, we show how this
can be achieved by using a new type of blockade mechanism, based on the
light-shift imbalance (LSI) in a Raman transition. We describe first a simple
example illustrating the concept of light shift imbalanced induced blockade
(LSIIB) using a multi-level structure in a single atom, and show verifications
of the analytic prediction using numerical simulations. We then extend this
model to show how a blockade can be realized by using LSI in the excitation of
an ensemble. Specifically, we show how the LSIIB process enables one to treat
the ensemble as a two level atom that undergoes fully deterministic Rabi
oscillations between two collective quantum states, while suppressing
excitations of higher order collective states.

Deutsch and Wallace to deriving the Born rule for quantum probabilities on the
grounds that it courts circularity. Deutsch and Wallace assume that the many
worlds theory is true and that decoherence gives rise to a preferred basis.
However, decoherence arguments use the reduced density matrix, which relies
upon the partial trace and hence upon the Born Rule for its validity. Using the
Heisenberg Picture and quantum Darwinism - the notion that classical
information is quantum information that can proliferate in the environment
pioneered by Olliver et al - I show that measurement interactions between two
systems only create correlations between a specific set of commuting
observables of system 1 and a specific set of commuting observables of system
2. This argument picks out a unique basis in which information flows in the
correlations between those sets of commuting observables. I then derive the
Born rule for both pure and mixed states and answer some other criticisms of
the decision theoretic approach to quantum probability.

  Transformations of Rational String States</title><description>  This work is based on a description of quantum reference frames that seems
more basic than others in the literature. Here a frame is based on a set of
real and of complex numbers and a space time as a 4-tuple of the real numbers.
There are many isomorphic frames as there are many isomorphic sets of real
numbers. Each frame is suitable for construction of all physical theories as
mathematical structures over the real and complex numbers. The organization of
the frames into a field of frames is based on the representations of real and
complex numbers as Cauchy operators defined on complex rational states of
finite qubit strings. The structure of the field is based on noting that the
construction of real and complex numbers as Cauchy operators in a frame can be
iterated to create new frames coming from a frame. Gauge transformations on the
rational string states greatly expand the number of quantum frames as, for each
gauge U, there is one frame coming from the original frame. Forward and
backward iteration of the construction yields a two way infinite frame field
with satisfying properties. There is no background space time and there are no
real or complex numbers for the field as a whole. Instead these are relative
concepts associated with each frame in the field. Extension to include qukit
strings for different k bases, is described as is the problem of reconciling
the frame field to the existence of just one frame with one background space
time for the observable physical universe.

Predictions for the total outcoupling rate as a function of the radio-frequency

energy integrated outcoupling, which leads to a separate determination of the
coupling strength between the atoms and the radiation field.
  For a non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate analytic solutions are derived
which are subsequently extended to include the effects of atomic interactions.
The interactions enhance interference effects in the beam profile and modify
the outcoupling rate of the atom laser. We provide a complete quantum
mechanical solution which is in line with experimental findings and allows to
determine the validity of commonly used approximative methods.
  We also extend the formalism to a fermionic atom laser and analyze the effect

permanent and transition dipole moments for the Francium dimer and for the RbFr

modelled as a one valence electron moving in the field of the Fr$^+$ core,
which is described by a new pseudopotential with averaged relativistic effects,
and including effective core polarization potential. The molecular calculations
are performed for both the ionic species Fr$\_2^+$, RbFr$^+$, CsFr$^+$ and the
corresponding neutral, through the CIPSI quantum chemistry package where we
used new extended gaussian basis sets for Rb, Cs, and Fr atoms. As no
experimental data is available, we discuss our results by comparison with the
Rb$\_2$, Cs$\_2$, and RbCs systems. The dipole moment of CsFr reveals an
electron transfer yielding a Cs$^+$Fr$^-$ arrangement, while in all other mixed
alkali pairs the electron is transferred towards the lighter species. Finally
the perturbative treatment of the spin-orbit coupling at large distances
predicts that in contrast with Rb$\_2$ and Cs$\_2$, no double-well excited
potential should be present in Fr$\_2$, probably preventing an efficient
formation of cold dimers via photoassociation of cold Francium atoms.

directions by much tighter bounds than the well-known Bell inequality. This
provides a sharper criterion for the experimental distinction between entangled

condition for separability. However, these improved bounds do not apply to
local hidden-variable theories, and hence they provide a criterion to test the
correlations allowed by local hidden-variable theories against those allowed by
separable quantum states. Furthermore, these bounds are stronger than some
recent alternative experimentally accessible entanglement criteria. We also
address the issue of finding a finite subset of these inequalities that would
already form a necessary and sufficient condition for non-entanglement. For
mixed state we have not been able to resolve this, but for pure states a set of
six inequalities using only three sets of orthogonal observables is shown to be
already necessary and sufficient for separability.

  Formulation of Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Bohmian mechanics
as a numerical tool because of its local dynamics, which suggest the
possibility of significant computational advantages for the simulation of large
quantum systems. However, closer inspection of the Bohmian formulation reveals
that the nonlocality of quantum mechanics has not disappeared -- it has simply
been swept under the rug into the quantum force. In this paper we present a new
formulation of Bohmian mechanics in which the quantum action, S, is taken to be
complex. This leads to a single equation for complex S, and ultimately complex
x and p but there is a reward for this complexification -- a significantly
higher degree of localization. The quantum force in the new approach vanishes
for Gaussian wavepacket dynamics, and its effect on barrier tunneling processes
is orders of magnitude lower than that of the classical force. We demonstrate
tunneling probabilities that are in virtually perfect agreement with the exact
quantum mechanics down to 10^{-7} calculated from strictly localized quantum
trajectories that do not communicate with their neighbors. The new formulation
may have significant implications for fundamental quantum mechanics, ranging
from the interpretation of non-locality to measures of quantum complexity.

Such systems correspond to classical Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of

the eigenstates such as particle exchange between the wells and entanglement
without further calculations. In addition, this approach offers new insights
into the validity of the mean-field description of the many particle system by
the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, since we make use of exactly this correspondence

density matrices rho_1,...,rho_m, where each rho_i describes a subset C_i of
the qubits. We say that the rho_i are ``consistent'' if there exists some
global state sigma (on all n qubits) that matches each of the rho_i on the
subsets C_i. This generalizes the classical notion of the consistency of
marginal probability distributions.
  We show that deciding the consistency of local density matrices is
QMA-complete (where QMA is the quantum analogue of NP). This gives an
interesting example of a hard problem in QMA. Our proof is somewhat unusual: we
give a Turing reduction from Local Hamiltonian, using a convex optimization
algorithm by Bertsimas and Vempala, which is based on random sampling. Unlike
in the classical case, simple mapping reductions do not seem to work here.

strong interelectron repulsion relative to the zero-point kinetic energy
associated with the confining potential. Such symmetry breaking leads to the
emergence of crystalline arrangements of electrons in the dot. The so-called
Wigner molecules form already at field-free conditions. The appearance of
rotating Wigner molecules in circular dots under high magnetic field, and their
relation to magic angular momenta and quantum-Hall-effect fractional fillings,
is also discussed. Recent calculations for two electrons in an elliptic quantum
dot, using exact diagonalization and an approximate generalized-Heitler-London
treatment, show that the electrons can localize and form a molecular dimer for
screened interelectron repulsion. The calculated singlet-triplet splitting (J)
as a function of the magnetic field (B) agrees with cotunneling measurements;
its behavior reflects the effective dissociation of the dimer for large B.
Knowledge of the dot shape and of J(B) allows determination of two measures of
entanglement (concurrence and von Neumann entropy for indistinguishable
fermions), whose behavior correlates also with the dissociation of the dimer.
The theoretical value for the concurrence at B=0 agrees with the experimental
estimates.

We prove that this divergence is quite general by studying Hamiltonians of the

then suggested. We introduce the concept of starfunction and use it to
reformulate the Moyal equations in terms of a system of ordinary differential

study the semiclassical expansion of Moyal trajectories, which is cast in terms
of a (order by order in $\hbar$) recursive hierarchy of i) first order partial

  Complexity</title><description>  One of the central issues in the hidden subgroup problem is to bound the
sample complexity, i.e., the number of identical samples of coset states
sufficient and necessary to solve the problem. In this paper, we present
general bounds for the sample complexity of the identification and decision
versions of the hidden subgroup problem. As a consequence of the bounds, we
show that the sample complexity for both of the decision and identification
versions is $\Theta(\log|\HH|/\log p)$ for a candidate set $\HH$ of hidden
subgroups in the case that the candidate subgroups have the same prime order
$p$, which implies that the decision version is at least as hard as the
identification version in this case. In particular, it does so for the
important instances such as the dihedral and the symmetric hidden subgroup
problems. Moreover, the upper bound of the identification is attained by the
pretty good measurement. This shows that the pretty good measurement can
identify any hidden subgroup of an arbitrary group with at most $O(\log|\HH|)$

loop configuration, employing a novel phase modulation scheme based on
frequency shift, and demonstrate stable BB84 QKD operation with high
interference visibility and low quantum bit error rate (QBER). The phase
modulation is achieved by sending two light pulses with a fixed time delay (or
a fixed optical path delay) through a frequency shift element and by modulating
the amount of frequency shift. The relative phase between two light pulses upon
leaving the frequency-shift element is determined by both the time delay (or
the optical path delay) and the frequency shift, and can therefore be
controlled by varying the amount of frequency shift. To demonstrate its
operation, we used an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) as the frequency-shift
element, and vary the driving frequency of the AOM to encode phase
information.The interference visibility for a 40km and a 10km fiber loop is 96%
and 99%, respectively, at single photon level. We ran BB84 protocol in a 40-km
Sagnac loop setup continuously for one hour and the measured QBER remained
within the 2%~5% range. A further advantage of our scheme is that both phase
and amplitude modulation can be achieved simultaneously by frequency and
amplitude modulation of the AOM's driving signal, allowing our QKD system the
capability of implementing other protocols, such as the decoy-state QKD and the
continuous- variable QKD. We also briefly discuss a new type of Eavesdropping

However, it
seems that opinion remains divided about their true quantum character and
content. For example, one argument says that quantum games are nothing but
'disguised' classical games and that to quantize a game is equivalent to
replacing the original game by a different classical game. The present thesis
contributes towards the ongoing debate about quantum nature of quantum games by
developing two approaches addressing the related issues. Both approaches take
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-type experiments as the underlying physical
set-ups to play two-player quantum games. In the first approach, the players'
strategies are unit vectors in their respective planes, with the knowledge of
coordinate axes being shared between them. Players perform measurements in an
EPR-type setting and their payoffs are defined as functions of the
correlations, i.e. without reference to classical or quantum mechanics.
Classical bimatrix games are reproduced if the input states are classical and
perfectly anti-correlated, as for a classical correlation game. However, for a
quantum correlation game, with an entangled singlet state as input,
qualitatively different solutions are obtained. The second approach uses the
result that when the predictions of a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model are
made to violate the Bell inequalities the result is that some probability
measures assume negative values. With the requirement that classical games
result when the predictions of a LHV model do not violate the Bell
inequalities, our analysis looks at the impact which the emergence of negative
probabilities has on the solutions of two-player games which are physically
implemented using the EPR-type experiments.

Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt inequality corresponds to the frustrated square with
the signs +++- for the nearest neighbor interaction between the spins.
Similarly, the Pearle-Braunstein-Cave inequality corresponds to a frustrated
even ring with the corresponding signs +...+-. Upon this correspondence, the
violation of such inequalities by the entangled singlet state in quantum
mechanics is equivalent to the spin system possessing a classical coplanar
ground state, the energy of which is lower than the Ising ground state's
energy. We propose a scheme which generates new inequalities and give further
examples, the frustrated hexagon with additional diagonal bonds and the
frustrated hypercubes in n=3,4,5 dimensions. Surprisingly, the hypercube in n=4

constrained by the Born rule. David Wallace has developed and defended
Deutsch's proposal, and greatly clarified its conceptual basis. In particular,
he has stressed its reliance on the distinguishing symmetry of the Everett
view, viz., that all possible outcomes of a quantum measurement are treated as
equally real. The argument thus tries to make a virtue of what has usually been
seen as the main obstacle to making sense of probability in the Everett world.
In this note I outline some objections to the Deutsch-Wallace argument, and to
related proposals by Hilary Greaves about the epistemology of Everettian QM.
(In the latter case, my arguments include an appeal to an Everettian analogue
of the Sleeping Beauty problem.) The common thread to these objections is that
the symmetry in question remains a very significant obstacle to making sense of
probability in the Everett interpretation.

  mixing</title><description>  In most proposals for the generation of entanglement in large ensembles of
atoms via projective measurements, the interaction with the vacuum is
responsible for both the generation of the signal that is detected and the spin
depolarization or decoherence. In consequence, one has to usually work in a
regime where the information aquisition via detection is sufficiently slow
(weak measurement regime) such as not to strongly disturb the system. We
propose here a four-wave mixing scheme where, owing to the pumping of the
atomic system into a dark state, the polarization of the ensemble is not
critically affected by spontaneous emission, thus allowing one to work in a
strong measurement regime.

exponentially with system size on a classical computer but polynomially using
quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that such algorithms can be applied to
problems of chemical interest using modest numbers of quantum bits.
Calculations of the water and lithium hydride molecular ground-state energies
have been carried out on a quantum computer simulator using a recursive
phase-estimation algorithm. The recursive algorithm reduces the number of
quantum bits required for the readout register from about 20 to 4. Mappings of
the molecular wave function to the quantum bits are described. An adiabatic
method for the preparation of a good approximate ground-state wave function is
described and demonstrated for a stretched hydrogen molecule. The number of
quantum bits required scales linearly with the number of basis functions, and
the number of gates required grows polynomially with the number of quantum
bits.

information against noise with known symmetry properties. Although Hamiltonians
theoretically exist that can implement a universal set of logic gates on DFS
encoded qubits without ever leaving the protected subsystem, the natural
Hamiltonians that are available in specific implementations do not necessarily
have this property. Here we describe some of the principles that can be used in
such cases to operate on encoded qubits without losing the protection offered
by the DFS. In particular, we show how dynamical decoupling can be used to
control decoherence during the unavoidable excursions outside of the DFS. By
means of cumulant expansions, we show how the fidelity of quantum gates
implemented by this method on a simple two-physical-qubit DFS depends on the
correlation time of the noise responsible for decoherence. We further show by
means of numerical simulations how our previously introduced &quot;strongly
modulating pulses&quot; for NMR quantum information processing can permit
high-fidelity operations on multiple DFS encoded qubits in practice, provided
that the rate at which the system can be modulated is fast compared to the
correlation time of the noise. The principles thereby illustrated are expected
to be broadly applicable to many implementations of quantum information
processors based on DFS encoded qubits.

the Kubo formula and the Slater-Koster tight binding model, where parameters
are determined from the least-square fitting of the dispersion curves by the
tight binding model to those by the first principles calculation. In the

spin-polarized transport. In addition, by comparing Fe$_4$N to fcc-Fe

explore some of the physical insights to be gained by extending dualism to
higher orders. Recent experiments have examined aspects of the coherence of
Bose-Einstein condensates. It has been argued that the condensate state is
coherent to (at least) second or third order, but the coherence properties of
Bose-Einstein condensates remain somewhat controversial. Using probability
distributions developed by M. O. Scully and V. V. Kocharovsky et. al., we apply
Gordon's dualistic expression of the coherence conditions to investigate
coherence properties in Bose-Einstein condensation. Via numerical calculations,
we present a graphical survey of wave-like and particle-like fluctuations in
condensed and uncondensed fractions. Near the critical point, we find a very
marked peak in the ratio of nth order wave to nth order particle fluctuations
in the condensate. Not surprisingly, n-point correlations between the positions
of condensate atoms also peak near the critical temperature, and this
apparently mirrors, to higher orders, the well-known relation between the

Theoretically, there are subtle issues concerning thermodynamics and

that suggests that the temperature correction to the Casimir effect is
relatively large, and should be observable in future experiments involving

potential of $V(r,\theta) = D({\frac{r - a}{r}})^2+{\frac{\beta}{r^2\sin^2
\theta}}+{\frac{\gamma \cos \theta}{r^2\sin^2 \theta}}$ type, which may be
called as the modified non-central Kratzer potential. The energy eigenvalues as
well as the corresponding eigenfunctions are calculated for various values of
$n$ and $m$ quantum numbers within the framework of the Nikiforov-Uvarov and
Asymtotic Iteration Methods for the $CO$ diatomic molecule as an application of
this potential. In this paper, we first present the effect of the non-central
term on the bound-state energy eigenvalues: this effect is determined
explicitly for different $n$ and $m$ quantum numbers with $\beta=\gamma$=0.0,
0.1, 1.0 and 5.0 values and the results are compared with the findings of the
modified Kratzer potential for different $n$ and $l$ quantum numbers. Then, we
show that the angle-dependent non-central part behaves like a centrifugal
barrier and it reduces the depth of the attractive potential pocket, which
effects the bound-state energy eigenvalues.

  Representation</title><description>  Stinespring's dilation theorem is the basic structure theorem for quantum
channels: it states that any quantum channel arises from a unitary evolution on
a larger system. Here we prove a continuity theorem for Stinespring's dilation:
if two quantum channels are close in cb-norm, then it is always possible to
find unitary implementations which are close in operator norm, with
dimension-independent bounds. This result generalizes Uhlmann's theorem from
states to channels and allows to derive a formulation of the
information-disturbance tradeoff in terms of quantum channels, as well as a
continuity estimate for the no-broadcasting theorem. We briefly discuss further
implications for quantum cryptography, thermalization processes, and the black

probability distribution, or {\it measure}, whose marginals yield the
probabilities produced by the spin measurements in question. The existence of a
joint measure is in turn equivalent to a certain causality condition known as
``screening off''. We show that if one assumes, more generally, a joint {\it
quantal measure}, or ``decoherence functional'', one obtains instead an
analogous inequality weaker by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. The proof of this
``Tsirel'son inequality'' is geometrical and rests on the possibility of
associating a Hilbert space to any strongly positive quantal measure. These
results lead both to a {\it question}: ``Does a joint measure follow from some
quantal analog of `screening off'?'', and to the {\it observation} that
non-contextual hidden variables are viable in histories-based quantum
mechanics, even if they are excluded classically.

based on moments of annihilation and creation operators are studied by
developing the idea of Shchukin-Vogel criterion [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 95},
230502 (2005)]. If a state is separable, then the corresponding matrix of
moments is separable too. Thus, we derive generalized criteria, based on the
separability properties of the matrix of moments, are thus derived. In
particular, a new criterion based on realignment of moments in the matrix is
proposed as an analogue of the standard realignment criterion for density
matrices. Other inseparability inequalities are obtained by applying positive
maps to the matrix of moments. Usefulness of the Shchukin-Vogel criterion to
describe bipartite-entanglement of more than two modes is demonstrated: We
obtain some previously known three-mode inseparability criteria originally
derived from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and we introduce new ones.

  probabilistic gates</title><description>  We establish bounds to the necessary resource consumption when building up
cluster states for one-way computing using probabilistic gates. Emphasis is put
on state preparation with linear optical gates, as the probabilistic character
is unavoidable here. We identify rigorous general bounds to the necessary
consumption of initially available maximally entangled pairs when building up
one-dimensional cluster states with individually acting linear optical quantum
gates, entangled pairs and vacuum modes. As the known linear optics gates have
a limited maximum success probability, as we show, this amounts to finding the
optimal classical strategy of fusing pieces of linear cluster states. A formal
notion of classical configurations and strategies is introduced for
probabilistic non-faulty gates. We study the asymptotic performance of
strategies that can be simply described, and prove ultimate bounds to the
performance of the globally optimal strategy. The arguments employ methods of
random walks and convex optimization. This optimal strategy is also the one
that requires the shortest storage time, and necessitates the fewest
invocations of probabilistic gates. For two-dimensional cluster states, we
find, for any elementary success probability, an essentially deterministic
preparation of a cluster state with quadratic, hence optimal, asymptotic
scaling in the use of entangled pairs. We also identify a percolation effect in
state preparation, in that from a threshold probability on, almost all
preparations will be either successful or fail. We outline the implications on
linear optical architectures and fault-tolerant computations.

The subsequent measurements made around this point show complete agreement with

equations of motion that are historically called non-Lagrangian equations. Our
viewpoint of this problem is the following: despite the fact that a set of
differential equations cannot be directly identified with a set of
Euler-Lagrange equations, one can reformulate such a set in an equivalent
first-order form which can always be treated as the Euler-Lagrange equations of
a certain action. We construct such an action explicitly. It turns out that in
the general case the hamiltonization and canonical quantization of such an
action are non-trivial problems, since the theory involves time-dependent
constraints. We adopt the general approach of hamiltonization and canonical
quantization for such theories (Gitman, Tyutin, 1990) to the case under
consideration. There exists an ambiguity (not reduced to a total time
derivative) in associating a Lagrange function with a given set of equations.
We present a complete description of this ambiguity. The proposed scheme is
applied to the quantization of a general quadratic theory. In addition, we
consider the quantization of a damped oscillator and of a radiating point-like
charge.

  nonlinear quantum lattice</title><description>  By using a Generalized Hubbard model for bosons, the energy transfer in a
nonlinear quantum lattice is studied, with special emphasis on the interplay
between local and nonlocal nonlinearity. For a strong local nonlinearity, it is
shown that the creation of v quanta on one site excites a soliton band formed
by bound states involving v quanta trapped on the same site. The energy is
first localized on the excited site over a significant timescale and then
slowly delocalizes along the lattice. As when increasing the nonlocal
nonlinearity, a faster dynamics occurs and the energy propagates more rapidly
along the lattice. Nevertheless, the larger is the number of quanta, the slower
is the dynamics. However, it is shown that when the nonlocal nonlinearity
reaches a critical value, the lattice suddenly supports a very fast energy
propagation whose dynamics is almost independent on the number of quanta. The
energy is transfered by specific bound states formed by the superimposition of
states involving v-p quanta trapped on one site and p quanta trapped on the
nearest neighbour sites, with p=0,..,v-1. These bound states behave as
independent quanta and they exhibit a dynamics which is insensitive to the
nonlinearity and controlled by the single quantum hopping constant.

Using the Feynman-Vernon approach and treating the chaotic system
semiclassically we show that the effects of the low dimensional chaotic

classical correlation and response functions play important roles in both
classical and quantum formulations. Our results are qualitatively similar to

  Non-relativistic Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  We use a new distinctly &quot;geometrical&quot; interpretation of non-relativistic
quantum mechanics (NRQM) to argue for the fundamentality of the 4D blockworld
ontology. Our interpretation rests on two formal results: Kaiser, Bohr &amp;
Ulfbeck and Anandan showed independently that the Heisenberg commutation
relations of NRQM follow from the relativity of simultaneity (RoS) per the
Poincare Lie algebra, and Bohr, Ulfbeck &amp; Mottelson showed that the density
matrix for a particular NRQM experimental outcome may be obtained from the
spacetime symmetry group of the experimental configuration. Together these
formal results imply that contrary to accepted wisdom, NRQM, the measurement
problem and so-called quantum non-locality do not provide reasons to abandon
the 4D blockworld implication of RoS. After discussing the full philosophical
implications of these formal results, we motivate and derive the Born rule in
the context of our ontology of spacetime relations via Anandan. Finally, we
apply our explanatory and descriptive methodology to a particular experimental
set-up (the so-called &quot;quantum liar experiment&quot;) and thereby show how the
blockworld view is not only consistent with NRQM, not only an implication of
our geometrical interpretation of NRQM, but it is necessary in a non-trivial
way for explaining quantum interference and &quot;non-locality&quot; from the spacetime
perspective.

  Algorithms</title><description>  The goal of this paper is to study the effect of entanglement on the running
time of a quantum computation. Adiabatic quantum computation is suited to this
kind of study, since it allows us to explicitly calculate the time evolution of
the entanglement throughout the calculation. On the other hand however, the
adiabatic formalism makes it impossible to study the roles of entanglement and
fidelity separately, which means that results have to be interpreted carefully.
We study two algorithms: the search algorithm and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm.
We find some evidence that entanglement can be considered a resource in quantum
computation.

i.e., a completely positive trace preserving linear transformation (a CPTP map)
whose inverse is also a CPTP map. The precise form of such maps becomes
important in contexts such as self-testing and encryption. We show that these
maps correspond to applying a unitary transformation to the state along with an
ancilla initialized to a fixed state, which may be mixed.
  The characterization of invertible quantum operations implies that one-way
schemes for encrypting quantum states using a classical key may be slightly
more general than the ``private quantum channels'' studied by Ambainis, Mosca,
Tapp and de Wolf (FOCS 2000). Nonetheless, we show that their results, most
notably a lower bound of 2n bits of key to encrypt n quantum bits, extend in a
straightforward manner to the general case.

quantum physics. When coupling is strong enough to prevail over decoherence, it
can be used for the engineering of correlated quantum states. Especially for
solid-state systems, control of quantum correlations has attracted widespread
attention because of applications in quantum computing. Such coherent coupling
has been demonstrated in a variety of systems at low temperature1, 2. Of all
quantum systems, spins are potentially the most important, because they offer
very long phase memories, sometimes even at room temperature. Although precise
control of spins is well established in conventional magnetic resonance3, 4,
existing techniques usually do not allow the readout of single spins because of
limited sensitivity. In this paper, we explore dipolar magnetic coupling
between two single defects in diamond (nitrogen-vacancy and nitrogen) using
optical readout of the single nitrogen-vacancy spin states. Long phase memory
combined with a defect separation of a few lattice spacings allow us to explore
the strong magnetic coupling regime. As the two-defect system was well-isolated
from other defects, the long phase memory times of the single spins was not
diminished, despite the fact that dipolar interactions are usually seen as
undesirable sources of decoherence. A coherent superposition of spin pair
quantum states was achieved. The dipolar coupling was used to transfer spin
polarisation from a nitrogen-vacancy centre spin to a nitrogen spin, with
optical pumping of a nitrogen-vacancy centre leading to efficient
initialisation. At the level anticrossing efficient nuclear spin polarisation
was achieved. Our results demonstrate an important step towards controlled spin
coupling and multi-particle entanglement in the solid state.

$J(t)\propto e^{-\gamma t}$, an adapted mean-field expansion for large fillings

The present paper reports a new limit on the probability that PEP is violated

a ground state already occupied by 2 electrons. The obtained value, ${1/2}

interpretation for quantum mechanics formalism. The distinctive feature of this
work is that it combines geometrization of electromagnetic field and
geometrization of material field within the unique topological idea. According
to the suggested topological interpretation, the Dirac equations for a free
particle and for a hydrogen atom prove to be the group--theoretical relations
that account for the symmetry properties of localized microscopic deviations of
the space--time geometry from the pseudoeuclidean one (closed topological
4-manifolds). These equations happen to be written in universal covering spaces
of the above manifolds. It is shown that &quot;long derivatives&quot; in Dirac equation
for a hydrogen atom can be considered as covariant derivatives of spinors in
the Weyl noneuclidean 4-space and that electromagnetic potentials can be
considered as connectivities in this space. The gauge invariance of
electromagnetic field proves to be a natural consequence of the basic
principles of the proposed geometrical interpretation. Within the suggested
concept, atoms have no inside any point-like particles (electrons) and this can
give an opportunity to overcome the difficulties of atomic physics connected
with the many-body problem.

non-Hermitian $\cP\cT$-symmetric wrong-sign quartic Hamiltonian $H=\half
p^2-gx^4$ has the same spectrum as the conventional Hermitian Hamiltonian
$\tilde H=\half p^2+4g x^4-\sqrt{2g} x$. Here, this equivalence is demonstrated
very simply by means of differential-equation techniques and, more importantly,
by means of functional-integration techniques. It is shown that the linear term
in the Hermitian Hamiltonian is anomalous; that is, this linear term has no
classical analog. The anomaly arises because of the broken parity symmetry of
the original non-Hermitian $\cP\cT$-symmetric Hamiltonian. This anomaly in the
Hermitian form of a $\cP\cT$-symmetric quartic Hamiltonian is unchanged if a
harmonic term is introduced into $H$. When there is a harmonic term, an
immediate physical consequence of the anomaly is the appearance of bound
states; if there were no anomaly term, there would be no bound states. Possible
extensions of this work to $-\phi^4$ quantum field theory in higher-dimensional
space-time are discussed.

offer unconditionally secure information transport guaranteed by
quantum-mechanical laws. Such potentially disruptive security technologies
could be of high strategic and economic value in the future. Two major issues
confronting researchers in this field are the transmission range (typically
&lt;100km) and the key exchange rate, which can be as low as a few bits per second
at long optical fiber distances. This paper describes further research of an
approach to significantly enhance the key exchange rate in an optical fiber
system at distances in the range of 1-20km. We will present results on a number
of application scenarios, including point-to-point links and multi-user

standard telecommunications optical fiber, and which are capable of operating

emission wavelengths of 850 nm as weak coherent light sources, as well as
silicon single-photon avalanche diodes as the single photon detectors. The

biorthogonal eigenfunctions $\phi_\lambda$ and define the value $r_\lambda =
(\phi_\lambda|\phi_\lambda)/&lt;\phi_\lambda|\phi_\lambda&gt;$ that characterizes the
phase rigidity of the eigenfunctions $\phi_\lambda$. In the scenario with
avoided level crossings, $r_\lambda$ varies between 1 and 0 due to the mutual
influence of neighboring resonances. The variation of $r_\lambda$ may be
considered as an internal property of an {\it open} quantum system. In the
literature, the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the scattering wave function
$\Psi^E_C$ is considered. Since $\Psi^E_C$ can be represented in the interior
of the system by the $\phi_\lambda$, the phase rigidity $\rho$ of the
$\Psi^E_C$ is related to the $r_\lambda$ and therefore also to the mutual
influence of neighboring resonances. As a consequence, the reduction of the
phase rigidity $\rho$ to values smaller than 1 should be considered, at least
partly, as an internal property of an open quantum system in the overlapping
regime. The relation to measurable values such as the transmission through a
quantum dot, follows from the fact that the transmission is, in any case,
resonant with respect to the effective Hamiltonian. We illustrate the relation
between phase rigidity $\rho$ and transmission numerically for small open

  potential scattering problem</title><description>  In quantum mechanics, systems can be described in phase space in terms of the
Wigner function and the star-product operation. Quantum characteristics, which
appear in the Heisenberg picture as the Weyl's symbols of operators of
canonical coordinates and momenta, can be used to solve the evolution equations
for symbols of other operators acting in the Hilbert space. To any fixed order
in the Planck's constant, many-body potential scattering problem simplifies to
a statistical-mechanical problem of computing an ensemble of quantum
characteristics and their derivatives with respect to the initial canonical
coordinates and momenta. The reduction to a system of ordinary differential
equations pertains rigorously at any fixed order in $\hbar$. We present
semiclassical expansion of quantum characteristics for many-body scattering
problem and provide tools for calculation of average values of time-dependent
physical observables and cross sections. The method of quantum characteristics
admits the consistent incorporation of specific quantum effects, such as
non-locality and coherence in propagation of particles, into the semiclassical
transport models. We formulate the principle of stationary action for quantum
Hamilton's equations and give quantum-mechanical extensions of the Liouville
theorem on the conservation of phase-space volume and the Poincar\'e theorem on
the conservation of $2p$ forms. The lowest order quantum corrections to the
Kepler periodic orbits are constructed. These corrections show the resonance
behavior.

  IGM Heating</title><description>  We study lower and upper bounds on the parameters for stochastic state vector
reduction, focusing on the mass-proportional continuous spontaneous
localization (CSL) model. We show that the assumption that the state vector is
reduced whan a latent image is formed, in photography or etched track
detection, requires a CSL rate parameter $\lambda$ that is larger than
conventionally assumed by a factor of roughly $2 \times 10^{9\pm 2}$, for a
correlation length $r_C$ of $10^{-5}{\rm cm}$. We reanalyze existing upper
bounds on the reduction rate and conclude that all are compatible with such an
increase in $\lambda$. The best bounds that we have obtained come from a
consideration of heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM), which shows that
$\lambda$ can be at most $\sim 10^{8\pm 1}$ times as large as the standard CSL
value, again for $r_C=10^{-5} {\rm cm}$. (For both the lower and upper bounds,
quoted errors are not purely statistical errors, but rather are estimates
reflecting modeling uncertainties.) We discuss modifications in our analysis
corresponding to a larger value of $r_C$. With a substantially enlarged rate
parameter, CSL effects may be within range of experimental detection (or
refutation) with current technologies. ADDED NOTE: A careful calculation of
radiation from atomic systems in the CSL model (Adler and Ramazanoglu,
arXiv:0707.3134) has reinstated the bound obtained by Fu as the best upper
bound on lambda, with significant implications for CSL model phenomenology.

based on the equivalence class $\{e^{i\alpha(t)}\psi(t,\vec{x})\}$ which is not
a symmetry of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation. This equivalence class when
understood as defining generalized rays in the Hilbert space is not generally
consistent with the superposition principle in interference and polarization
phenomena. The hidden local gauge symmetry, which arises from the arbitrariness
of the choice of coordinates in the functional space, is then proposed as a
basic gauge symmetry in the non-adiabatic phase. This re-formulation reproduces
all the successful aspects of the non-adiabatic phase in a manner manifestly
consistent with the conventional notion of rays and the superposition
principle. The hidden local symmetry is thus identified as the natural origin
of the gauge symmetry in both of the adiabatic and non-adiabatic phases in the
absence of gauge fields, and it allows a unified treatment of all the geometric
phases. The non-adiabatic phase may well be regarded as a special case of the
adiabatic phase in this re-formulation, contrary to the customary understanding
of the adiabatic phase as a special case of the non-adiabatic phase. Some
explicit examples of geometric phases are discussed to illustrate this
re-formulation.

orthonormal bases in $\mathbb C^d, B {and} B'$ are said mutually unbiased if
$\forall b\in B, b'\in B'$ the scalar product $b\cdot b'$ has modulus
$d^{-1/2}$. In particular this property has been introduced in order to allow
an optimization of the measurement-driven quantum evolution process of any

$B\_{j} {of} \mathbb C^d$. At present it is an open problem to find the maximal
umber of mutually Unbiased Bases when $d$ is not a power of a prime number.
\noindent In this article, we revisit the problem of finding Mutually Unbiased
Bases (MUB's) in any dimension $d$. The method is very elementary, using the
simple unitary matrices introduced by Schwinger in 1960, together with their
diagonalizations. The Vandermonde matrix based on the $d$-th roots of unity
plays a major role. This allows us to show the existence of a set of 3 MUB's in
any dimension, to give conditions for existence of more than 3 MUB's for $d$
even or odd number, and to recover the known result of existence of $d+1$ MUB's
for $d$ a prime number. Furthermore the construction of these MUB's is very
explicit. As a by-product, we recover results about Gauss Sums, known in number
theory, but which have apparently not been previously derived from MUB
properties.

be visualized as a homological quantum code. We study the problem of
constructing quantum codes with optimal encoding rate. In the particular case
of toric codes we construct an optimal family and give an explicit proof of its
optimality. For homological quantum codes on surfaces of arbitrary genus we
also construct a family of codes asymptotically attaining the maximum possible
encoding rate. We provide the tools of homology group theory for graphs
embedded on surfaces in a self-contained manner.

networks, and can also serve as an elementary operation in quantum computers.
Teleportation was first demonstrated as a transfer of a quantum state of light
onto another light beam; later developments used optical relays and
demonstrated entanglement swapping for continuous variables. The teleportation
of a quantum state between two single material particles (trapped ions) has now
also been achieved. Here we demonstrate teleportation between objects of a
different nature - light and matter, which respectively represent 'flying' and
'stationary' media. A quantum state encoded in a light pulse is teleported onto
a macroscopic object (an atomic ensemble containing 10^12 caesium atoms).
Deterministic teleportation is achieved for sets of coherent states with mean
photon number (n) up to a few hundred. The fidelities are 0.58+-0.02 for n=20
and 0.60+-0.02 for n=5 - higher than any classical state transfer can possibly
achieve. Besides being of fundamental interest, teleportation using a
macroscopic atomic ensemble is relevant for the practical implementation of a
quantum repeater. An important factor for the implementation of quantum
networks is the teleportation distance between transmitter and receiver; this
is 0.5 metres in the present experiment. As our experiment uses propagating
light to achieve the entanglement of light and atoms required for
teleportation, the present approach should be scalable to longer distances.

interplay between unitary and non-unitary evolution. Such complementarity is
also at the basis of the so-called interaction-free measurement.

must exist an inherently quantum, and spacetime independent, formulation of
this theory. Independent of string theory, there should exist a description of
quantum mechanics which does not refer to a classical spacetime manifold. We
propose such a formulation of quantum mechanics, based on noncommutative

external classical spacetime is available. However, near the Planck energy
scale, self-gravity effects modify the Schrodinger equation to the non-linear
Doebner-Goldin equation. Remarkably, this non-linear equation also arises in
the quantum dynamics of D0-branes. This suggests that the noncommutative
quantum dynamics introduced here is actually the quantum gravitational dynamics
of D0-branes, and that automorphism invariance is a symmetry of string theory.

quantum fields undergo cross-phase modulation induced by electromagnetically
induced transparency. The performance of this two-qubit quantum phase gate for
travelling single-photon qubits is thoroughly examined in the steady-state and

In the steady-state regime, we find a general trade-off between the size of the

trade-off can be bypassed in the transient regime, where a satisfactory gate
operation is found to be possible, significantly reducing the gate operation

which equals to the minimum energy of any separable state. There is a
characteristic temperature below that an entangled thermal state exists. The
characteristic temperature for thermal entanglement is increased with spin $s$.
When the total number of lattice is increased, the characteristic temperature
decreases and then approaches a constant. This effect shows that the thermal
entanglement can be detected in a real solid state system of larger number of
lattices for finite temperature. The comparison of negativity and entanglement
witness is obtained from the separability of the unentangled states. It is
found that the thermal energy provides a sufficient condition for the existence

unifying framework based on a symmetry principle. These symmetries may be
actual invariances of the system, or may emerge in the low-energy sector.
Prominent examples of Topological Quantum Order display Gauge-Like Symmetries.
New systems exhibiting such symmetries include Hamiltonians depicting
orbital-dependent spin exchange and Jahn-Teller effects in transition metal
orbital compounds, short-range frustrated Klein spin models, and p+ip
superconducting arrays. We analyze the physical consequences of Gauge-Like
Symmetries (including topological terms and charges), discuss associated
braiding, and show the insufficiency of the energy spectrum, topological
entanglement entropy, maximal string correlators, and fractionalization in
establishing Topological Quantum Order. General symmetry considerations
illustrate that not withstanding spectral gaps, thermal fluctuations may impose

&quot;thermal fragility&quot;. Our results allow us to go beyond standard topological

typically lead to entanglement-entropies of subvolumes proportional to the area
of the dividing surface. Macroscopically excited (vector)states have in the
generic case an entanglement-entropy which is proportional to the enclosed
subvolume and, furthermore, display a certain Gibbsian behavior. Low-lying
excited states, on the other hand, lead to an entanglement-entropy which is

obtained using information-theoretic arguments. The nonlinearities in that
equation were of a nonpolynomial form, equivalent to the occurence of
higher-derivative nonlinear terms at all orders. Here we construct some exact
solutions to that equation in 1+1 dimensions. On the half-line, the solutions
resemble exponentially damped Bloch waves even though no external periodic
potential is included: the periodicity is induced by the nonpolynomiality. The
solutions are nonperturbative as they do not reduce to solutions of the linear
theory in the limit that the nonlinearity parameter vanishes. An intriguing
feature of the solutions is their infinite degeneracy: for a given energy,
there exists a very large arbitrariness in the normalisable wavefunctions. We
also consider solutions to a q-deformed version of the nonlinear equation and
discuss a natural discretisation implied by the nonpolynomiality. Finally, we
contrast the properties of our solutions with other solutions of nonlinear
Schrodinger equations in the literature and suggest some possible applications
of our results in the domains of low-energy and high-energy physics.

generated in polynomial time from two-qubit gates picked at random. We prove as
the main result that such a process generates the average entanglement of the
uniform (Haar) measure in at most $O(N^3)$ steps for $N$ qubits. This is
despite an exponentially growing number of such gates being necessary for
generating that measure fully on the state space. Numerics furthermore show a
variation cut-off allowing one to associate a specific time with the
achievement of the uniform measure entanglement distribution. Various
extensions of this work are discussed. The results are relevant to entanglement
theory and to protocols that assume generic entanglement can be achieved
efficiently.

that the effect of the boundary on the von Neumann entropy decays exponentially
fast in the distance between the subsystem considered and the boundary sites.
  Further, we show that as the size of the subsystem increases, its von Neumann
entropy exponentially approaches the summation of the von Neumann entropies of
the two ends, the exponent being related to the size. In contrast to critical
systems, where boundary effects to the von Neumann entropy decay slowly, the

  Curiously, while the boundary operators decrease the von Neumann entropy of L

state generically develop quantum correlations -- entanglement. As a
consequence, a local description of interacting quantum system is impossible as
a rule. A unitarily evolving (isolated) quantum system generically develops
extensive entanglement: the magnitude of the generated entanglement will
increase without bounds with the effective Hilbert space dimension of the
system. It is conceivable, that coupling of the interacting subsystems to local
dephasing environments will restrict the generation of entanglement to such
extent, that the evolving composite system may be considered as approximately
disentangled. This conjecture is addressed in the context of some common models
of a bipartite system with linear and nonlinear interactions and local coupling
to dephasing environments. Analytical and numerical results obtained imply that
the conjecture is generally false. Open dynamics of the quantum correlations is
compared to the corresponding evolution of the classical correlations and a

to a complete set of biorthogonal wave functions that can be used as a basis to

shifted to resonance with a trap eigenstate. We verify the accuracy of the
pseudopotential approach using a toy model in which a square well acts as the

entanglement was studied in similar circuits. The device consists of a
superconducting beam splitter connected to two electronic Mach-Zehnder
interferometers. In each arms of the interferometers, energies are filtered
with coherent quantum dots. In contrast to previous studies of zero-frequency
cross-correlations of electrical currents for this system, attention is drawn
to finite-time measurements. This allows to observe two-particle interference
for particles with different energies above and below Fermi level. Entanglement
is first characterized via the concurrence for the two-particle spatial density
matrix. Next, we formulate the Bell inequality, which is written in terms of
finite-time noise correlators, and thereby we find a specific set of parameters
for which entanglement can be detected.

  Experiments with Dichotomic Observables</title><description>  In this paper we explore further the connections between convex bodies
related to quantum correlation experiments with dichotomic variables and
related bodies studied in combinatorial optimization, especially cut polyhedra.
Such a relationship was established in Avis, Imai, Ito and Sasaki (2005 J.
Phys. A: Math. Gen. 38 10971-87) with respect to Bell inequalities. We show
that several well known bodies related to cut polyhedra are equivalent to
bodies such as those defined by Tsirelson (1993 Hadronic J. S. 8 329-45) to
represent hidden deterministic behaviors, quantum behaviors, and no-signalling
behaviors. Among other things, our results allow a unique representation of
these bodies, give a necessary condition for vertices of the no-signalling
polytope, and give a method for bounding the quantum violation of Bell
inequalities by means of a body that contains the set of quantum behaviors.
Optimization over this latter body may be performed efficiently by semidefinite
programming. In the second part of the paper we apply these results to the
study of classical correlation functions. We provide a complete list of tight
inequalities for the two party case with (m,n) dichotomic observables when
m=4,n=4 and when min{m,n}&lt;=3, and give a new general family of correlation
inequalities.

commitment, introduced independently by Aharonov et al. [STOC, 2000] and Hardy
and Kent [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 (2004)] is investigated. In this variant, the
parties require some nonzero probability of detecting a cheating, i.e. if Bob,
who commits a bit b to Alice, changes his mind during the revealing phase then
Alice detects the cheating with a positive probability (we call this property
binding); and if Alice gains information about the committed bit before the
revealing phase then Bob discovers this with positive probability (sealing). In
our paper we give quantum bit commitment scheme that is simultaneously binding
and sealing and we show that if a cheating gives epsilon advantage to a
malicious Alice then Bob can detect the cheating with a probability
Omega(epsilon^2). If Bob cheats then Alice's probability of detecting the
cheating is greater than some fixed constant lambda&gt;0. This improves the
probabilities of cheating detections shown by Hardy and Kent and the scheme by
Aharonov et al. who presented a protocol that is either binding or sealing, but
not simultaneously both. To construct a cheat sensitive quantum bit commitment

two parts, we will face a situation that, within a certain length $\xi$, the
physics of a subsystem is no longer the same as the original system. Then the
extensive properties of the thermal entropy $S($AB$)= S($A$)+S($B$)$ is
violated. This observation motivates us to introduce the concept of correlation
entropy between two points, as measured by mutual information in the
information theory, to study the critical phenomena. A rigorous relation is
established to display some drastic features of the non-vanishing correlation
entropy of the subsystem formed by any two distant particles with long-range
correlation. This relation actually indicates the universal role of the
correlation entropy in understanding critical phenomena. We also verify these
analytical studies in terms of two well-studied models for both the thermal and
quantum phase transitions: two-dimensional Ising model and one-dimensional
transverse field Ising model. Therefore, the correlation entropy provides us

quantum dots system. Three quantum dots with three electrons are used to
perform teleportation, the unknown qubit is encoded using one electron spin on
quantum dot A, the other two dots B and C are coupled to form a mixed
space-spin entangled state. By choosing the Hamiltonian for the mixed
space-spin entangled system, we can filter the space (spin) entanglement to
obtain pure spin (space) entanglement and after a Bell measurement, the unknown
qubit is transfered to quantum dot B. Selecting an appropriate Hamiltonian for
the quantum gate allows the spin-based information to be transformed into a
charge-based information. The possibility of generalizing this model to
N-electrons is discussed.

decoherence in closed quantum systems. For this purpose, we present a
quantifiable definition to quantum coherence $\Xi$, and discuss in some detail
a general coherence theory and its elementary results. As expected, decoherence
is understood as a statistical process that is caused by the dynamics of the
system, similar to the growth of entropy. It appears that coherence is an
important measure that helps to understand quantum properties of a system,
e.g., the decoherence time can be derived from the coherence function $\Xi(t)$,
but not from the entropy dynamics. Moreover, the concept of decoherence time is
applicable in closed and finite systems. However, in most cases, the decay of
off-diagonal elements differs from the usual $\exp(-t/\tau_{\rm d})$ behaviour.
For concreteness, we report the form of decoherence time $\tau_{\rm d}$ in a
finite Heisenberg model with respect to the number of particles $N$, density
$n_{\rho}$, spatial dimension $D$ and $\epsilon$ in a $\eta/r^{\epsilon}$-type
of potential.

  Effects of a squeezed probe field</title><description>  The interaction of a quantized field with three-level atoms in $\Lambda$
configuration inside a two mode cavity is analyzed. We calculate the stationary
quadrature noise spectrum of the field outside the cavity in the case where the
input probe field is in a squeezed state and the atoms show electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT). If the Rabi frequencies of both dipole transitions
of the atoms are different from zero, we show that the output probe field have
four maxima of squeezing absorption. We show that in some cases two of these
frequencies can be very close to the transition frequency of the atom, in a
region where the mean value of the field entering the cavity is hardly altered.
Furthermore, part of the absorbed squeezing of the probe field is transfered to
the pump field. For some conditions this transfer of squeezing can be complete.

Decoherence of the pair is evaluated analytically in terms of purity; Monte

the scalability of previous schemes. We further consider how to suppress this

canonical-ensemble thermal state is entangled in two distinct temperature
regions. In most cases the ground state is entangled; however we have also
found an example where the ground state is separable and there are still two
regions. This demonstrates that the qualitative behavior of entanglement with
temperature can be much more complicated than might otherwise have been
expected; it is not simply determined by the entanglement of the ground state,
even for the simple case of two qubits. Furthermore, we prove a finite bound on
the number of possible entangled regions for two qubits, thus showing that
arbitrarily many transitions from entanglement to separability are not
possible. We also provide an elementary proof that the spectrum of the thermal
state at a lower temperature majorizes that at a higher temperature, for any
Hamiltonian, and use this result to show that only one entangled region is
possible for the special case of Hamiltonians without magnetic fields.

error correcting protocols designed for tolerance against qubit loss, it was
shown that these protocols have the undesirable effect of magnifying the
effects of depolarization noise. This raises the question of which general
properties of quantum error-correcting codes might explain such an apparent
trade-off between tolerance to located and unlocated error types. We extend the
counting argument behind the well-known quantum Hamming bound to derive a bound
on the weights of combinations of located and unlocated errors which are
correctable by nondegenerate quantum codes. Numerical results show that the
bound gives an excellent prediction to which combinations of unlocated and
located errors can be corrected with high probability by certain large
degenerate codes. The numerical results are explained partly by showing that
the generalized bound, like the original, is closely connected to the
information-theoretic quantity the quantum coherent information. However, we
also show that as a measure of the exact performance of quantum codes, our
generalized Hamming bound is provably far from tight.

providing additive approximations of the Jones polynomial at the k'th root of
unity, for constant k=5 and k&gt;6, is BQP-hard. Together with the algorithmic
results of Freedman et al and Aharonov et al, this gives perhaps the most
natural BQP-complete problem known today and motivates further study of the
topic. In this paper we focus on the universality proof; we extend the
universality result of Freedman et al to k's that grow polynomially with the
number of strands and crossings in the link, thus extending the BQP-hardness of
Jones polynomial approximations to all values for which the AJL algorithm
applies, proving that for all those values, the problems are BQP-complete. As a
side benefit, we derive a fairly elementary proof of the Freedman et al density
result, without referring to advanced results from Lie algebra representation
theory, making this important result accessible to computer science audience.
We make use of two general lemmas we prove, the Bridge lemma and the Decoupling
lemma, which provide tools for establishing density of subgroups in SU(n).
Those tools seem to be of independent interest in more general contexts of
proving quantum universality. Our result also implies a completely classical
statement, that the_multiplicative_ approximations of the Jones polynomial, at
exactly the same values, are #P-hard, via a recent result due to Kuperberg.
Since the first publication of those results in their preliminary form
(arXiv:quant-ph/0605181v2), the methods we present here were used in several
other contexts. This paper is an improved and extended version of the original
results, and also includes discussions of the developments since then.

That is, if we write its quantum correlations as a mixture of local
correlations and general (not necessarily quantum) correlations, the
coefficient of the local correlations must be zero. This suggests an
experimental programme to obtain as good an upper bound as possible on the
fraction of local states, and provides a lower bound on the amount of classical
communication needed to simulate a maximally entangled state in dxd dimensions.
We also prove that the quantum correlations violating the inequality are
monogamous among non-signalling correlations, and hence can be used for quantum
key distribution secure against post-quantum (but non-signalling)

stimulated a great resurgence of interest in unifying general relativity and
quantum mechanics. Amongst a number of appealing features of this approach are
the intuitive picture of quantum geometry using spin networks and powerful
mathematical tools from gauge field theory. However, the present form of loop
quantum gravity suffers from a quantum ambiguity, due to the presence of a free
(Barbero-Immirzi) parameter. Following recent progress on the conformal
decomposition of gravitational fields, we present a new phase space for general
relativity. In addition to spin-gauge symmetry, the new phase space also
incorporates conformal symmetry making the description parameter free. The
Barbero-Immirzi ambiguity is shown to occur only if the conformal symmetry is
gauge-fixed prior to quantization. By withholding its full symmetries, the new
phase space offers a promising platform for the future development of loop
quantum gravity. This paper aims to provide an exposition, at a reduced
technical level, of the above theoretical advances and their background
developments. Further details are referred to cited references.

introduced. They can make up a more general family of multiqubit states, the
GHZ-W-type states, which is a useful kind of entanglement for quantum
teleporatation and error correction. We completely characterize the property of
this type of states, and mainly classify the GHZ-type states and the W-type

Many concrete examples are given to exhibit how our method is used for the

  all-electrical, molecule-mesoscopic interface</title><description>  The challenge of building a scalable quantum processor requires consolidation
of the conflicting requirements of achieving coherent control and preservation
of quantum coherence in a large scale quantum system. Moreover, the system
should be compatible with miniaturization and integration of quantum circuits.
Mesoscopic solid state systems such as superconducting islands and quantum dots
feature robust control techniques using local electrical signals and
self-evident scaling based on advances in fabrication; however, in general the
quantum states of solid state devices tend to decohere rapidly. In contrast,
quantum optical systems based on trapped ions and neutral atoms exhibit
dramatically better coherence properties, while miniaturization of atomic and
molecular systems, and their integration with mesoscopic electrical circuits,
remains an important challenge. Below we describe methods for the integration
of a single particle system -- an isolated polar molecule -- with mesoscopic
solid state devices in a way that produces robust, coherent, quantum-level
control. The methods described include the trapping, cooling, detection,
coherent manipulation and quantum coupling of isolated polar molecules at
sub-micron dimensions near cryogenic stripline microwave resonators. We show
that electrostatically trapped polar molecules can exhibit strong confinement
and fast, purely electrical gate control. Furthermore, the effect of electrical
noise sources, a key issue in quantum information processing, can be suppressed
to very low levels via appropriate preparation and manipulation of the polar
molecules. Our setup provides a scalable cavity QED-type quantum computer
architecture, where entanglement of distant qubits stored in long-lived
rotational molecular states is achieved via exchange of microwave photons.

a natural example. In the ion's ground state the Mn core spin magnetic moment
locks antiparallel to the spin and orbital magnetic moment of a bound valence
hole from the GaAs host. Direct electrical manipulation of the ion spin is
possible because electric fields manipulate the orbital wave function of the
hole, and through the spin-orbit coupling the spin is reoriented as well.
Coupling two or more ion spins can be achieved using electrical gates to

controlled coupling of ionic spins via electrical gates alone may find

defined, and their properties given. The wavelets are 2-D generalizations of
1-D analytic wavelets, developed from the Generalized Cauchy-Riemann equations
and represented as quaternionic functions. Higher dimensionality complicates
the issue of analyticity, more than one `analytic' extension of a real function
is possible, and an `analytic' analysis wavelet will not necessarily construct
`analytic' decomposition coefficients. The decomposition of locally
unidirectional and/or separable variation is investigated in detail, and two
distinct families of hyperanalytic wavelet coefficients are introduced, the
monogenic and the hypercomplex wavelet coefficients. The recasting of the
analysis in a different frame of reference and its effect on the constructed
coefficients is investigated, important issues for sampled transform
coefficients. The magnitudes of the coefficients are shown to exhibit stability
with respect to shifts in phase. Hyperanalytic 2-D wavelet coefficients enable
the retrieval of a phase-and-magnitude description of an image in phase space,
similarly to the description of a 1-D signal with the use of 1-D analytic
wavelets, especially appropriate for oscillatory signals. Existing 2-D
directional wavelet decompositions are related to the newly developed

strong qubit--coupler interaction. The third junction gives the coupler a
nontrivial current--flux relation; its derivative (i.e., the susceptibility)
determines the coupling strength J, which thus is tunable in situ via the
coupler's flux bias. In the qubit regime, J was varied from ~45

an intermediate coupler bias. Measurements on a second sample illuminate the

correlations P_ABE, shared between two honest parties and an eavesdropper. The
most studied distillation scenario consists of joint operations on a large
number of copies of the distribution (P_ABE)^N, assisted with public
communication. Here we consider distillation with only one copy of the
distribution, and instead of rates, the 'quality' of the distilled secret bits
is optimized, where the 'quality' is quantified by the secret-bit fraction of
the result. The secret-bit fraction of a binary distribution is the proportion
which constitutes a secret bit between Alice and Bob. With local operations and
public communication the maximal extractable secret-bit fraction from a
distribution P_ABE is found, and is denoted by Lambda[P_ABE]. This quantity is
shown to be nonincreasing under local operations and public communication, and
nondecreasing under eavesdropper's local operations: it is a secrecy monotone.
It is shown that if Lambda[P_ABE]&gt;1/2 then P_ABE is distillable, thus providing
a sufficient condition for distillability. A simple expression for
Lambda[P_ABE] is found when the eavesdropper is decoupled, and when the honest
parties' information is binary and the local operations are reversible.
Intriguingly, for general distributions the (optimal) operation requires local
degradation of the data.

are due to reflections and time delays. Reflections can be made exponentially
small for devices that are large in comparison with the wavelength of light.
Time delays are unavoidable and will result in wave-front dislocations. This

paper shows that the time delays do not depend on the directions and impact
parameters of incident light rays, although the refractive-index profile of any
conformal invisibility device is necessarily asymmetric. The distortions of
images are thus uniform, which reduces the risk of detection. The paper also

power definitely requires a deep understanding of the mechanism of quantum loop

describe its computational process. The notions of termination and almost
termination are proposed for quantum loops, and the function computed by a
quantum loop is defined. To show their expressive power, quantum loops are
applied in describing quantum walks. Necessary and sufficient conditions for
termination and almost termination of a general quantum loop on any mixed input
state are presented. A quantum loop is said to be (almost) terminating if it
(almost) terminates on any input state. We show that a quantum loop is almost
terminating if and only if it is uniformly almost terminating. It is observed
that a small disturbance either on the unitary transformation in the loop body
or on the measurement in the loop guard can make any quantum loop (almost)
terminating. Moreover, a representation of the function computed by a quantum

polarization encoded version of the B92 protocol. The system employs
vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers with emission wavelengths of 850 nm as
weak coherent light sources, and silicon single photon avalanche diodes as the
single photon detectors. A distributed feedback laser of emission wavelength
1.3 micro-metres, and a linear gain germanium avalanche photodiode was used to
optically synchronize individual photons over the standard telecommunications
fiber. The quantum key distribution system exhibited a quantum bit error rate
of 1.4%, and an estimated net bit rate greater than 100,000 bits-per-second for
a 4.2 km transmission range. For a 10 km fiber range a quantum bit error rate
of 2.1%, and estimated net bit rate of greater than 7,000 bits-per-second was
achieved.

error correction codes capable of correcting a single error per error
correction cycle. Yet, time-correlated error are common for physical
implementations of quantum systems; an error corrected during the previous
cycle may reoccur later due to physical processes specific for each physical

for a restricted class of time-correlated errors in a spin-boson model. The

The basic principle behind this scheme is the fact that each mode of the
squeezed field by itself does not contain any information regarding the
squeezing phase. The squeezing phase can only be obtained through a joint
measurement of the two modes. This, combined with the fact that it is possible
to perform remote squeezing measurements, makes it possible to implement a

mechanics alone are generally held to be impossible. In this paper we give a
strengthened and explicit proof of this result. We extend its scope to a much
larger variety of protocols, which may have an arbitrary number of rounds, in
which both classical and quantum information is exchanged, and which may
include aborts and resets. Moreover, we do not consider the receiver to be
bound to a fixed &quot;honest&quot; strategy, so that &quot;anonymous state protocols&quot;, which
were recently suggested as a possible way to beat the known no-go results are
also covered. We show that any concealing protocol allows the sender to find a
cheating strategy, which is universal in the sense that it works against any
strategy of the receiver. Moreover, if the concealing property holds only
approximately, the cheat goes undetected with a high probability, which we
explicitly estimate. The proof uses an explicit formalization of general two
party protocols, which is applicable to more general situations, and a new
estimate about the continuity of the Stinespring dilation of a general quantum
channel. The result also provides a natural characterization of protocols that
fall outside the standard setting of unlimited available technology, and thus
may allow secure bit commitment. We present a new such protocol whose security,
perhaps surprisingly, relies on decoherence in the receiver's lab.

light that allows for a simple characterization of these quantum states. The
usual detection scheme, based on heterodyne measurements, requires the use of a
local oscillator with a frequency equal to the mean of the frequencies of the
two modes of the squeezed field. As a result, unless the two modes are close in
frequency, a high-frequency shot-noise-limited detection system is needed. We
propose the use of a bichromatic field as the local oscillator in the
heterodyne measurements. By the proper selection of the frequencies of the
bichromatic field, it is possible to arbitrarily select the frequency around
which the squeezing information is located, thus making it possible to use a
low-bandwidth detection system and to move away from any excess noise present

obtained by tracing over one of the two parts. Critical ground states of local
Hamiltonians in one dimension have entanglement that diverges logarithmically

proportional to the size of the $AB$ boundary, there is generically a universal
logarithmically divergent correction. This logarithmic term is completely

way that after some decoherence occurs, most of the information can be restored
by a suitable decoding operation. For this purpose, we incorporate redundancy
by mapping a given initial quantum state to a messenger state on a
larger-dimensional Hilbert space via a $C^*$-algebra embedding. Our noise model
for the transmission is a phase damping channel which admits a noiseless or
decoherence-free subspace or subsystem. More precisely, the transmission
channel is obtained from convex combinations of a set of lowest rank yes/no
measurements that leave a component of the messenger state unchanged. The
objective of our encoding is to distribute quantum information optimally across
the noise-susceptible component of the transmission when the noiseless
component is not large enough to contain all the quantum information to be
transmitted. We derive simple geometric conditions for optimal encoding and
construct examples.

random process leading to a stochastic temporal evolution of a closed quantum

quantum system to its macroscopic environment. We derive deterministic master
equations describing the average evolution of the quantum system under
classical continuous-time Markovian noise and two sets of master equations
under quantum noise. Strikingly, these three equations of motion are shown to
be equivalent in the case of classical random telegraph noise and proper
quantum environments. Hence fully quantum-mechanical models within the Born

Furthermore, we apply the derived equations together with pulse optimization
techniques to achieve high-fidelity one-qubit operations under random telegraph
noise, and hence fight decoherence in these systems of great practical

in a trap and show that coherent manipulations of the atomic ensemble, such as
adiabatic passage, are feasible if performed within the coherence time window
dictated by the temperature, which is relatively long for cold atoms. We show
that a sequence of ~2*10^7 pulses of moderate intensities, each lasting ~750
ns, can photoassociate a large fraction of the atomic ensemble at temperature
of 100 microkelvin and density of 10^{11} atoms/cm^3. Use of multiple pulse
sequences makes it possible to populate the ground vibrational state. Employing
spontaneous decay from a selected excited state, one can accumulate the
molecules in a narrow distribution of vibrational states in the ground
electronic potential. Alternatively, by removing the created molecules from the
beam path between pulse sets, one can create a low-density ensemble of
molecules in their ground ro-vibrational state.

encoding quantum information by multiphoton states, and elaborating it via
ancillary extensions, linear optical passive devices and photodetection. Our
scheme stems in a natural way from the mathematical structures underlying the
physics of linear optical passive devices. In particular, we analyze an
economical procedure for mapping a fiducial 2-photon 2-mode state into an
arbitrary 2-photon 2-mode state using ancillary resources and linear optical
passive N-ports assisted by post-selection. We found that adding a single
ancilla mode is enough to generate any desired target state. The effect of
imperfect photodetection in post-selection is considered and a simple trade-off

information theory. The Werner state is recognized as a rational solution of
the Yang--Baxter equation, and the isotropic state with an adjustable parameter
is found to form a braid representation. The set of permutation's partial
transposes is an algebra called the &quot;PPT&quot; algebra which guides the construction
of multipartite symmetric states. The virtual knot theory having permutation as
a virtual crossing provides a topological language describing quantum
computation having permutation as a swap gate. In this paper, permutation's
partial transpose is identified with an idempotent of the Temperley--Lieb
algebra. The algebra generated by permutation and its partial transpose is
found to be the Brauer algebra. The linear combinations of identity,
permutation and its partial transpose can form various projectors describing
tangles; braid representations; virtual braid representations underlying common
solutions of the braid relation and Yang--Baxter equations; and virtual
Temperley--Lieb algebra which is articulated from the graphical viewpoint. They
lead to our drawing a picture called the &quot;ABPK&quot; diagram describing knot theory
in terms of its corresponding algebra, braid group and polynomial invariant.
The paper also identifies nontrivial unitary braid representations with
universal quantum gates, and derives a Hamiltonian to determine the evolution
of a universal quantum gate, and further computes the Markov trace in terms of
a universal quantum gate for a link invariant to detect linking numbers.

  box</title><description>  Wave mechanics of a particle in 1-D box (size $= d$) is critically analyzed
to reveal its untouched aspects. When the particle rests in its ground state,
its zero-point force ($F_o$) produces non-zero strain by modifying the box size
from $d$ to $d' = d + \Delta d$ in all practical situations where the force
($F_a$) restoring $d$ is not infinitely strong. Assuming that $F_a$ originates
from a potential $\propto x^2$ ($x$ being a small change in $d$), we find that:
(i) the particle and strained box assume a mutually bound state (under the
equilibrium between $F_o$ and $F_a$) with binding energy $\Delta{E} =
-\epsilon_o'\Delta{d}/d'$ (with $\epsilon_o' = h^2/8md'^2$ being the ground
state energy of the particle in the strained box), (ii) the box size oscillates
around $d'$ when the said equilibrium is disturbed, (iii) an exchange of energy
between the particle and the strained box occurs during such oscillations, and
(iv) the particle, having collisional motion in its excited states, assumes
collisionless motion in its ground state. These aspects have desired
experimental support and proven relevance for understanding the physics of
widely different systems such as quantum dots, quantum wires, trapped single
particle/ion, clusters of particles, superconductors, superfluids, {\it etc.}
It is emphasized that the physics of such a system in its low energy states can
be truly revealed if the theory incorporates $F_o$ and related aspects.

the decoherence process induced by a broadband thermal field. We showed that in
a single atom there is no perfect CPT when the atomic transitions are affected
by the thermal field. The perfect CPT may occur when only one of the two atomic
transitions is affected by the thermal field. In the case when both atomic
transitions are affected by the thermal field, we demonstrated that regardless
of the intensity of the thermal field the destructive effect on the CPT can be
circumvented by the collective behavior of the atoms. An analytic expression
was obtained for the populations of the upper atomic levels which can be
considered as a measure of the level of thermal decoherence. The results show
that the collective interaction between the atoms can significantly enhance the
population trapping in that the population of the upper state decreases with
increased number of atoms. The physical origin of this feature was explained by
the semiclassical dressed atom model of the system. We introduced the concept
of multiatom collective coherent population trapping by demonstrating the
existence of collective (entangled) states whose storage capacity is larger
than that of the equivalent states of independent atoms.

algorithms. These all follow unitary quantum evolution, apart from the final
measurement. Since logical qubits in a quantum computer must be protected from
decoherence by error correction, there is no need to consider decoherence at
the level of algorithms. Nonetheless, enlarging the range of quantum dynamics
to include non-unitary evolution provides a wider range of possibilities for
tuning the properties of quantum walks. For example, small amounts of
decoherence in a quantum walk on the line can produce more uniform spreading (a
top-hat distribution), without losing the quantum speed up. This paper reviews
the work on decoherence, and more generally on non-unitary evolution, in
quantum walks and suggests what future questions might prove interesting to

entanglement between two separated degrees of freedom (ij) and the rest of
system, near a quantum phase transition. Away from the critical point, S(i,j)
saturates with a characteristic length scale $\xi_E$, as the distance |i-j|
increases. The entanglement length $\xi_E$ agrees with the correlation length.
The universality and finite size scaling of entanglement are demonstrated in a
class of exactly solvable one dimensional spin model. By connecting the
two-point entanglement to correlation functions in the long range limit, we
argue that the prediction power of a two-point entanglement is universal as
long as the two involved points are separated far enough.

hole can be represented by a maximally entangled two-mode squeezed state of
collapsing matter and infalling Hawking radiation. The final boundary condition
at the singularity is then described by the random unitary transformation
acting on the collapsing matter field. The outgoing Hawking radiation is
obtained by the final state projection on the total wave function, which looks
like a quantum teleportation process without the classical information
transmitted. The black hole evaporation process as seen by the observer outside
the black hole is now a unitary process but non-local physics is required to
transmit the information outside the black hole. It is also shown that the
final state projection by the evaporation process is strongly affected by the
quantum state outside the event horizon, which clearly violates the locality
principle.

non-adjacent) interval of spins in an arbitrary pure finitely correlated state
(FCS) on a chain of spins of any magnitude. Finitely correlated states are
otherwise known as matrix product states or generalized valence-bond states.
The bounds become exact in the limit of the entanglement of a single spin and
the half-infinite chain to the right (or the left) of it. Our bounds provide a
proof of the recent conjecture by Benatti, Hiesmayr, and Narnhofer that their
necessary condition for non-vanishing entanglement in terms of a single spin
and the ``memory'' of the FCS, is also sufficient . Our result also generalizes
the study of entanglement in the ground state of the AKLT model by Fan,
Korepin, and Roychowdhury. Our result permits one to calculate more
efficiently, numerically and in some cases even analytically, the entanglement
of arbitrary finitely correlated quantum spin chains.

as those consisting of small numbers of atoms and photons--is a delicate
business. The fundamental uncertainty that is inherently present at this scale
manifests itself in the unavoidable presence of noise, making this a novel
field of application for stochastic estimation and control theory. In this
expository paper we demonstrate estimation and feedback control of quantum
mechanical systems in what is essentially a noncommutative version of the
binomial model that is popular in mathematical finance. The model is extremely
rich and allows a full development of the theory, while remaining completely
within the setting of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces (thus avoiding the
technical complications of the continuous theory). We introduce discretized
models of an atom in interaction with the electromagnetic field, obtain
filtering equations for photon counting and homodyne detection, and solve a
stochastic control problem using dynamic programming and Lyapunov function
methods.

  J-matrix method</title><description>  In three dimensional scattering, the energy continuum wavefunction is
obtained by utilizing two independent solutions of the reference wave equation.
One of them is typically singular (usually, near the origin of configuration
space). Both are asymptotically regular and sinusoidal with a phase difference
(shift) that contains information about the scattering potential. Therefore,
both solutions are essential for scattering calculations. Various
regularization techniques were developed to handle the singular solution
leading to different well-established scattering methods. To simplify the
calculation the regularized solutions are usually constructed in a space that
diagonalizes the reference Hamiltonian. In this work, we start by proposing
solutions that are already regular. We write them as infinite series of square
integrable basis functions that are compatible with the domain of the reference
Hamiltonian. However, we relax the diagonal constraint on the representation by
requiring that the basis supports an infinite tridiagonal matrix representation
of the wave operator. The hope is that by relaxing this constraint on the
solution space a larger freedom is achieved in regularization such that a
natural choice emerges as a result. We find that one of the resulting two
independent wavefunctions is, in fact, the regular solution of the reference
problem. The other is uniquely regularized in the sense that it solves the
reference wave equation only outside a dense region covering the singularity in
configuration space. However, asymptotically it is identical to the irregular
solution. We show that this natural and special regularization is equivalent to
that already used in the J-matrix method of scattering.

information processing systems. Most QEC efforts focus on extending classical
error correction schemes to the quantum regime. The input to a noisy system is
embedded in a coded subspace, and error recovery is performed via an operation
designed to perfectly correct for a set of errors, presumably a large subset of
the physical noise process. In this paper, we examine the choice of recovery
operation. Rather than seeking perfect correction on a subset of errors, we
seek a recovery operation to maximize the entanglement fidelity for a given
input state and noise model. In this way, the recovery operation is optimum for
the given encoding and noise process. This optimization is shown to be
calculable via a semidefinite program (SDP), a well-established form of convex
optimization with efficient algorithms for its solution. The error recovery
operation may also be interpreted as a combining operation following a quantum
spreading channel, thus providing a quantum analogy to the classical diversity
combining operation.

study the geometric phase in the nonunitary regime, particularly important for

of Physics, the famous paper of Lucien Hardy's, Quantum Theory from Five
Reasonable Axioms, is not relevant. The present paper argues that Hardy does
not give a physical definition of `limit', and if we assume the usual
mathematical definition of limit of a sequence, he fails to define a sequence
in physical terms to which the usual definition is applicable. We argue that
one should not, in fact, try to define probability in terms of the usual notion
of limit of a sequence of results of a measurement because of seemingly
insurmountable difficulties in axiomatising the notion of function or sequence
in this context. Von Plato's and the authour's work (see

  Microresonator</title><description>  Over the past decade, strong interactions of light and matter at the
single-photon level have enabled a wide set of scientific advances in quantum
optics and quantum information science. This work has been performed
principally within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics with diverse
physical systems, including single atoms in Fabry-Perot resonators, quantum
dots coupled to micropillars and photonic bandgap cavities, and Cooper-pairs
interacting with superconducting resonators. Experiments with single, localized
atoms have been at the forefront of these advances with the use of optical
resonators in high-finesse Fabry-Perot configurations. As a result of the
extreme technical challenges involved in further improving the multilayer
dielectric mirror coatings of these resonators and in scaling to large numbers
of devices, there has been increased interest in the development of alternative
microcavity systems. Here we show strong coupling between individual Cesium
atoms and the fields of a high-quality toroidal microresonator. From
observations of transit events for single atoms falling through the resonator's
evanescent field, we determine the coherent coupling rate for interactions near
the surface of the resonator. We develop a theoretical model to quantify our
observations, demonstrating that strong coupling is achieved, with the rate of
coherent coupling exceeding the dissipative rates of the atom and the cavity.
Our work opens the way for investigations of optical processes with single
atoms and photons in lithographically fabricated microresonators. Applications
include the implementation of quantum networks, scalable quantum logic with
photons, and quantum information processing on atom chips.

the amount of information that a player can obtain about his opponent and a
maximum or minimum entropy criterion. The natural trend of a physical system is
to its maximum entropy state. The minimum entropy state is a characteristic of
a manipulated system i.e. externally controlled or imposed. There exist tacit
rules inside a system that do not need to be specified or clarified and search
the system equilibrium under the collective welfare principle. The other rules
are imposed over the system when one or many of its members violate this
principle and maximize its individual welfare at the expense of the group.

partial differential equations (PDEs) for appropriate coarse-grained quantities
(e.g. concentrations). The derivation of accurate such PDEs starting from finer
scale, atomistic models, and using suitable averaging, is often a challenging
task; approximate PDEs are typically obtained through mathematical closure
procedures (e.g. mean-field approximations). In this paper, we show how such
approximate macroscopic PDEs can be exploited in constructing preconditioners
to accelerate stochastic simulations for spatially distributed particle-based
process models. We illustrate how such preconditioning can improve the
convergence of equation-free coarse-grained methods based on coarse
timesteppers. Our model problem is a stochastic reaction-diffusion model
capable of exhibiting Turing instabilities.

arbitrary $2^\nb$ unitary matrix acting on $\nb$ qubits, into a sequence of
elementary operations (SEO). There are many possible ways of decomposing a
unitary matrix into a SEO, and some of these decompositions have shorter length
(are more efficient) than others. Finding an optimum (shortest) decomposition
is a very hard task, and is not our intention here. A less ambitious, more
doable task is to find methods for optimizing small segments of a SEO. Call
these methods piecewise optimizations. Piecewise optimizations involve
replacing a small quantum circuit by an equivalent one with fewer CNOTs. Two
circuits are said to be equivalent if one of them multiplied by some external
local operations equals the other. This equivalence relation between circuits
has its own class functions, which we call circuit invariants. Dressed CNOTs
are a simple yet very useful generalization of standard CNOTs. After discussing
circuit invariants and dressed CNOTs, we give some methods for simplifying
2-qubit and 3-qubit circuits. We include with this paper software (written in
Octave/Matlab) that checks many of the algorithms proposed in the paper.

one-dimensional projectors on a Hilbert space H and make no reference to a
probabilistic phase space or quantum system. They only ask for an assignment of
zero or one to every projector such that the assignment respects orthogonal
resolutions of the identity. Various no-go results in the literature show that
the pair of statements {BKS is valid; dim H greater than or equal to 3} are
inconsistent. Here we show, more radically, that the pair actually contradicts
the dimensionality of the space itself, by implying that there can exist at

only elementary inner product spaces. It is non-probabilistic, inequality-free,
state independent, does not use entanglement, and is simultaneously valid in
all dimensions three or greater.

being of a higher dimension then the latter. The proposed measure has the
advantage of dealing with possibly correlated inputs, but at the expense of
working on the whole space and not just the information bearing part as is
usually the case, i.e., no partial trace operation is explicitly involved. It
is also shown that the distance measure and an average measure of channel

  in Brain Dynamics</title><description>  With an increasing amount of experimental evidence pouring in from
neurobiological investigations, it is quite appropriate to study viable
reductionist models which may explain some of the features of brain activities.
It is now quite well known that the Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) Model has been quite
successful in explaining the neural phenomena. The idea of circuit equivalents
and the membrane voltages corresponding to neurons have been remarkable which
is essentially a classical result. In view of some recent results which show
that quantum mechanics may be important at suitable length scales inside the
brain, the question which becomes quite important is to find out a proper
quantum analogue of the HH scheme which will reduce to the well known HH model
in a suitable limit. From the ideas of neuro-manifold and the relevance of
quantum mechanics at some length scales in the ion channels, we investigate
this situation in this paper by taking into consideration the Schr\&quot;odinger
equation in an arbitrary manifold with a metric, which is in some sense a
special case of the heat kernel equation. The next important approach we have
taken in order to bring about it's relevance in brain studies and to make
connection with HH models is to find out a plausible circuit equivalents of it.
What we do realize is that for a proper quantum mechanical description and it's
circuit implementation of the same we need to incorporate the non commutativity
inside the circuit model. It has been realized here that the metric is a
dynamical entity governing space time and for considering equivalent circuits
it plays a very distinct role. We have used the methods of stochastic
quantization and have constructed a specific case here and see that HH model
inductances gets renormalized in the quantum limit.

computation using less space resources than classical algorithms. In this
paper, we study, for the first time explicitly, space-bounded quantum
algorithms for computational problems where the input is given not as a whole,
but bit by bit. We show that there exist such problems that a quantum computer
can solve using exponentially less work space than a classical computer. More
precisely, we introduce a very natural and simple model of a space-bounded
quantum online machine and prove an exponential separation of classical and
quantum online space complexity, in the bounded-error setting and for a total
language. The language we consider is inspired by a communication problem (the
set intersection function) that Buhrman, Cleve and Wigderson used to show an
almost quadratic separation of quantum and classical bounded-error
communication complexity. We prove that, in the framework of online space
complexity, the separation becomes exponential.

results are contrasted with the underlying classical dynamics, obtained from
the semiclassical limit of the core-electron collision. Our findings indicate
that entanglement is not simply correlated with the degree of classical chaos,
but rather depends on the specific phase-space features that give rise to
inelastic scattering. Hence mixed phase-space or even regular classical

quant-ph/0602151, quant-ph/0602161). It is explicitly shown that the positive
semi-definite norm associated with the derived inner product for real KG fields
measures the number of active positive and negative energy Fourier modes of the
real KG field on the relativistic mass shell. The very existence of an inner
product with positive semi-definite norm for the considered real, i.e. neutral,
KG fields shows that the metric operator entering the inner product does not
contain the charge-conjugation operator. This observation sheds some additional

implicit constants depend on the given generators. The existing algorithms
solve the problem but they need a very slow and space consuming preparatory

the CHSH inequality, unlike the original Bell inequality, be derived without
making a hidden-variables (or equivalent counter-factual definiteness)

vertex from a given starting vertex. The hitting time for a classical random
walk on a connected graph will always be finite. We show that, by contrast,
quantum walks can have infinite hitting times for some initial states. We seek
criteria to determine if a given walk on a graph will have infinite hitting
times, and find a sufficient condition, which for discrete time quantum walks
is that the degeneracy of the evolution operator be greater than the degree of
the graph. The set of initial states which give an infinite hitting time form a
subspace. The phenomenon of infinite hitting times is in general a consequence
of the symmetry of the graph and its automorphism group. Using the irreducible
representations of the automorphism group, we derive conditions such that
quantum walks defined on this graph must have infinite hitting times for some
initial states. In the case of the discrete walk, if this condition is
satisfied the walk will have infinite hitting times for any choice of a coin
operator, and we give a class of graphs with infinite hitting times for any
choice of coin. Hitting times are not very well-defined for continuous time
quantum walks, but we show that the idea of infinite hitting-time walks
naturally extends to the continuous time case as well.

on the entanglement properties of the S=1/2 antiferromagnetic linear chain
tetramer compound NaCuAsO_{4}. The entanglement gap temperature, T_{E}, is
found to have a non-monotonic dependence on the value of $\alpha$, the exchange
coupling inhomogeneity parameter. We next determine the variation of T_{E} as a
function of S for a spin dimer, a trimer and a tetrahedron. The temperature
T_{E} is found to increase as a function of S, but the scaled entanglement gap
temperature t_{E} goes to zero as S becomes large. Lastly, we study a spin-1
dimer compound to illustrate the quantum complementarity relation. We show that
in the experimentally realizable parameter region, magnetization and
entanglement plateaus appear simultaneously at low temperatures as a function
of the magnetic field. Also, the sharp increase in one quantity as a function
of the magnetic field is accompanied by a sharp decrease in the other so that
the quantum complementarity relation is not violated.

such systems as quantum computing devices. Substantial progress to overcome
these problems has been achieved with cold atoms in optical lattices, where a
detailed control of collective properties is feasible but it is very difficult

polaritons, combined atom and photon excitations, in an array of cavities such

interacting many body system, where individual particles can be controlled and
measured. All individual building blocks of the proposed setting have already
been experimentally realised, thus demonstrating the potential of this device
as a quantum simulator. With the possibility to create attractive on-site
potentials the scheme allows for the creation of highly entangled states and a
phase with particles much more delocalised than in superfluids.

initial conditions. The absence of this property in quantum systems has lead to
a number of proposals for perturbation-based characterizations of quantum
chaos, including linear growth of entropy, exponential decay of fidelity, and
hypersensitivity to perturbation. All of these accurately predict chaos in the
classical limit, but it is not clear that they behave the same far from the
classical realm. We investigate the dynamics of a family of quantizations of
the baker's map, which range from a highly entangling unitary transformation to
an essentially trivial shift map. Linear entropy growth and fidelity decay are
exhibited by this entire family of maps, but hypersensitivity distinguishes
between the simple dynamics of the trivial shift map and the more complicated
dynamics of the other quantizations. This conclusion is supported by an
analytical argument for short times and numerical evidence at later times.

minimum is taken over all possible pure inputs. This problem is cast as a
max-min optimization problem with a rank constraint on an appropriately defined
matrix variable. The problem is computationally very hard because it is
non-convex with respect to both the objective function (output purity) and the
rank constraint. Despite this difficulty, we provide a tractable computational
algorithm that produces the exact optimal solution for codespace of dimension
two. Moreover, this algorithm is easily extended to cover the general class of
codespaces, in which case the solution is suboptimal in the sense that the
suboptimized output purity serves as a lower bound of the exact optimal purity.
The algorithm consists of a sequence of semidefinite programmings and can be

both the molecules and atoms are simulated from first principles in three
dimensions using the positive-P representation method. This allows us to
provide an exact treatment of the molecular field depletion and s-wave
scattering interactions between the particles, as well as to extend the
analysis to nonuniform systems. In the simplest uniform case, we find that the
major source of atom-atom decorrelation is atom-atom recombination which
produces molecules outside the initially occupied condensate mode. The unwanted
molecules are formed from dissociated atom pairs with non-opposite momenta. The
net effect of this process -- which becomes increasingly significant for
dissociation durations corresponding to more than about 40% conversion -- is to
reduce the atom-atom correlations. In addition, for nonuniform systems we find
that mode-mixing due to inhomogeneity can result in further degradation of the
correlation signal. We characterize the correlation strength via the degree of
squeezing of particle number-difference fluctuations in a certain
momentum-space volume and show that the correlation strength can be increased
if the signals are binned into larger counting volumes.

Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. In this interferometer, the simple picture of
two-path interference cannot be applied. We introduce a nearby quantum point
contact to detect the electron in a quantum dot inserted in the interferometer.
We found that charge detection reduces but does not completely suppress the
interference even in the limit of perfect detection. We attribute this
phenomenon to the unique nature of the closed-loop interferometer. That is, the
closed-loop interferometer cannot be simply regarded as a two-path
interferometer because of multiple reflections of electrons. As a result, there
exist indistinguishable paths of the electron in the interferometer and the
interference survives even in the limit of perfect charge detection. This
implies that charge detection is not equivalent to path detection in a
closed-loop interferometer. We also discuss the phase rigidity of the
transmission probability for a two-terminal conductor in the presence of a
detector.

account of the relative efficiencies of the four channels. For this purpose, we
use the fair sampling assumption, and assume explicitly that the detection
efficiencies for the pairs of entangled photons can be written as a product of
the two corresponding detection efficiencies for the single photons. We show
that this explicit use of fair sampling cannot be maintained to be a reasonable
assumption as it leads to an apparent violation of the no-signalling principle.

algebra, in 5-dimensional spacetime. The choice of this space is given the
character of first principle, justified solely by the consequences that can be
derived from such choice and their consistency with experimental results. Given
a metric space of any dimension, one can define monogenic functions, the
natural extension of analytic functions to higher dimensions; such functions
have null vector derivative and have previously been shown by other authors to
play a decisive role in lower dimensional spaces. All monogenic functions have
null Laplacian by consequence; in an hyperbolic space this fact leads
inevitably to a wave equation with plane-like solutions. This is also true for
5-dimensional spacetime and we will explore those solutions, establishing a
parallel with the solutions of the Dirac equation. For this purpose we will
invoke the isomorphism between the complex algebra of 4x4 matrices, also known
as Dirac's matrices. There is one problem with this isomorphism, because the
solutions to Dirac's equation are usually known as spinors (column matrices)
that don't belong to the 4x4 matrix algebra and as such are excluded from the
isomorphism. We will show that a solution in terms of Dirac spinors is
equivalent to a plane wave solution. Just as one finds in the standard
formulation, monogenic functions can be naturally split into positive/negative
energy together with left/right ones. This split is provided by geometric
projectors and we will show that there is a second set of projectors providing
an alternate 4-fold split. The possible implications of this alternate split
are not yet fully understood and are presently the subject of profound
research.

&quot;check&quot; measurements on the system. In general, this problem is NP-hard.
However, we demonstrate that for concatenated block codes, the optimal decoding
can be efficiently computed using a message passing algorithm. We compare the
performance of the message passing algorithm to that of the widespread
blockwise hard decoding technique. Our Monte Carlo results using the 5 qubit

of the message passing algorithms in two respects. 1) Optimal decoding
increases by as much as 94% the error threshold below which the error
correction procedure can be used to reliably send information over a noisy
channel. 2) For noise levels below these thresholds, the probability of error
after optimal decoding is suppressed at a significantly higher rate, leading to
a substantial reduction of the error correction overhead.

Aharonov and Susskind [Phys. Rev. 155, 1428 (1967)], explicitly violates the
commonly-accepted superselection rule that forbids coherent superpositions of
eigenstates of differing atom number. This interference experiment makes use of
a Bose-Einstein condensate as a reference frame with which to perform the
coherent operations analogous to Ramsey pulses. We also investigate an
analogous gedanken experiment to exhibit a coherent superposition of a single
boson and a fermion, violating the commonly-accepted superselection rule
forbidding coherent superpositions of states of differing particle statistics;
in this case, the reference frame is realized by a multi-mode state of many
fermions. This latter case reproduces all of the relevant features of Ramsey
interferometry, including Ramsey fringes over many repetitions of the
experiment. However, the apparent inability of this proposed experiment to
produce well-defined relative phases between two distinct systems each
described by a coherent superposition of a boson and a fermion demonstrates
that there are additional, outstanding requirements to fully ``lift'' the

quantum interference. Optical interferometers such as Michaelson interferometer
provide a measure for second-order coherence at one-photon level and
Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer was widely employed to describe two-photon
entanglement and indistinguishability. However, there is not an effective way
for a system of more than two photons. Recently, a new interferometric scheme
was proposed to quantify the degree of multi-photon distinguishability. Here we
report an experiment to implement the scheme for three-photon case. We are able
to generate three photons with different degrees of temporal distinguishability
and demonstrate how to characterize them by the visibility of three-photon
interference. This method of quantitative description of multi-photon
indistinguishability will have practical implications in the implementation of
quantum information protocols.

resonance. In the classical analogue, a spatial-temporal symmetry should be
broken to obtain a net directed current. It was recently discovered that in
quantum resonance the temporal symmetry can be kept, and we prove that breaking
the spatial symmetry is a necessary condition to find this effect.
  Moreover, we show numerically and analytically how the direction of the
motion is dramatically influenced by the strength of the kicking potential and
the value of the period. By increasing the strength of the interaction this
direction changes periodically, providing us with a non-expected source of
current reversals in this quantum model. These reversals depend on the kicking
period also, though this behavior is theoretically more difficult to analyze.
Finally, we generalize the discussion to the case of a non-uniform initial

states are written, in particular for different initial conditions and
different types of damping, including Ohmic, Drude and weak coupling cases,
Agarwal and Weidlich-Haake models. It is shown that the states which remain
pure are the squeezed states with constant in time variances. For pure states,
the generalized nonlinear Schr\&quot; odinger-type equations corresponding to these
master equations are also obtained. Then the condition for purity of states of
a damped harmonic oscillator is considered in the framework of Lindblad theory
for open quantum systems. For a special choice of the environment coefficients,
the correlated coherent states with constant variances and covariance are shown
to be the only states which remain pure all the time during the evolution of
the considered system. In Karrlein-Grabert and Lindblad models, as well as in
the considered particular models, the expressions of the rate of entropy
production is written and it is shown that the states which preserve their
purity in time are also the states which minimize the entropy production and,
therefore, they are the most stable ones under evolution in the presence of the
environment and play an important role in the description of decoherence
phenomenon.

  Microdisk Cavity</title><description>  A quantum master equation model for the interaction between a two-level
system and whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) of a microdisk cavity is presented,
with specific attention paid to current experiments involving a semiconductor
quantum dot (QD) embedded in a fiber-coupled, AlGaAs microdisk cavity. In
standard single mode cavity QED, three important rates characterize the system:
the QD-cavity coupling rate g, the cavity decay rate kappa, and the QD
dephasing rate gamma_perpendicular. A more accurate model of the microdisk
cavity includes two additional features. The first is a second cavity mode that
can couple to the QD, which for an ideal microdisk corresponds to a traveling
wave WGM propagating counter to the first WGM. The second feature is a coupling
between these two traveling wave WGMs, at a rate beta, due to backscattering
caused by surface roughness that is present in fabricated devices. We consider
the transmitted and reflected signals from the cavity for different parameter
regimes of {g,beta,kappa,gamma_perpendicular}. A result of this analysis is
that even in the presence of negligible roughness induced backscattering, a
strongly coupled QD mediates coupling between the traveling wave WGMs,
resulting in an enhanced effective coherent coupling rate g = sqrt(2)*g0
corresponding to that of a standing wave WGM with an electric field maximum at
the position of the QD. In addition, analysis of the second-order correlation
function of the reflected signal from the cavity indicates that regions of
strong photon antibunching or bunching may be present depending upon the
strength of coupling of the QD to each of the cavity modes. Such intensity
correlation information will likely be valuable in interpreting experimental
measurements of a strongly-coupled QD to a bi-modal WGM cavity.

squeezing of atoms in the thin- and thick-lens regimes. It is found that the
near-resonant standing wave focuses the atoms with a reduced background in
comparison with far-detuned light fields. For some parameters, the quantum
atomic distribution shows even better localization than the classical one.
Spontaneous emission effects are included via the technique of quantum Monte

non-adiabatic and spontaneous emission effects limit the achievable minimal

signatures, similar to the classical double-slit. These first-order
interferences, however, vanish for strong light intensities, restricting
potential applications. Here, we show how to overcome these limitations to
quantum interference in strong fields. First, we recover the first-order

suitable frequency dependence. At strong driving, the optical properties for
different spectral bands are distinct, thus extending the set of observables.
We further show that for a two-photon detector as, e.g., in lithography,

models. In this paper, we approach the system as a Wigner Quantum System, not
imposing the canonical commutation relations, but using instead weaker
relations following from the compatibility of Hamilton's equations and the
Heisenberg equations. In such a setting, the quantum system allows solutions in
a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, with a discrete spectrum for all physical

of the Lie superalgebra gl(1|M). Then we study the properties and spectra of
the physical operators in a class of unitary representations of gl(1|M). These
properties are both interesting and intriguing. In particular, we can give a
complete analysis of the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian and of the position and
momentum operators (including multiplicities). We also study probability
distributions of position operators when the quantum system is in a stationary

  cavity arrays</title><description>  As photons do not interact with each other, it is interesting to ask whether
photonic systems can be modified to exhibit the phases characteristic of
strongly coupled many-body systems. We demonstrate how a Mott insulator type of
phase of excitations can arise in an array of coupled electromagnetic cavities,
each of which is coupled resonantly to a {\em single} two level system
(atom/quantum dot/Cooper pair) and can be individually addressed from outside.
In the Mott phase each atom-cavity system has the same integral number of net
polaritonic (atomic plus photonic) excitations with photon blockade providing
the required repulsion between the excitations in each site. Detuning the
atomic and photonic frequencies suppresses this effect and induces a transition
to a photonic superfluid. We also show that for zero detuning, the system can
simulate the dynamics of many body spin systems.

quantum dynamics. Simulations of the processes are performed in a Lindblad
formulation on multilevel quantum systems strongly interacting with the
environment without spontaneous emission. When seeking a high control yield it
is possible to find fields that successfully fight with decoherence while
attaining a good quality yield. When seeking modest control yields, fields can
be found which are optimally shaped to cooperate with decoherence and thereby
drive the dynamics more efficiently. In the latter regime when the control
field and the decoherence strength are both weak, a theoretical foundation is
established to describe how they cooperate with each other. In general, the
results indicate that the population transfer objectives can be effectively met
by appropriately either fighting or cooperating with decoherence.

proven to be optimal when applied to a particular subset of graph states that
are subject to local Z-noise. Such mixed states can be produced by bringing a
system into thermal equilibrium, when it is described by a Hamiltonian which
has a particular graph state as its unique ground state. From this protocol, we
derive the exact value of the critical temperature above which purification is
impossible, as well as the related optimal purification rates. A possible
simulation of graph Hamiltonians is proposed, which requires only bipartite
interactions and local magnetic fields, enabling the tuning of the system

Theory of Scattering and Decay, is based on the Hardy axiom. The Hardy axiom
asserts that the solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation are functionals
over spaces of Hardy functions. The preparation-registration arrow of time
provides the physical justification for the Hardy axiom. In this paper, it is
shown that the Hardy axiom is incorrect, because the solutions of the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation do not act on spaces of Hardy functions. It is also
shown that the derivation of the preparation-registration arrow of time is
flawed. Thus, Hardy functions neither appear when we solve the
Lippmann-Schwinger equation nor they should appear. It is also shown that the
Bohm-Gadella theory does not rest on the same physical principles as quantum

driven by non-selective von Neumann measurements, with or without an additional
tailored electromagnetic field. As an example, a 2-level quantum system
controlled by non-selective quantum measurements is considered. The control
goal is to find optimal system observables such that consecutive non-selective
measurement of these observables transforms the system from a given initial
state into a state which maximizes the expected value of a target operator (the
objective). A complete analytical solution is found including explicit
expressions for the optimal measured observables and for the maximal objective
value given any target operator, any initial system density matrix, and any
number of measurements. As an illustration, upper bounds on measurement-induced
population transfer between the ground and the excited states for any number of

quantum bits (qubits) and maintain control of their key quantum properties of
superposition and entanglement. Typical QIP schemes envisage an array of
physical systems, such as electrons or nuclei, with each system representing a
given qubit. For adequate control, systems must be distinguishable either by
physical separation or unique frequencies, and their mutual interactions must
be individually manipulable. These difficult requirements exclude many
nanoscale technologies where systems are densely packed and continuously
interacting. Here we demonstrate a new paradigm: restricting ourselves to
global control pulses we permit systems to interact freely and continuously,
with the consequence that qubits can become delocalized over the entire device.
We realize this using NMR studies of three carbon-13 nuclei in alanine,
demonstrating all the key aspects including a quantum mirror, one- and
two-qubit gates, permutation of densely packed qubits and Deutsch algorithms.

for any $n$ unknown quantum states in an $m$-dimensional Hilbert space. The
discriminator is a fixed measurement which has two kinds of input registers:
the program registers and the data register. The program registers consist of
the $n$ states, while the data register is prepared among them. The task of the
discriminator is to tell us which state stored in the program registers is
equivalent to that in the data register. First, we give a necessary and
sufficient condition for judging an unambiguous programmable discriminator.
Then, if $m=n$, we present an optimal unambiguous programmable discriminator
for them, in the sense of maximizing the worst-case probability of success.
Finally, we propose a universal unambiguous programmable discriminator for
arbitrary $n$ quantum states. We also show how to use this universal

change the sign of the correlation of the measurement outcomes obtained by two
distant recipients. The two recipients must cooperate if they are to obtain the
sign of the correlation, which is used as a secret key. We show that our scheme
is secure against intercept-and-resend (I-R) and beam splitting attacks by an

attack by one of the recipients can be detected by changing the dimension of
the time bin entanglement randomly and inserting two &quot;vacant&quot; slots between the

in the vacant slots. The proposed scheme has better experimental feasibility
than previously proposed entanglement-based QSS schemes.

on the sole basis of the laws of physics, that is without limiting the
computational power of the eavesdropper. The usual security proofs suppose that
the authorized partners, Alice and Bob, have a perfect knowledge and control of
their quantum systems and devices; for instance, they must be sure that the
logical bits have been encoded in true qubits, and not in higher-dimensional
systems. In this paper, we present an approach that circumvents this strong
assumption. We define protocols, both for the case of bits and for generic
$d$-dimensional outcomes, in which the security is guaranteed by the very
structure of the Alice-Bob correlations, under the no-signalling condition. The
idea is that, if the correlations cannot be produced by shared randomness, then
Eve has poor knowledge of Alice's and Bob's symbols. The present study assumes,
on the one hand that the eavesdropper Eve performs only individual attacks
(this is a limitation to be removed in further work), on the other hand that
Eve can distribute any correlation compatible with the no-signalling condition
(in this sense her power is greater than what quantum physics allows). Under
these assumptions, we prove that the protocols defined here allow extracting
secrecy from noisy correlations, when these correlations violate a Bell-type
inequality by a sufficiently large amount. The region, in which secrecy
extraction is possible, extends within the region of correlations achievable by
measurements on entangled quantum states.

singularity at E=-z^2/4. For \Re(z)&lt;0, H has an eigenvalue at E=-z^2/4. For the

almost uniform sampling} from a state space $S$ of cardinality $N$: run a
symmetric ergodic Markov chain $P$ on $S$ for long enough to obtain a random
state from within $\epsilon$ total variation distance of the uniform
distribution over $S$. The running time of this algorithm, the so-called {\em
mixing time} of $P$, is $O(\delta^{-1} (\log N + \log \epsilon^{-1}))$, where
$\delta$ is the spectral gap of $P$.
  We present a natural quantum version of this algorithm based on repeated
measurements of the {\em quantum walk} $U_t = e^{-iPt}$. We show that it
samples almost uniformly from $S$ with logarithmic dependence on
$\epsilon^{-1}$ just as the classical walk $P$ does; previously, no such
quantum walk algorithm was known. We then outline a framework for analyzing its
running time and formulate two plausible conjectures which together would imply
that it runs in time $O(\delta^{-1/2} \log N \log \epsilon^{-1})$ when $P$ is
the standard transition matrix of a constant-degree graph. We prove each
conjecture for a subclass of Cayley graphs.

Quantum Bayesian equations for the qubit density matrix are derived, and cast

for kicked quantum nondemolition measurements, combined with conditional
unitary operations. These results are applied to derive a feedback protocol to
produce an arbitrary pure state after a weak measurement, as well as to

is developed in the spirit of the classical result from mathematical statistics
due to Le Cam. Roughly speaking, local asymptotic normality means that the
family varphi_{\theta_{0}+ u/\sqrt{n}}^{n} consisting of joint states of n
identically prepared quantum systems approaches in a statistical sense a family
of Gaussian state phi_{u} of an algebra of canonical commutation relations. The
convergence holds for all &quot;local parameters&quot; u\in R^{m} such that
theta=theta_{0}+ u/sqrt{n} parametrizes a neighborhood of a fixed point
theta_{0}\in Theta\subset R^{m}.
  In order to prove the result we define weak and strong convergence of quantum
statistical experiments which extend to the asymptotic framework the notion of
quantum sufficiency introduces by Petz. Along the way we introduce the concept
of canonical state of a statistical experiment, and investigate the relation
between the two notions of convergence. For reader's convenience and
completeness we review the relevant results of the classical as well as the

spatial polygonal sets in $(2+1)$ dimensions contain a term which scales
logarithmically with the cutoff. Its coefficient is a universal quantity
consisting in a sum of contributions from the individual vertices. For a free
scalar field this contribution is given by the trace anomaly in a three
dimensional space with conical singularities located on the boundary of a plane
angular sector. We find its analytic expression as a function of the angle.
This is given in terms of the solution of a set of non linear ordinary
differential equations. For general free fields, we also find the small-angle
limit of the logarithmic coefficient, which is related to the two dimensional
entropic c-functions. The calculation involves a reduction to a two dimensional
problem, and as a byproduct, we obtain the trace of the Green function for a
massive scalar field in a sphere where boundary conditions are specified on a
segment of a great circle. This also gives the exact expression for the
entropies for a scalar field in a two dimensional de Sitter space.

simultaneously accomplishes two goals: quantum communication-assisted
entanglement distillation, and state transfer from the sender to the receiver.
As a result, in addition to her other &quot;children,&quot; the mother protocol generates
the state merging primitive of Horodecki, Oppenheim and Winter, a fully quantum

  We show that this problem is BQP-complete. It can be solved efficiently on a

vector and raising the outcome to the mth power. Conversely, every quantum
circuit that solves a problem in BQP can be encoded into a sparse matrix such
that some basis vector |j&gt; corresponding to the input induces two different
spectral measures depending on whether the input is accepted or not. These
measures can be distinguished by estimating the mth statistical moment for some

  arrays</title><description>  It was recently proposed to use small groups of trapped ions as qubit
carriers in miniaturized electrode arrays that comprise a large number of
individual trapping zones, between which ions could be moved. This approach
might be scalable for quantum information processing with a large numbers of
qubits. Processing of quantum information is achieved by transporting ions to
and from separate memory and qubit manipulation zones in between quantum logic
operations. The transport of ion groups in this scheme plays a major role and
requires precise experimental control and fast transport. In this paper we
introduce a theoretical framework to study ion transport in external potentials
that might be created by typical miniaturized Paul trap electrode arrays. In
particular we discuss the relationship between classical and quantum
descriptions of the transport and study the energy transfer to the oscillatory
motion during near-adiabatic transport. Based on our findings we suggest a
numerical method to find electrode potentials as a function of time to optimize
the local potential an ion experiences during transport. We demonstrate this
method for one specific electrode geometry that should closely represent the
situation encountered in realistic trap arrays.

best quantum mechanical approximation of classical behavior. Here we argue
that, far from being classical, coherent state are in fact highly entangled. We
demonstrate this by showing that a general system of indistinguishable bosons
in a coherent state can be used to entangle, by local interactions, two
spatially separated and distinguishable non-interacting quantum systems.
Entanglement can also be extracted in the same way from number states or any

  subspace-Lanczos algorithm</title><description>  In papers\cite{js,jsa}, the amplitudes of continuous-time quantum walk on
graphs possessing quantum decomposition (QD graphs) have been calculated by a
new method based on spectral distribution associated to their adjacency matrix.
Here in this paper, it is shown that the continuous-time quantum walk on any
arbitrary graph can be investigated by spectral distribution method, simply by
using Krylov subspace-Lanczos algorithm to generate orthonormal bases of
Hilbert space of quantum walk isomorphic to orthogonal polynomials. Also new
type of graphs possessing generalized quantum decomposition have been
introduced, where this is achieved simply by relaxing some of the constrains
imposed on QD graphs and it is shown that both in QD and GQD graphs, the unit
vectors of strata are identical with the orthonormal basis produced by Lanczos
algorithm. Moreover, it is shown that probability amplitude of observing walk
at a given vertex is proportional to its coefficient in the corresponding unit
vector of its stratum, and it can be written in terms of the amplitude of its
stratum. Finally the capability of Lanczos-based algorithm for evaluation of
walk on arbitrary graphs (GQD or non-QD types), has been tested by calculating
the probability amplitudes of quantum walk on some interesting finite
(infinite) graph of GQD type and finite (infinite) path graph of non-GQD type,
where the asymptotic behavior of the probability amplitudes at infinite limit
of number of vertices, are in agreement with those of central limit theorem of

  Electromagnetically Induced Transperancy</title><description>  Dynamic control of a weak quantum probe light pulse for the generation and
quantum manipulations of a stationary multi-color (MC-) light field in a
resonant coherent atomic medium using electromagnetically induced transparency
is proposed. The manipulations have been analyzed based on the analytical
solution of the adiabatic limit in the evolution of MC-light fields resulting
from interaction of the slow probe light with the new fields generated in the
nondegenerate multi-wave mixing scheme. We have found a critical stopping
condition for the MC-light fields where the group velocity of light should
reduce down to zero. Semiclassical dynamics and behavior of specific quantum
correlations of the MC-light fields have been studied in detail for particular
initial quantum states of the probe pulse. The stationary MC-field dynamics are
treated in terms of dark MC-polariton states constructed for the studied
multi-wave mixing processes. We have found the conditions for optimal
manipulation of the MC-light while preserving the delicate quantum correlations
of the initial probe light pulse. The quantum manipulations leading to the
frequency and direction switching of the initial probe light pulse as well as
to the quantum swapping of probe light into the new multi-frequency light
fields have been proposed. The possibilities of the interaction time
lengthening and enhancement of the electric field amplitudes of the stationary
MC-light are also discussed for enhancement of the interactions with weak

We prove that the optimal bound for the accessible information using up to

\right&gt;$ and an associated set of operators $A_\alpha$ which generate
transformations connecting those trial states. Using variational principles, we
show that we can always obtain a quantum Monte-Carlo method where the quantum
evolution of a system is replaced by jumps between density matrices of the form
$D = |Q_a&gt; &lt;Q_b|$, and where the average evolutions of the moments of
$A_\alpha$ up to a given order $k$, i.e. $&lt; A_{\alpha_1} &gt;$,  $&lt; A_{\alpha_1}
A_{\alpha_2} &gt;$,..., $&lt; A_{\alpha_1} ... A_{\alpha_k} &gt;$, are constrained to
follow the exact Ehrenfest evolution at each time step along each stochastic
trajectory. Then, a set of more and more elaborated stochastic approximations
of a quantum problem is obtained which approach the exact solution when more
and more constraints are imposed, i.e. when $k$ increases. The Monte-Carlo
process might even become exact if the Hamiltonian $H$ applied on the trial
state can be written as a polynomial of $A_\alpha$. The formalism makes a
natural connection between quantum jumps in Hilbert space and phase-space
dynamics. We show that the derivation of stochastic Schroedinger equations can
be greatly simplified by taking advantage of the existence of this hierarchy of
approximations and its connection to the Ehrenfest theorem. Several examples
are illustrated: the free wave-packet expansion, the Kerr oscillator, a
generalized version of the Kerr oscillator, as well as interacting bosons or

generates both a parametric amplification also known as a {}&quot;squeezing

These operations, when applied properly, can robustly generate entanglement and
squeezing for the quantum resonator modes. Here, we present such coupling
schemes between a nanomechanical resonator and a superconducting electrical
resonator using applied microwave voltages as well as between two
superconducting lumped-element electrical resonators using a r.f.
SQUID-mediated tunable coupler. By calculating the logarithmic negativity of
the partially transposed density matrix, we quantitatively study the
entanglement generated at finite temperatures. We also show that
characterization of the nanomechanical resonator state after the quantum
operations can be achieved by detecting the electrical resonator only. Thus,
one of the electrical resonator modes can act as a probe to measure the
entanglement of the coupled systems and the degree of squeezing for the other
resonator mode.

system. Such expectation values can be measured by repeatedly preparing |psi&gt;
and coupling the system to an apparatus. For this method, the precision of the
measured value scales as 1/sqrt(N) for N repetitions of the experiment. For the
problem of estimating the parameter phi in an evolution exp(-i phi H), it is
possible to achieve precision 1/N (the quantum metrology limit) provided that
sufficient information about H and its spectrum is available. We consider the
more general problem of estimating expectations of operators A with minimal
prior knowledge of A. We give explicit algorithms that approach precision 1/N
given a bound on the eigenvalues of A or on their tail distribution. These
algorithms are particularly useful for simulating quantum systems on quantum

characterizations of optimal communication rates subject to various
restrictions and security requirements. Ideally, the optimal key rate for a
quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol would be given by {\em single-letter
formula} involving a simple optimization over a single use of an effective
channel. We explore the possibility of such a formula for one of the simplest
and most widely used QKD protocols--Bennett-Brassard-84 (BB84) with one way
classical post-processing. We show that a conjectured single-letter key-rate
formula is false, uncovering a deep ignorance about asymptotically good private
codes and pointing towards unfortunate complications in the theory of QKD.
These complications are not without benefit--with added complexity comes better
key rates than previously thought possible. We improve the threshold for secure
key generation from a bit error rate of 0.124 to 0.129.

  two-level atoms</title><description>  We study effects of direct interatomic interaction on cooperative processes
in atom-photon dynamics. Using a model of two-level atoms with Ising-type
interaction as an example, it is demonstrated that interparticle interaction
combined with atom-field coupling can introduce additional interatomic
correlations acting as a phase synchronizing factor. For the case of weakly
interacting atoms with $J&lt;\hbar\omega_0$, where $J$ is the interparticle
coupling constant and $\omega_0$ is the atomic frequency, dynamical regimes of
cooperative relaxation of atoms are analyzed in Born-Markov approximation both
numerically and using the mean field approximation. We show that interparticle
correlations induced by the direct interaction result in inhibition of
incoherent spontaneous decay leading to the regime of collective pulse
relaxation which differs from superradiance in nature. For superradiant
transition, the synchronizing effect of interatomic interaction is found to
manifest itself in enhancement of superradiance. When the interaction is strong
and $J&gt;\hbar\omega_0$, one-partice one-photon transitions are excluded and
transition to the regime of multiphoton relaxation occurs. Using a simple model
of two atoms in a high-Q single mode cavity we show that such transition is
accompanied by Rabi oscillations involving many-atom multiphoton states.
Dephasing effect of dipole-dipole interaction and solitonic mechanism of
relaxation are discussed.

optical parity measurements on electron spin qubits within coupled quantum

consists of the optical excitation of excitonic states followed by monitored
relaxation. Conditional on the observation of a photon, the system is projected
into the odd/even parity subspaces. Our model incorporates all the primary
sources of error, including detector inefficiency, effects of spatial

Through an analytical treatment we establish that the scheme is robust to such

we call symmetric side channels, consists of all channels mapping symmetrically
to their output and environment. The bound seems to be quite tight, and for
degradable quantum channels it coincides with the unassisted channel capacity.
Using this symmetric side channel capacity, we find new upper bounds on the

the infinite is complex and associated with zero norm states. Consequently, the
whole physical space contracts to a finite dimensional subspace with

chaotic atomic motion that may be quantified strictly by positive values of the
maximal Lyapunov exponent. It is shown that atom, depending on the value of its

potential or fly ballistically with weak chaotic oscillations of its momentum
or wander in the optical lattice changing the direction of motion in a chaotic
way. In the regime of chaotic wandering atomic motion is shown to have fractal

Poincar\'e mapping of atomic trajectories in an effective three-dimensional
phase space onto planes of atomic internal variables and momentum. We find
common features with typical non-hyperbolic Hamiltonian systems -- chains of
resonant islands of different sizes embedded in a stochastic sea, stochastic

processes, and has recently atracted much interest as a measure of the
susceptibility of dynamics to perturbations. A rich variety of regimes for
fidelity decay have emerged. The purpose of the present review is to describe
these regimes, to give the theory that supports them, and to show some
important applications and experiments. While we mention several approaches we
use time correlation functions as a backbone for the discussion. Vanicek's
uniform approach to semiclassics and random matrix theory provides an important
alternative or complementary aspects. Other methods will be mentioned as we go
along. Recent experiments in micro-wave cavities and in elastodynamic systems
as well as suggestions for experiments in quantum optics shall be discussed.

1/2, and find models that can potentially be used to implement error-resistant
quantum computation. Similar in spirit to classical neural networks, the
error-resistance of the system is achieved by encoding the qubits distributed
over the whole system. We therefore call our system a ''quantum neural
network'', and present a ''quantum neural network model of quantum
computation''. Qubits are encoded in a few quasi-degenerated low energy levels
of the whole system, separated by a large gap from the excited states, and
large energy barriers between themselves. We investigate protocols for
implementing a universal set of quantum logic gates in the system, by adiabatic
passage of a few low-lying energy levels of the whole system. Naturally
appearing and potentially dangerous distributed noise in the system leaves the
fidelity of the computation virtually unchanged, if it is not too strong. The
computation is also naturally resilient to local perturbations of the spins.

grating-stabilized 922 nm diode doubled in a single pass through potassium
niobate to 461 nm and a bare diode at 405 nm. Using this technique, we have
reduced the background pressure during the ion loading process by a factor of 2
compared to the conventional technique of electron bombardment. Initial ion
temperatures are low enough that the ions immediately form crystals. It is also
possible to observe the trapping region with a CCD camera during ion creation,

  counters</title><description>  The output of a photodetector consists of a current pulse whose charge has
the statistical distribution of the actual photon numbers convolved with a
Bernoulli distribution. Photodetectors are characterized by a nonunit quantum
efficiency, i.e. not all the photons lead to a charge, and by a finite
resolution, i.e. a different number of detected photons leads to a
discriminable values of the charge only up to a maximum value. We present a
detailed comparison, based on Monte Carlo simulated experiments and real data,
among the performances of detectors with different upper limits of counting
capability. In our scheme the inversion of Bernoulli convolution is performed
by maximum-likelihood methods assisted by measurements taken at different
quantum efficiencies. We show that detectors that are only able to discriminate
between zero, one and more than one detected photons are generally enough to
provide a reliable reconstruction of the photon statistics for single-peaked
distributions, while detectors with higher resolution limits do not lead to
further improvements. In addition, we demonstrate that, for semiclassical
states, even on/off detectors are enough to provide a good reconstruction.
Finally, we show that a reliable reconstruction of multi-peaked distributions
requires either higher quantum efficiency or better capability in
discriminating high number of detected photons.

  without rotational symmetry</title><description>  Standard security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols often
rely on symmetry arguments. In this paper, we prove the security of a
three-state protocol that does not possess rotational symmetry. The three-state
QKD protocol we consider involves three qubit states, where the first two
states, |0_z&gt; and |1_z&gt;, can contribute to key generation and the third state,
|+&gt;=(|0_z&gt;+|1_z&gt;)/\sqrt{2}, is for channel estimation. This protocol has been
proposed and implemented experimentally in some frequency-based QKD systems
where the three states can be prepared easily. Thus, by founding on the
security of this three-state protocol, we prove that these QKD schemes are, in
fact, unconditionally secure against any attacks allowed by quantum mechanics.
The main task in our proof is to upper bound the phase error rate of the qubits
given the bit error rates observed. Unconditional security can then be proved
not only for the ideal case of a single-photon source and perfect detectors,
but also for the realistic case of a phase-randomized weak coherent light
source and imperfect threshold detectors. Our result on the phase error rate
upper bound is independent of the loss in the channel. Also, we compare the
three-state protocol with the BB84 protocol. For the single-photon source case,
our result proves that the BB84 protocol strictly tolerates a higher quantum
bit error rate than the three-state protocol; while for the coherent-source
case, the BB84 protocol achieves a higher key generation rate and secure
distance than the three-state protocol when a decoy-state method is used.

single photonic qubits in the measurement process. These schemes can be made
robust to detector loss, spontaneous emission and cavity mismatching but as a
consequence the overhead costs grow rapidly, in particular when considering
single photon loss. In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and
highly efficient homodyne measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a
simple bucket measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success
probability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing
this probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost
and the time scaling. This leads to a &quot;no-measurement&quot; approach to building
cluster states, making use of geometric phases in phase space.

with $d$ non-prime. The entanglement of such states is revealed by the
construction of canonically associated entanglement witnesses. The structure of
the states is very simple and similar to the one of isotropic states: they are
a mixture of a separable and a pure entangled state whose supports are
orthogonal. Despite such simple structure, in an opportune interval of the
mixing parameter their entanglement is not revealed by partial transposition
nor by the realignment criterion, i.e. by any permutational criterion in the
bipartite setting. In the range in which the states are Positive under Partial
Transposition (PPT), they are not distillable; on the other hand, the states in
the considered class are provably distillable as soon as they are Nonpositive
under Partial Transposition (NPT). The states are associated to any set of more
than two pure states. The analysis is extended to the multipartite setting. By
an opportune selection of the set of multipartite pure states, it is possible
to construct mixed states which are PPT with respect to any choice of bipartite
cuts and nevertheless exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement. Finally, we
show that every $k$-positive but not completely positive map is associated to a
family of nondecomposable maps.

metric chosen is the performance of such a system on Shor's algorithm for
factoring large numbers: specifically, the quantum modular exponentiation step
that is the computational bottleneck. This dissertation introduces a number of
optimizations for the modular exponentiation. My algorithms reduce the latency,
or circuit depth, to complete the modular exponentiation of an n-bit number
from O(n^3) to O(n log^2 n) or O(n^2 log n), depending on architecture.
Calculations show that these algorithms are one million times and thirteen
thousand times faster, when factoring a 6,000-bit number, depending on
architecture. Extending to the quantum multicomputer, five different qubus
interconnect topologies are considered, and two forms of carry-ripple adder are
found to be the fastest for a wide range of performance parameters. The links
in the quantum multicomputer are serial; parallel links would provide only very
modest improvements in system reliability and performance. Two levels of the
Steane [[23,1,7]] error correction code will adequately protect our data for

Beginning with the seminal work of Katriel [Lett. Nuovo Cimento,

shown to have a rich combinatorial structure, mainly in virtue of a link with
the theory of partitions. In this paper, we attempt to enrich this link. By
considering linear representations of noncrossing partitions, we define the
notion of noncrossing normal ordering. Given the growing interest in
noncrossing partitions, because of their many unexpected connections (like, for
example, with free probability), noncrossing normal ordering appears to be an
intriguing notion. We explicitly give the noncrossing normally ordered form of
the functions (a^{r}(a^{\dag})^{s})^{n}) and (a^{r}+(a^{\dag})^{s})^{n}, plus
various special cases. We are able to establish for the first time bijections

time-dependence of the probability amplitude of the second photon in the
cascade has a sharply rising leading edge due to the detection of the first
photon, as results from causality. If a macroscopic ensemble of resonant
two-level absorbers is placed in the path of the second photon between the
radiation source and the detector, the photon absorption does not follow Beer's
law due to the time-asymmetric shape of the photon. For very short delay times
almost no absorption takes place, even in an optically dense medium. We analyze
the propagation of such a second photon in a thick resonant three-level
absorber if a narrow electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) window is

to a bell shape (EIT filtering). This bell-shaped photon interacts much more

fluctuations between two parallel hyperplanes in more than four dimensions,

the problem can be mapped upon the corresponding problem with a massless,
scalar field satisfying respectively Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.
The pressure between the plates is constant while the energy density is found
to diverge at the boundaries when there are extra dimensions. This can be
related to the fact that Maxwell theory is then no longer conformally
invariant. A similar behavior is known for the scalar field where a constant
energy density consistent with the pressure can be obtained by improving the
energy-momentum tensor with the Huggins term. This is not possible for the
Maxwell field. However, the change in the energy-momentum tensor with distance

term which stands for any piece of knowledge that is useful in assigning a
probability and that satisfies some additional logical properties. The idea,
which can be traced to Laplace and Jaynes, is that the usual inferential
reasonings about the probability-like parameters of a statistical model can be
conceived as reasonings about equivalence classes of `circumstances' - viz.,
real or hypothetical pieces of knowledge, like e.g. physical hypotheses, that
are useful in assigning a probability and satisfy some additional logical
properties - that are uniquely indexed by the probability distributions they
lead to.

et al.'s heuristic claim, the multiphoton absorption rate of a ``NOON'' quantum

quantum lithography by the use of a jointly Gaussian quantum state of light is
investigated, in order to illustrate the trade-off between resolution
enhancement and multiphoton absorption rate.

particle moving in a geometrically open billiard that consists of a number of
fixed hard-disk or hard-sphere scatterers. Using the technique of multiple
collision expansions we provide a first-principle analytical calculation of the
time-dependent autocorrelation function for the wave packet in the high-energy
diffraction regime, in which the particle's de Broglie wave length, while being
small compared to the size of the scatterers, is large enough to prevent the
formation of geometric shadow over distances of the order of the particle's
free flight path. The hard-disk or hard-sphere scattering system must be
sufficiently dilute in order for this high-energy diffraction regime to be
achievable. Apart from the overall exponential decay, the autocorrelation
function exhibits a generally complicated sequence of relatively strong peaks
corresponding to partial revivals of the wave packet. Both the exponential
decay (or escape) rate and the revival peak structure are predominantly
determined by the underlying classical dynamics. A relation between the escape
rate, and the Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of the

strengthened by generalization to three spatial dimensions. The results of the

Phase-conjugate OCT (PC-OCT), introduced here, shows that non-classical light

entanglement of assistance of 0.92 EPR pairs per W, while our protocol can
asymptotically distill 1 EPR pair per W between random pairs of parties, which

particle interacting with a dilute and in general non-equilibrium gaseous
environment in the low density limit is outlined. The low density limit is the
kinetic Markovian regime when only pair collisions (i.e., collisions of the
test particle with one particle of the gas at one time moment) contribute to
the dynamics. In the white noise approach one first proves that the appropriate
operators describing the gas converge in the sense of appropriate matrix
elements to certain operators of quantum white noise. Then these white noise
operators are used to derive quantum white noise and quantum stochastic
equations describing the approximate dynamics of the total system consisting of
the particle and the gas. The derivation is given ab initio, starting from the
exact microscopic quantum dynamics. The limiting dynamics is described by a
quantum stochastic equation driven by a quantum Poisson process. This equation
then applied to the derivation of quantum Langevin equation and linear
Boltzmann equation for the reduced density matrix of the test particle. The

treatment for the N-body quantum-confined system. Taking advantage of the
symmetry of the zeroth-order configuration, we use group theoretic techniques
and the FG matrix method from quantum chemistry to obtain analytic results for
frequencies and normal modes. This method directly accounts for each two-body
interaction, rather than an average interaction so that even lowest-order
results include beyond-mean-field effects. It is thus appropriate for the study
of both weakly and strongly interacting systems and the transition between
them. While previous work has focused on energies, lowest-order wave functions
yield important information such as the nature of excitations and expectation
values of physical observables at low orders including density profiles. Higher
orders in DPT also require as input the zeroth-order wave functions. In the
earlier paper we presented a program for calculating the analytic normal-mode
coordinates of the large-D system and illustrated the procedure by deriving the
two simplest normal modes. In this paper we complete this analysis by deriving
the remaining, and more complex, normal coordinates of the system.

in quantum mechanics. Its solution yields total transparency (100% tunneling)
at discrete energies. This dramatic phenomenon results from coherent
interference among many trajectories, and it is the basis of transport through
periodic structures. Resonant tunneling of electrons is commonly seen in
semiconducting 'quantum dots'. Here we demonstrate that detecting
(distinguishing) electron trajectories in a quantum dot (QD) renders the QD
nearly insulating. We couple trajectories in the QD to a 'detector' by
employing edge channels in the integer quantum Hall regime. That is, we couple
electrons tunneling through an inner channel to electrons in the neighboring
outer, 'detector' channel. A small bias applied to the detector channel
suffices to dephase (quench) the resonant tunneling completely. We derive a
formula for dephasing that agrees well with our data and implies that just a
few electrons passing through the detector channel suffice to dephase the QD
completely. This basic experiment shows how path detection in a QD induces a
transition from delocalization (due to coherent tunneling) to localization
(sequential tunneling).

Dirichlet cylinder case. For weak-coupling,through $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^2)$,
the total energy is shown to vanish by both analytic and numerical arguments,
based both on Green's-function and zeta-function techniques. Divergences
occurring in the calculation are shown to be absorbable by renormalization of
physical parameters of the model. The global energy may be obtained by
integrating the local energy density only when the latter is supplemented by an
energy term residing precisely on the surface of the cylinder. The latter is
identified as the integrated local energy density of the cylindrical shell when
the latter is physically expanded to have finite thickness. Inside and outside
the delta-function shell, the local energy density diverges as the surface of
the shell is approached; the divergence is weakest when the conformal stress
tensor is used to define the energy density. A real global divergence first
occurs in $\mathcal{O}(\lambda^3)$, as anticipated, but the proof is supplied
here for the first time; this divergence is entirely associated with the
surface energy, and does {\em not} reflect divergences in the local energy
density as the surface is approached.

  two-photon interference</title><description>  We study the interference structure of the second-order intensity correlation
function for polarization-entangled two-photon light obtained from type-II
collinear frequency-degenerate spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC).
The structure is visualised due to the spreading of the two-photon amplitude as
two-photon light propagates through optical fibre with group-velocity
dispersion (GVD). Because of the spreading, polarization-entangled Bell states
can be obtained without any birefringence compensation at the output of the
nonlinear crystal; instead, proper time selection of the intensity correlation
function is required. A birefringent material inserted at the output of the
nonlinear crystal (either reducing the initial o-e delay between the oppositely
polarized twin photons or increasing this delay) leads to a more complicated
interference structure of the correlation function.

  a universal quantum computer</title><description>  It has been shown (Arxiv: quant-ph/0507236) that a universal quantum computer
could be powerful enough to solve efficiently the quantum search problem, and
the reversible and unitary halting protocol based on the state-locking pulse
field is the key component to construct the efficient quantum search processes,
while the state-locking pulse field is the key component to generate the
reversible and unitary halting protocol. In this paper the reversible and
unitary halting protocol and the generalized state-locking pulse field have
been extensively investigated theoretically. The basic principles to construct
the state-locking pulse field and design the reversible and unitary halting
protocol are studied in detail. A generalized state-locking pulse field is
generally dependent upon the time and space variables. It could be a sequence
of time- and space-dependent electromagnetic pulse fields and could also
contain the time- and space-dependent potential fields. Thus, the reversible
and unitary halting protocol built up out of the state-locking pulse field
generally consists of a sequence of time- and space-dependent unitary evolution
processes. It is shown how the quantum control process is constructed to
simulate efficiently the reversible and unitary halting protocol. An improved
subspace-reduction quantum program and circuit based on the reversible and
unitary halting protocol is proposed as the key component to construct further
an efficient quantum search process. A simple atomic physical system that is an
atomic ion or a neutral atom in the double-well potential field is proposed to
show how the state-locking pulse field is generated and how to implement the
reversible and unitary halting protocol.

Hawking's semi-classical argument, which dictates that the quantum coherence

of quantum mechanics, the evolution of pure states to pure states. For over
three decades, this contradiction has been one of the major obstacles to the
ultimate unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Recently, a
final-state boundary condition inside the black hole was proposed to resolve
this contradiction for bosons. However, no such a remedy exists for fermions
yet even though Hawking effect for fermions has been studied for sometime.
Here, I report that the black hole information paradox can be resolved for the
fermions by imposing a final state boundary condition, which resembles local
measurement with post selection. In this scenario, the evaporation can be seen
as the post selection determined by random unitary transformation. It is also
found that the evaporation processes strongly depends on the boundary condition

status and one would expect physical theories to involve final as well as
initial boundary conditions. A plausible consistency condition between the
initial and final boundary conditions in non-relativistic quantum mechanics
leads to the idea that the properties of macroscopic quantum systems,
relevantly measuring instruments, are uniquely determined by the boundary
conditions. An important element in reaching that conclusion is that
preparations and measurements belong in a special class because they involve
many subsystems, at least some of which do not form superpositions of their
physical properties before the boundary conditions are imposed. It is suggested
that the primary role of the formalism of standard quantum mechanics is to
provide the consistency condition on the boundary conditions rather than the
properties of quantum systems. Expressions are proposed for assigning a set of
(unmeasured) physical properties to a quantum system at all times. The physical
properties avoid the logical inconsistencies implied by the no-go theorems
because they are assigned differently from standard quantum mechanics. Since
measurement outcomes are determined by the boundary conditions, they help
determine, rather than are determined by, the physical properties of quantum

employing Reed-Muller spectra are introduced and shown to complement earlier
synthesis approaches. The template simplification suggested in earlier work is
enhanced through introduction of a faster and more efficient template
application algorithm, updated (shorter) classification of the templates, and
presentation of the new templates of sizes 7 and 9. A novel ``resynthesis''
approach is introduced wherein a sequence of gates is chosen from a network,
and the reversible specification it realizes is resynthesized as an independent
problem in hopes of reducing the network cost. Empirical results are presented
to show that the methods are effective both in terms of the realization of all
3x3 reversible functions and larger reversible benchmark specifications.

  classical and quantum mechanics wrong?</title><description>  We analyze anomalies in data to test the violation of Bell's inequality for
the EPR-Bohm experiment. We found that the experimental correlations for photon
polarization have an intriguing property. In the experimental data there are
visible non-negligible deviations of probabilities $P_{++}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha,
\beta), P_{+-}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta), P_{-+}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta),
P_{--}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta) $ from the predictions of quantum mechanics,
namely, $P_{++}(\alpha, \beta)=P_{--}(\alpha, \beta)=
{1/2}\cos^2(\alpha-\beta)$ and $P_{+-}=P_{-+}(\alpha,
\beta)={1/2}\sin^2(\alpha-\beta).$ However, in some mysterious way those
deviations compensate each other and finally the correlation
$E^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)= P_{++}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)-
P_{+-}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)- P_{-+}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)+
P_{--}^{\rm{exp}}(\alpha, \beta)$ is in the complete agreement with the
QM-prediction, namely, $E(\alpha, \beta)= P_{++}(\alpha, \beta)- P_{+-}(\alpha,
\beta)- P_{-+}(\alpha, \beta)+ P_{--}(\alpha, \beta)= \cos 2(\alpha-\beta).$
Therefore such anomalies play no role in the Bell's inequality framework.
Nevertheless, other linear combinations of experimental probabilities do not
have such a compensation property. There can be found non-negligible deviations
from predictions of quantum mechanics. Thus neither classical nor quantum model
can pass the whole family of statistical tests given by all possible linear
combinations of the EPR-Bohm probabilities. Does it mean that both models are
wrong?

discovery, that correlations measured on entangled quantum systems are at

confirming the quantum predictions. However, it is still experimentally
undecided whether quantum entanglement can survive global distances, as
predicted by quantum theory. Here we report the violation of the

separated by 144 km between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife via an

characteristic for a Space-to-ground experiment. The distance in our experiment
exceeds all previous free-space experiments by more than one order of magnitude

longer distances can only be reached using air- or space-based platforms. The

  micro-mirror</title><description>  Recent experimental progress in table-top experiments or gravitational-wave
interferometers has enlightened the unique displacement sensitivity offered by
optical interferometry. As the mirrors move in response to radiation pressure,
higher power operation, though crucial for further sensitivity enhancement,
will however increase quantum effects of radiation pressure, or even jeopardize
the stable operation of the detuned cavities proposed for next-generation
interferometers. The appearance of such optomechanical instabilities is the
result of the nonlinear interplay between the motion of the mirrors and the
optical field dynamics. In a detuned cavity indeed, the displacements of the
mirror are coupled to intensity fluctuations, which modifies the effective
dynamics of the mirror. Such &quot;optical spring&quot; effects have already been
demonstrated on the mechanical damping of an electromagnetic waveguide with a
moving wall, on the resonance frequency of a specially designed flexure
oscillator, and through the optomechanical instability of a silica
micro-toroidal resonator. We present here an experiment where a
micro-mechanical resonator is used as a mirror in a very high-finesse optical
cavity and its displacements monitored with an unprecedented sensitivity. By
detuning the cavity, we have observed a drastic cooling of the micro-resonator
by intracavity radiation pressure, down to an effective temperature of 10 K. We
have also obtained an efficient heating for an opposite detuning, up to the
observation of a radiation-pressure induced instability of the resonator.
Further experimental progress and cryogenic operation may lead to the
experimental observation of the quantum ground state of a mechanical resonator,
either by passive or active cooling techniques.

are segmented in the axial direction, the trap allows the transport of ions
between different spatial regions. Starting with realistic numerically obtained
axial potentials, we optimize the transport of an ion such that the motional
degrees of freedom are not excited, even though the transport speed far exceeds
the adiabatic regime. In our optimization we achieve a transport within roughly
two oscillation periods in the axial trap potential compared to typical
adiabatic transports that take of the order 100 oscillations. Furthermore
heating due to quantum mechanical effects is estimated and suppression

  of quantum vortex states</title><description>  We consider the evolution of a two-mode system of bosons under the action of
a Hamiltonian that generates linear SU(2) transformations. The Hamiltonian is
generic in that it represents a host of entanglement mechanisms, which can thus
be treated in a unified way. We start by solving the quantum dynamics
analytically when the system is initially in a Fock state. We show how the two
modes get entangled by evolution to produce a coherent superposition of vortex
states in general, and a single vortex state under certain conditions. The
degree of entanglement between the modes is measured by finding the explicit
analytical dependence of the Von Neumann entropy on the system parameters. The
reduced state of each mode is analyzed by means of its correlation function and
spatial coherence function. Remarkably, our analysis is shown to be equally as
valid for a variety of initial states that can be prepared from a two-mode Fock
state via a unitary transformation and for which the results can be obtained by
mere inspection of the corresponding results for an initial Fock state. As an
example, we consider a quantum vortex as the initial state and also find
conditions for its revival and charge conjugation. While studying the evolution
of the initial vortex state, we have encountered and explained an interesting
situation in which the entropy of the system does not evolve whereas its wave
function does. Although the modal concept has been used throughout the paper,
it is important to note that the theory is equally applicable for a
two-particle system in which each particle is represented by its bosonic
creation and annihilation operators.

super-adiabatic basis allows to calculate the non-adiabatic transition
probability P in the slow-sweep limit, without specifying the Hamiltonian
explicitly. It is found that P consists of a ``dynamical'' and a
``geometrical'' factors. The former is determined by the complex adiabatic
eigenvalues E_(t), only, whereas the latter solely requires the knowledge of
\alpha_(+-)(t), the ratio of the components of each of the adiabatic
eigenstates. Both factors can be split into a universal one, depending only on
the complex level crossing points, and a nonuniversal one, involving the full
time dependence of E_(+-)(t). This general result is applied to the
Akulin-Schleich model where the initial upper level is damped with damping
constant $\gamma$. For analytic power-law sweeps we find that Stueckelberg
oscillations of P exist for gamma smaller than a critical value gamma_c and
disappear for gamma &gt; gamma_c. A physical interpretation of this behavior will
be presented by use of a damped harmonic oscillator.

leading correction, in terms of the nonlinearity scale, to the energy
eigenvalues of the linear Schrodinger equation in the presence of an external

(i) For nodeless ground states, the energy shifts are subleading in the
nonlinearity parameter compared to the shifts for the excited states, (ii) the
shifts for the excited states are due predominantly to contribution from the
nodes of the unperturbed wavefunctions and (iii) the energy shifts for excited

large values, vanishing at a universal critical value that is not manifest in
the equation. Some of these features hold true for higher dimensional problems.
We also study two exactly solved nonlinear Schrodinger equations so as to

femtosecond pump pulses to generate multi-photon states with precise timing
often requires spectral filtering to maintain a high quality of polarization
entanglement. This typically reduces the efficiency of photon pair collection.
We experimentally map the polarization correlations of photon pairs from such a

dependent imbalance between contributions from the two possible decay paths of
SPDC is identified as the reason for a reduction in entanglement quality
observed with femtosecond pump pulses. Our spectral measurements allow to

clear independent existence of physical reality, we need to search the reasons
in the relationship between our questions (the observers) and the consequent
answers (always estimated by the same observers). Finally, we infer that every
theory is affected by our &quot;questions&quot;, so we cannot speak about an
unconditional and independent theory underlying physical reality. Plan of the
paper. The existence of physical reality underlying quantum states: (i) it
before bit,(ii)it without bit,(iii)it from bit.

quantum information science, quantum many-body physics, and quantum field
theory. We use tools from these three fields to analyze problems that arise in
the interdisciplinary intersection. More concretely, in Chapter 1 we consider
the irreversibility of renormalization group flows from a quantum information
perspective by using majorization theory and conformal field theory. In Chapter
2 we compute the entanglement of a single copy of a bipartite quantum system
for a variety of models by using techniques from conformal field theory and
Toeplitz matrices. The entanglement entropy of the so-called
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is computed in Chapter 3, showing analogies with
that of (1+1)-dimensional quantum systems. In Chapter 4 we apply the ideas of
scaling of quantum correlations in quantum phase transitions to the study of
quantum algorithms, focusing on Shor's factorization algorithm and quantum
algorithms by adiabatic evolution solving an NP-complete and the searching
problems. Also, in Chapter 5 we use techniques originally inspired by
condensed-matter physics to develop classical simulations, using the so-called
matrix product states, of an adiabatic quantum algorithm. Finally, in Chapter 6
we consider the behavior of some families of quantum algorithms from the
perspective of majorization theory. The structure within each Chapter is such
that the last section always summarizes the basic results. Some general
conclusions and possible future directions are briefly discussed in Chapter 7.
Appendix A, Appendix B and Appendix C respectively deal with some basic notions
on majorization theory, conformal field theory, and classical complexity
theory.

additional information about the state after the measurement, or more
generally, after a quantum memory bound applies. In particular, the following
special case plays an important role in quantum cryptographic protocols in the
bounded storage model: Given a string x encoded in an unknown basis chosen from
a set of mutually unbiased bases, you may perform any measurement, but then
store at most q qubits of quantum information. Later on, you learn which basis
was used. How well can you compute a function f(x) of x, given the initial
measurement outcome, the q qubits and the additional basis information? We
first show a lower bound on the success probability for any balanced function,
and any number of mutually unbiased bases, beating the naive strategy of simply
guessing the basis. We then show that for two bases, any Boolean function f(x)
can be computed perfectly if you are allowed to store just a single qubit,
independent of the number of possible input strings x. However, we show how to
construct three bases, such that you need to store all qubits in order to
compute f(x) perfectly. We then investigate how much advantage the additional
basis information can give for a Boolean function. To this end, we prove
optimal bounds for the success probability for the AND and the XOR function for
up to three mutually unbiased bases. Our result shows that the gap in success
probability can be maximal: without the basis information, you can never do
better than guessing the basis, but with this information, you can compute f(x)
perfectly. We also exhibit an example where the extra information does not give
any advantage at all.

tolerate are based on fault-tolerance schemes relying heavily on postselecting
on no detected errors. However, there has been no proof that these schemes give
even a positive tolerable noise threshold. A technique to prove a positive
threshold, for probabilistic noise models, is presented. The main idea is to
maintain strong control over the distribution of errors in the quantum state at

of control with postselection. But in fact, the error distribution can be
written as a mixture of nearby distributions each satisfying strong

(EAQEC) codes, a generalization of the stabilizer formalism to the setting in
which the sender and receiver have access to pre-shared entanglement.
Conventional stabilizer codes are equivalent to dual-containing symplectic
codes. In contrast, EAQEC codes do not require the dual-containing condition,
which greatly simplifies their construction. We show how any quaternary
classical code can be made into a EAQEC code. In particular, efficient modern
codes, like LDPC codes, which attain the Shannon capacity, can be made into
EAQEC codes attaining the hashing bound. In a quantum computation setting,
EAQEC codes give rise to catalytic quantum codes which maintain a region of
inherited noiseless qubits.
 We also give an alternative construction of EAQEC codes by making classical
entanglement assisted codes coherent.

in \cite{Quantumness}, which is closely related to the fidelity loss in
transmission of the quantum states through a classical channel. In
\cite{Fuchs}, Fuchs showed that in $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, minimum
quantumness is $\frac{2}{d+1}$, and this can be achieved by all rays in the
space. He left an open problem, asking whether fewer than $d^2$ states can
achieve this bound. Recently, in a different context, A. J. Scott introduced a
concept of generalized $t$-design in \cite{GenSphet}, which is a natural
generalization of spherical $t$-design. In this paper, we show that the lower
bound on the quantumness can be achieved if and only if the states form a
generalized 2-design. As a corollary, we show that this bound can be only
achieved if the number of states are larger or equal to $d^2$, answering the
open problem. Furthermore, we also show that the minimal set of such ensemble
is Symmetric Informationally Complete POVM(SIC-POVM). This leads to an
equivalence relation between SIC-POVM and minimal set of ensemble achieving
minimal quantumness.

conceptual analysis of quantum measurement seems to suggest that quantum
mechanics can be done without direct sums, expressed entirely in terms of the
tensor product. The corresponding axioms define classical spaces as objects
that allow copying and deleting data. Indeed, the information exchange between
the quantum and the classical worlds is essentially determined by their
distinct capabilities to copy and delete data. The sums turn out to be an
implicit implementation of this capabilities. Realizing it through explicit
axioms not only dispenses with the unnecessary structural baggage, but also
allows a simple and intuitive graphical calculus. In category-theoretic terms,
classical data types are dagger-compact Frobenius algebras, and quantum spectra
underlying quantum measurements are Eilenberg-Moore coalgebras induced by these
Frobenius algebras.

one of two non-orthogonal states and subsequently subjected to dephasing noise.
The task is to use measurement and feedback control to attempt to correct the

information about the system and disturbing it through measurement back-action.
We study the performance of a quantum control scheme that makes use of this

varied over non-negative reals. The graph is uniform mixing if it visits the
uniform distribution. Our results include the following:
  (a) All weighted complete multipartite graphs are instantaneous universal
mixing. This is in contrast to the fact that no unweighted complete
multipartite graphs are uniform mixing (except for the four-cycle).
  (b) The weighted claw or star graph is a minimally connected instantaneous
universal mixing graph. In fact, as a corollary, the unweighted claw is
instantaneous uniform mixing. This adds a new family of uniform mixing graphs
to a list that so far contains only the hypercubes.
  (c) Any weighted graph is average almost-uniform mixing unless its spectral
type is sublinear in the size of the graph. This provides a nearly tight
characterization for average uniform mixing on circulant graphs.
  (d) No weighted graphs are average universal mixing. This shows that weights
do not help to achieve average universal mixing, unlike the instantaneous case.
  Our proofs exploit the spectra of the underlying weighted graphs and path
collapsing arguments.

be recovered by a unitary operation, where the notion of recovery is more
relaxed than the notion of correction insofar as it does not protect the
subsystem from subsequent iterations of the noise. We also demonstrate that in
the case of unital noise operations one can identify a subset of all
correctable subsystems -- those that can be corrected by a single unitary
operation -- as the noiseless subsystems for the composition of the noise
operation with its dual. Using the recently developed structure theory for
noiseless subsystems, the identification of such unitarily correctable
subsystems is reduced to an algebraic exercise.

function is introduced by E. Wigner in 1932. However, there is no analytical

presented. Our derivation is based on two assumptions, these are A) by taking
the integral of Wigner distribution function, with respect to configuration

Similarly, and in addition to Wigner distribution function, the distribution
function of Sobouti-Nasiri, which is imaginary, is also derived.

  Pulses</title><description>  Atomic cadmium ions are loaded into radiofrequency ion traps by
photoionization of atoms in a cadmium vapor with ultrafast laser pulses. The
photoionization is driven through an intermediate atomic resonance with a
frequency-quadrupled mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser that produces pulses of
either 100 fsec or 1 psec duration at a central wavelength of 229 nm. The large
bandwidth of the pulses photoionizes all velocity classes of the Cd vapor,
resulting in high loading efficiencies compared to previous ion trap loading
techniques. Measured loading rates are compared with a simple theoretical
model, and we conclude that this technique can potentially ionize every atom
traversing the laser beam within the trapping volume. This may allow the
operation of ion traps with lower levels of background pressures and less trap
electrode surface contamination. The technique and laser system reported here
should be applicable to loading most laser-cooled ion species.

induce transitions between discrete energy levels of the atom, no matter what
is its frequency. It means in the quantum transition of an atom interacting
with an intense laser of circular frequency $\omega$, the energy difference
between the initial and the final states of the atom is not necessarily being
an integer multiple of the quantum energy $\hbar\omega$. The absorption spectra
become continuous. The Bohr condition is violated. The energy of photoelectrons
becomes light intensity dependent in the intense laser photoelectric effect.
The transition probabilities and cross sections of photo-excitations and
photo-ionizations are laser intensity dependent, showing that these processes
cannot be reduced to the results of interactions between the atom and separate
individual photons, they are rather the processes of the atom interacting with
the laser as a whole. The interaction of photons on atoms are not simply
additive. The effects are non-perturbative and non-linear. Some numerical
results for processes between hydrogen atom and intense circularly polarized
laser, illustrating the non-perturbative and non-linear character of the
atom-laser interaction, are given.

acoustic waves are then induced in the GaAs substrate, which create a two

potential is described by a Hubbard model with long-range Coulomb interactions.
The state of the electrons in this system can be probed via its conductance and

vanishes at critical points of quantum phase transitions. In this article we
study the relation between the transfer speed and quality of such a system and
the size of its spectral gap. We find that the transfer is almost perfect but

inseparability among N parties. In particular, this scheme is found to succeed
for any nonzero quantum efficiency of photodetectors. Second, we consider a
quantum teleportation network using linear optics without auxiliary modes. The
conditional teleportation can be optimized by a suitable choice of the
transmittance of the beam splitter in the Bell measurement. Specifically, we
identify the conditions under which maximum fidelity larger than classical

  Reference Frames, and Beyond</title><description>  This paper concentrates on a particular example of a constraint imposed by
superselection rules (SSRs): that which applies when the parties (Alice and
Bob) cannot distinguish among certain quantum objects they have. This arises
naturally in the context of ensemble quantum information processing such as in
liquid NMR. We discuss how a SSR for the symmetric group can be applied, and
show how the extractable entanglement can be calculated analytically in certain
cases, with a maximum bipartite entanglement in an ensemble of N Bell-state
pairs scaling as log(N) as N goes to infinity . We discuss the apparent
disparity with the asymptotic (N &gt;&gt; 1) recovery of unconstrained entanglement
for other sorts of superselection rules, and show that the disparity disappears
when the correct notion of applying the symmetric group SSR to multiple copies
is used. Next we discuss reference frames in the context of this SSR, showing
the relation to the work of von Korff and Kempe [Phys. Rev. Lett. 93, 260502
(2004)]. The action of a reference frame can be regarded as the analog of
activation in mixed-state entanglement. We also discuss the analog of
distillation: there exist states such that one copy can act as an imperfect
reference frame for another copy. Finally we present an example of a stronger
operational constraint, that operations must be non-collective as well as
symmetric. Even under this stronger constraint we nevertheless show that
Bell-nonlocality (and hence entanglement) can be demonstrated for an ensemble
of N Bell-state pairs no matter how large N is. This last work is a
generalization of that of Mermin [Phys. Rev. D 22, 356 (1980)].

negativities through local unitary qubit rotations, a combined analysis of

genuine tripartite, W-state like and bipartite entanglement, for three qubit
composite system. To illustrate the point, entanglement of three qubit GHZ

While genuine N-partite entanglement of a composite system is generated by
N-way coherences, N-partite entanglement in general can be present due to

But otherwise, when the input set is restricted, it is possible to find

basic task in quantum processing. When composite systems are subjected to local
measurements the measurement data will exhibit correlations, whether these
systems are classical or quantum. Therefore, the observation of correlations in
the classical measurement record does not automatically imply the presence of
quantum correlations in the system under investigation. In this work we explore
the question of when correlations, or other measurement data, are sufficient to
guarantee the existence of a certain amount of quantum correlations in the
system and when additional information, such as the degree of purity of the
system, is needed to do so. Various measurement settings are discussed, both
numerically and analytically. Exact results and lower bounds on the least
entanglement consistent with the observations are presented. The approach is

Lie groups and quotient spaces provide most of what is needed insofar as
controllability of non-dissipative systems is concerned. However, in an

present a systematic approach to a class of such problems for which it is
possible to avoid some of the technical issues. In particular, we analyze
controllability for infinite-dimensional bilinear systems under assumptions
that make controllability possible using trajectories lying in a nested family

states. We show that the strategy is optimal in a local minimax sense for the
trace norm distance as well as other locally quadratic figures of merit. Local
minimax optimality means that given $n$ identical qubits, there exists no
estimator which can perform better than the proposed estimator on a
neighborhood of size $n^{-1/2}$ of an arbitrary state. In particular, it is
asymptotically Bayesian optimal for a large class of prior distributions.
  We present a physical implementation of the optimal estimation strategy based
on continuous time measurements in a field that couples with the qubits.
  The crucial ingredient of the result is the concept of local asymptotic
normality (or LAN) for qubits. This means that, for large $n$, the statistical
model described by $n$ identically prepared qubits is locally equivalent to a
model with only a classical Gaussian distribution and a Gaussian state of a
quantum harmonic oscillator.
  The term `local' refers to a shrinking neighborhood around a fixed state
$\rho_{0}$. An essential result is that the neighborhood radius can be chosen
arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/4}$. This allows us to use a two steps procedure by
which we first localize the state within a smaller neighborhood of radius
$n^{-1/2+\epsilon}$, and then use LAN to perform optimal estimation.

  Non-Fixed Causal Structure</title><description>  General relativity is a deterministic theory with non-fixed causal structure.
Quantum theory is a probabilistic theory with fixed causal structure. In this
paper we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal
structure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum
theory. The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical
theory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of
quantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We
apply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to
quantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular
region of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is
a second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above
the first level physical compression for the component regions. Each
application of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a
matrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical
theory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of
physical compression. This third level of physical compression gives rise to a
new mathematical object which we call the causaloid. From the causaloid for a
particular physical theory we can calculate verything the physical theory can
calculate. This approach allows us to set up a framework for calculating
probabilistic correlations in data without imposing a fixed causal structure
(such as a background time). We show how to put quantum theory in this
framework (thus providing a new formulation of this theory). We indicate how
general relativity might be put into this framework and how the framework might
be used to construct a theory of quantum gravity.

  Non-constant Curvature: I. Darboux Spaces DI and DII</title><description>  In this paper the Feynman path integral technique is applied for
superintegrable potentials on two-dimensional spaces of non-constant curvature:
these spaces are Darboux spaces D_I and D_II, respectively. On D_I there are
three and on D_II four such potentials, respectively. We are able to evaluate
the path integral in most of the separating coordinate systems, leading to
expressions for the Green functions, the discrete and continuous
wave-functions, and the discrete energy-spectra. In some cases, however, the
discrete spectrum cannot be stated explicitly, because it is either determined
by a transcendental equation involving parabolic cylinder functions (Darboux
space I), or by a higher order polynomial equation. The solutions on D_I in
particular show that superintegrable systems are not necessarily degenerate. We
can also show how the limiting cases of flat space (constant curvature zero)
and the two-dimensional hyperboloid (constant negative curvature) emerge.

operations and repeated preparation of certain ancilla states. Which ancilla
states suffice for universality? This &quot;magic states distillation&quot; question is
closely related to quantum fault tolerance. Lower bounds on the noise tolerable
on the ancilla help give lower bounds on the tolerable noise rate threshold for
fault-tolerant computation. Upper bounds show the limits of threshold
upper-bound arguments based on the Gottesman-Knill theorem.
  We extend the range of single-qubit mixed states that are known to give
universality, by using a simple parity-checking operation. For applications to
proving threshold lower bounds, certain practical stability characteristics are
often required, and we also show a stable distillation procedure.
  No distillation upper bounds are known beyond those given by the
Gottesman-Knill theorem. One might ask whether distillation upper bounds reduce
to upper bounds for single-qubit ancilla states. For multi-qubit pure states
and previously considered two-qubit ancilla states, the answer is yes. However,
we exhibit two-qubit mixed states that are not mixtures of stabilizer states,
but for which every postselected stabilizer reduction from two qubits to one
outputs a mixture of stabilizer states. Distilling such states would require
true multi-qubit state distillation methods.

  The main result of this paper is the statement that the superadditivity of

implies the superadditivity of the convex closure of the output entropy for all
infinite dimensional channels, which provides the analogous statements for the
strong superadditivity of the EoF and for the additivity of the minimal output
entropy.
  The above result also provides infinite dimensional generalization of Shor's
theorem stated equivalence of different additivity properties.
  The superadditivity of the convex closure of the output entropy (and hence
the additivity of the minimal output entropy) for two infinite dimensional
channels with one of them a direct sum of noiseless and entanglement-breaking
channels are derived from the corresponding finite dimensional results.
  In the context of the additivity problem some observations concerning
complementary infinite dimensional channels are considered.

We prove that if we have a finite number $N$ of identically prepared quantum

Clifford Algebra approach</title><description>  Using the Clifford algebra formalism we extend the quantum jumps algorithm of
the Event Enhanced Quantum Theory (EEQT) to convex state figures other than
those stemming from convex hulls of complex projective spaces that form the
basis for the standard quantum theory. We study quantum jumps on n-dimensional
spheres, jumps that are induced by symmetric configurations of non-commuting
state monitoring detectors. The detectors cause quantum jumps via geometrically
induced conformal maps (Mobius transformations) and realize iterated function
systems (IFS) with fractal attractors located on n-dimensional spheres. We also
extend the formalism to mixed states, represented by &quot;density matrices&quot;. As a
numerical illustration we study quantum fractals on the circle, two--sphere

600 cell,and 120 cell). The invariant measure on the attractor is approximated
by the powers of the Markov operator. In the appendices we calculate the
Radon-Nikodym derivative of the SO(n+1) invariant measure on S^n under
SO(1,n+1) transformations and discuss the Hamilton's &quot;icossian calculus&quot; as

characterization of positive elements in a Clifford algebra Cl(n+1) as
generalized Lorentz boosts, and their action as Moebius transformation on
n-sphere, and a decomposition of any element of Spin^+(1,n+1) into a boost and
a rotation, including the explicit formula for the pullback of the O(n+1)

It renders generally valid expressions for both the forces between bodies and

entanglement in quantum mechanics; indicating that experiments on physically
separated quantum mechanical systems cannot be given a local realistic
description. However, despite the importance of Bell inequalities, it is not
known in general how to determine whether a given entangled state will violate
a Bell inequality. This is because one can choose to make many different
measurements on a quantum system to test any given Bell inequality and the
optimization over measurements is a high-dimensional variational problem. In
order to better understand this problem we present algorithms that provide, for
a given quantum state, both a lower bound and an upper bound on the maximal
expectation value of a Bell operator. Both bounds apply techniques from convex
optimization and the methodology for creating upper bounds allows them to be
systematically improved. In many cases these bounds determine measurements that
would demonstrate violation of the Bell inequality or provide a bound that
rules out the possibility of a violation. Examples are given to illustrate how
these algorithms can be used to conclude definitively if some quantum states

B). Qubit a (b) interacts with qubit A (B) via a spin exchange-like unitary

if both interactions are equal and the entire four qubit system is isolated. We
also consider the case when the target pair of qubits is subjected to losses

of the XOR of the two bits received. We show that, when the provers are allowed
to coordinate their behavior using a shared entangled quantum state, a perfect

success probability for simultaneously playing a collection of XOR proof
systems is exactly the product of the individual optimal success probabilities.
This property is remarkable in view of the fact that, in the classical case

The theorem is proved by analyzing parities of XOR proof systems using

state-space H_1 as a standard representation of U(2) and the n-qubit state
space H_n=(H_1)^{(x) n} as the n-fold tensor product of standard
representations. Representation theory then decomposes H_n into irreducible
subrepresentations of K parametrized by combinatorial objects known as Young
diagrams. We argue that n-1 classically controlled measurement circuits, each a
Fredkin-gate interferometer, may be used to form a projection operator onto a
random Young diagram irrep within H_n. For H_2, the two irreps happen to be
orthogonal and correspond to the symmetric and wedge product. The latter is
spanned by ket{Psi^-}, and the standard two-qubit swap interferometer requiring
a single Fredkin gate suffices in this case. In the n-qubit case, it is
possible to extract many copies of ket{Psi^-}. Thus applying this process using
nondestructive Fredkin interferometers allows for the creation of entangled

well as classical simulated annealing (CA), previously tested on the same
optimization problem. We identify the issue of importance sampling, i.e., the
necessity of possessing reasonably good (variational) trial wavefunctions, as
the key point of the algorithm. We have considered two possible classes of
trial wavefunctions, a mean-field single-site one -- whose optimization is
however a very difficult task -- and a Boltzmann-like choice. We performed
GFMC-QA runs using such a Boltzmann-like trial wavefunction, finding results
for the residual energies that are qualitatively similar to those of CA (but at
a much larger computational cost), and definitely worse than PIMC-QA. We
conclude that, at present, without a serious effort in constructing reliable
importance sampling variational wavefunctions for a quantum glass, GFMC-QA is
not a true competitor of PIMC-QA.

to their excellent spectral purity are essential for interrogating atomic
frequency standards at the limit of quantum projection noise; otherwise
aliasing effects will dominate the frequency stability due to the periodic
sampling between successive interrogations of the atomic transition. For this
reason, UWA oscillators are now operational at NMI (Sydney), LNE-SYRTE (Paris),
the French Space Agency (CNES, Toulouse) and at UWA (Perth). Other
applications, which have attracted attention in recent years, include tests on
fundamental principles of physics, such as tests of Lorentz invariance. This

We compare the long-term drift of some different CSOs. The drift rates turn out
to be linear over many years and in the same direction. However, the magnitude
seems to vary by more than one order of magnitude between the oscillators,
ranging from 10^14 per day to a few parts in 10^13 per day.

according to the outcome of the estimate. This semiclassical broadcasting
protocol is more restrictive than a general one, since it requires an
intermediate step where classical information is extracted and processed.
However, we prove that a suboptimal superbroadcasting, namely broadcasting with
simultaneous purification of the local output states with respect to the input
ones, is possible. We show that in the asymptotic limit of $M \to \infty$ the
purification rate converges to the optimal one, proving the conjecture that
optimal broadcasting and state estimation are asymptotically equivalent. We
also show that it is possible to achieve superbroadcasting with simultaneous
inversion of the Bloch vector direction (universal NOT). We prove that in this
case the semiclassical procedure of state estimation and preparation turns out
to be optimal. We finally analyse semiclassical superbroadcasting in the

entropies of a given many-fermion state and the free state that has the same
1-particle statistics. It also equals the relative entropy of the two states in
question, i.e., it is the entropy of the given state relative to the
corresponding free state. The nonfreeness of a pure state is the same as its
&quot;particle-hole symmetric correlation entropy&quot;, a variant of an established
measure of electron correlation. But nonfreeness is also defined for mixed
states, and this allows one to compare the nonfreeness of subsystems to the
nonfreeness of the whole. Nonfreeness of a part does not exceed that in the
whole; nonfreeness is additive over independent subsystems; and nonfreeness is
superadditive over subsystems that are independent on the 1-particle level.

entanglement in ensemble-based quantum computing. This method is based on the
concept of entanglement witness. We decompose the entanglement witness for each
class of multipartite entanglement into nonlocal operations in addition to
local measurements. Individual single qubit measurements are performed
simultaneously, hence complete detection of entanglement is performed in a
single run experiment. This approach is particularly important for experiments
where it is operationally difficult to prepare several copies of an unknown
quantum state and in this sense the introduced scheme in this work is superior
to the generally used entanglement witnesses that require a number of
experiments and preparation of copies of quantum state.

excitation rate of a two-photon absorber on the intensity of the light leaving
the OPA. We find that the rate depends linearly on intensity only for output
beams so weak that they contain fewer than one photon per mode. We also study
the use of an N-photon absorber for arbitrary N as the recording medium to be

quantum states--represent an agent's degrees of belief, rather than
corresponding to objective properties of physical systems. In this paper we
investigate the concept of certainty in quantum mechanics. Particularly, we
show how the probability-1 predictions derived from pure quantum states
highlight a fundamental difference between our Bayesian approach, on the one
hand, and Copenhagen and similar interpretations on the other. We first review
the main arguments for the general claim that probabilities always represent
degrees of belief. We then argue that a quantum state prepared by some physical
device always depends on an agent's prior beliefs, implying that the
probability-1 predictions derived from that state also depend on the agent's
prior beliefs. Quantum certainty is therefore always some agent's certainty.
Conversely, if facts about an experimental setup could imply agent-independent
certainty for a measurement outcome, as in many Copenhagen-like
interpretations, that outcome would effectively correspond to a preexisting
system property. The idea that measurement outcomes occurring with certainty
correspond to preexisting system properties is, however, in conflict with
locality. We emphasize this by giving a version of an argument of Stairs [A.
Stairs, Phil. Sci. 50, 578 (1983)], which applies the Kochen-Specker theorem to
an entangled bipartite system.

have access to (quantum) systems prepared jointly according to a tripartite
state. In addition, Alice and Bob can use local operations and authenticated
public classical communication. Their goal is to establish a key which is
unknown to Eve. We initiate the study of this scenario as a unification of two
standard scenarios: (i) key distillation (agreement) from classical
correlations and (ii) key distillation from pure tripartite quantum states.
  Firstly, we obtain generalisations of fundamental results related to
scenarios (i) and (ii), including upper bounds on the key rate. Moreover, based
on an embedding of classical distributions into quantum states, we are able to
find new connections between protocols and quantities in the standard scenarios
(i) and (ii).
  Secondly, we study specific properties of key distillation protocols. In
particular, we show that every protocol that makes use of pre-shared key can be
transformed into an equally efficient protocol which needs no pre-shared key.
This result is of practical significance as it applies to quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocols, but it also implies that the key rate cannot be
locked with information on Eve's side. Finally, we exhibit an arbitrarily large
separation between the key rate in the standard setting where Eve is equipped
with quantum memory and the key rate in a setting where Eve is only given
classical memory. This shows that assumptions on the nature of Eve's memory are
important in order to determine the correct security threshold in QKD.

explanations have been given not only in terms of the principle of
complementarity and wave-particle duality but also in terms of quantum
consciousness and parallel universes. In this paper, the topic will be
discussed from the perspective of spin-coupling in the hope of further
clarification. We will also suggest that this explanation allows for a realist
interpretation of the Afshar Experiment.

fabricated using a novel high-yield process in which magnetic film patterning
and deposition are combined with cantilever fabrication. These novel devices
have been developed for use as cantilever magnetometers and as force sensors in
nuclear magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM). These two applications have
achieved nanometer-scale resolution using the cantilevers described in this

as magnetometers, is 10^{-15} J/T at room temperature, which is more than a
1000 fold improvement in sensitivity, compared to conventional magnetometers.
Current room temperature force sensitivity of MRFM cantilevers is ~10^{-16} N
in a 1 Hz bandwidth, which is comparable to the room temperature sensitivities
of similar devices of its type. Finite element modeling was used to improve
design parameters, ensure that the devices meet experimental demands, and
correlate mode shape with observed results. The photolithographic fabrication
process was optimized, yielding an average of ~85% and alignment better than

decay rates depend both on the number of correlated spins in the cluster, as
well as on the coherence number. For smaller clusters, the decays depend
strongly on coherence number, but this dependence weakens as the size of the
cluster increases. The same scaling was observed when the coherence

The coherence decay in the one dimensional fluoroapatite system did not change
significantly as a function of the multiple quantum growth time, in contrast to
the calcium fluoride case. While the growth of coherence orders is severely
restricted in this case, the number of correlated spins should continue to
grow, albeit more slowly. All coherence intensities were observed to decay as
Gaussian functions in time. In all cases the standard deviation of the observed

polarization rotation of a weak, linearly-polarized optical (probe) field in an
atomic system with multiple three-level electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) sub-systems. The polarization rotation angle can be
controlled by a circularly-polarized coupling beam, which breaks the symmetry
in number of EIT subsystems seen by the left- and right-circularly-polarized
components of the weak probe beam. A large polarization rotation angle (up to
45 degrees) has been achieved with a coupling beam power of only 15 mW.
Detailed theoretical analyses including different transition probabilities in
different transitions and Doppler-broadening are presented and the results are
in good agreements with the experimentally measured results.

of quantum channels. We consider the asymptotic rates of high fidelity quantum
communication between specific sender-receiver pairs. Four scenarios of
classical communication assistance (none, forward, backward, and two-way) are
considered. (i) We obtain outer and inner bounds of the achievable rate regions
in the most general directed networks. (ii) For two particular networks
(including the butterfly network) routing is proved optimal, and the free
assisting classical communication can at best be used to modify the directions
of quantum channels in the network. Consequently, the achievable rate regions
are given by counting edge avoiding paths, and precise achievable rate regions
in all four assisting scenarios can be obtained. (iii) Optimality of routing
can also be proved in classes of networks. The first class consists of directed
unassisted networks in which (1) the receivers are information sinks, (2) the
maximum distance from senders to receivers is small, and (3) a certain type of
4-cycles are absent, but without further constraints (such as on the number of
communicating and intermediate parties). The second class consists of arbitrary
backward-assisted networks with 2 sender-receiver pairs. (iv) Beyond the k-pair
communication problem, observations are made on quantum multicasting and a
static version of network communication related to the entanglement of

  condensate by an optical lattice: Truncated Wigner approximation</title><description>  We study the splitting of a harmonically trapped atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate when we continuously turn up an optical lattice (or a double-well)
potential. As the lattice height is increased, quantum fluctuations of atoms
are enhanced. The resulting nonequilibrium dynamics of the fragmentation
process of the condensate, the loss of the phase coherence of atoms along the
lattice, and the reduced atom number fluctuations in individual lattice sites
are stochastically studied within the truncated Wigner approximation. We
perform a detailed study of the effects of temperature and lattice height on
atom dynamics, and investigate the validity of the classical Gross-Pitaevskii
equation in optical lattices. We find the atom number squeezing to saturate in
deep lattices due to nonadiabaticity in turning up of the lattice potential
that is challenging to avoid in experiments when the occupation number of the
lattice sites is large, making it difficult to produce strongly number squeezed
(or the Mott insulator) states with large filling factors. We also investigate
some general numerical properties of the truncated Wigner approximation.

domain those signals are carried as voltages and currents on wires, and the
discreteness of the photon's energy is usually not evident. However, by
coupling a superconducting qubit to signals on a microwave transmission line,
it is possible to construct an integrated circuit where the presence or absence
of even a single photon can have a dramatic effect. This system is called
circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) because it is the circuit equivalent of
the atom-photon interaction in cavity QED. Previously, circuit QED devices were
shown to reach the resonant strong coupling regime, where a single qubit can
absorb and re-emit a single photon many times. Here, we report a circuit QED
experiment which achieves the strong dispersive limit, a new regime of cavity
QED in which a single photon has a large effect on the qubit or atom without
ever being absorbed. The hallmark of this strong dispersive regime is that the
qubit transition can be resolved into a separate spectral line for each photon
number state of the microwave field. The strength of each line is a measure of
the probability to find the corresponding photon number in the cavity. This
effect has been used to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields and
could be used to create a photon statistics analyzer. Since no photons are
absorbed by this process, one should be able to generate non-classical states
of light by measurement and perform qubit-photon conditional logic, the basis
of a logic bus for a quantum computer.

most important properties of the entanglement entropy is known as the strong
subadditivity. This requires that the entanglement entropy should be a concave
function with respect to geometric parameters. It is a non-trivial check on the
proposal to see if this property is indeed satisfied by the entropy computed
holographically. In this paper we examine several examples which are defined by
annuli or cusps, and confirm the strong subadditivity via direct calculations.
Furthermore, we conjecture that Wilson loop correlators in strongly coupled
gauge theories satisfy the same relation. We also discuss the relation between
the holographic entanglement entropy and the Bousso bound.

When the generator has only terms associated with few-body couplings, our

characterize surface diffusion and low vibrational motion when having
interacting adsorbates on surfaces. In what we call statistical limit, that is,
at long times and high number of collisions, one expects that diffusing
particles display an essential Markovian behavior. Accordingly, the action of
the pairwise potentials accounting for particle-particle collisions is
equivalent to considering a shot noise acting on a single particle. We call
this approach the interacting single adsorbate approximation, which gathers
three important advantages: (i) the dynamics underlying surface diffusion and
low vibrational motion can be easily understood in terms of relatively simple
stochastic processes; (ii) from our model, appropriate (and well justified)
working formulas are easily obtained, which explain the results arising from
more complicated (but commonly used) molecular dynamics simulations within the
Langevin formulation; and (iii), at the same time, it is less demanding
computationally than the latter type of calculations. In order to illustrate
the application of this model, numerical results are presented. Specially, our
model reproduces the experimental observation regarding the broadening of the
quasielastic peak ruling surface diffusion.

also shown that many features of zitterbewegung are shared by the simple and

consciousness into quantum theory of measurements. Most naturally this is
achieved in the framework of Everett's &quot;many-worlds interpretation&quot; of quantum
mechanics. According to this interpretation, various classical alternatives are
perceived by consciousness separately from each other. In the Extended Everett
Concept (EEC) proposed by the present author, the separation of the
alternatives is identified with the phenomenon of consciousness. This explains
classical character of the alternatives and unusual manifestations of
consciousness arising &quot;at the edge of consciousness&quot; (i.e. in sleep or trance)
when its access to &quot;other alternative classical realities&quot; (other Everett's
worlds) becomes feasible. Because of reversibility of quantum evolution in EEC,
all time moments in the quantum world are equivalent while the impression of
flow of time appears only in consciousness. If it is assumed that consciousness
may influence onto probabilities of alternatives (which is consistent in case
of infinitely many Everett's worlds), EEC explains free will, &quot;probabilistic
miracles&quot; (observing low-probability events) and decreasing entropy in the

qubits with a Hamiltonian composed of nearest-neighbor two-body interactions -
such that the ground state is a universal resource for quantum computation
using single-qubit measurements. This ground state approximates a cluster state
that is encoded into a larger number of physical qubits. The Hamiltonian we use
is motivated by the projected entangled pair states, which provide a
transparent mechanism to produce such approximate encoded cluster states on
square or other lattice structures (as well as a variety of other quantum
states) as the ground state. We show that the error in this approximation takes
the form of independent errors on bonds occurring with a fixed probability. The
energy gap of such a system, which in part determines its usefulness for
quantum computation, is shown to be independent of the size of the lattice. In
addition, we show that the scaling of this energy gap in terms of the coupling
constants of the Hamiltonian is directly determined by the lattice geometry. As
a result, the approximate encoded cluster state obtained on a hexagonal lattice
(a resource that is also universal for quantum computation) can be shown to
have a larger energy gap than one on a square lattice with an equivalent
Hamiltonian.

temporal/spectral ones. Full characterization of photonic states requires state
reconstruction in these additional degrees of freedom. In this paper we present
a technique for performing QST of single photon states in the spectral degree
of freedom. This is of importance, for example, in quantum information
processing applications, which typically impose strict requirements on the
purity and distinguishability of independently produced single photons. The
described technique allows for full reconstruction of the spectral density
matrix, allowing the purity and distinguishability of different sources to be
readily calculated.

quantum superposition of two many-body states with (supposedly) macroscopically
distinct properties, by counting how many single-particle operations are needed
to map one state onto the other. This definition gives sensible results for
simple, analytically tractable cases and is consistent with a previous
definition restricted to Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like states. We apply our
measure to the experimentally relevant, nontrivial example of a superconducting
three-junction flux qubit put into a superposition of left- and
right-circulating supercurrent states and find this Schroedinger cat to be
surprisingly small.

  - A Weak Field Route to Strong Field Coherent Control</title><description>  We present a general and highly efficient scheme for performing narrow-band
Raman transitions between molecular vibrational levels using a coherent train
of weak pump-dump pairs of shaped ultrashort pulses. The use of weak pulses
permits an analytic description within the framework of coherent control in the
perturbative regime, while coherent accumulation of many pulse pairs enables
near unity transfer efficiency with a high spectral selectivity, thus forming a
powerful combination of pump-dump control schemes and the precision of the

application of this concept to the formation of stable, deeply bound, ultracold

quant-ph/0304041), exact formulas are available (both in terms of the
Hilbert-Schmidt and Bures metrics) for the (n^2-1)-dimensional and
(n(n-1)/2-1)-dimensional volumes of the complex and real n x n density
matrices. However, no comparable formulas are available for the volumes (and,
hence, probabilities) of various separable subsets of them. We seek to clarify
this situation for the Hilbert-Schmidt metric for the simplest possible case of
n=4, that is, the two-qubit systems. Making use of the density matrix (rho)
parameterization of Bloore (J. Phys. A 9, 2059 [1976]), we are able to reduce
each of the real and complex volume problems to the calculation of a
one-dimensional integral, the single relevant variable being a certain ratio of
diagonal entries, nu = (rho_{11} rho_{44})/{rho_{22} rho_{33})$. The associated
integrand in each case is the product of a known (highly oscillatory near nu=1)
jacobian and a certain unknown univariate function, which our extensive
numerical (quasi-Monte Carlo) computations indicate is very closely
proportional to an (incomplete) beta function B_{nu}(a,b), with a=1/2,
b=sqrt{3}in the real case, and a=2 sqrt{6}/5, b =3/sqrt{2} in the complex case.
Assuming the full applicability of these specific incomplete beta functions, we
undertake separable volume calculations.

tension is small, the topological order survives. When it is large, it drives a

such physics in systems of photons, however, is problematic, as photons
typically do not interact with each other and can be created or destroyed at
will. Here, we introduce a physical system of photons that exhibits strongly
correlated dynamics on a meso-scale. By adding photons to a two-dimensional
array of coupled optical cavities each containing a single two-level atom in
the photon-blockade regime, we form dressed states, or polaritons, that are
both long-lived and strongly interacting. Our zero temperature results predict
that this photonic system will undergo a characteristic Mott insulator
(excitations localised on each site) to superfluid (excitations delocalised
across the lattice) quantum phase transition. Each cavity's impressive photon
out-coupling potential may lead to actual devices based on these quantum
many-body effects, as well as observable, tunable quantum simulators. We
explicitly show that such phenomena may be observable in micro-machined diamond
containing nitrogen-vacancy colour centres and superconducting microwave
strip-line resonators.

walks is placed in the context of the emerging field of quantum computing.
Constructing a suitable quantum version of a random walk is not trivial: pure
quantum dynamics is deterministic, so randomness only enters during the
measurement phase, i.e., when converting the quantum information into classical
information. The outcome of a quantum random walk is very different from the
corresponding classical random walk, due to interference between the different
possible paths. The upshot is that quantum walkers find themselves further from
their starting point on average than a classical walker, and this forms the
basis of a quantum speed up that can be exploited to solve problems faster.
Surprisingly, the effect of making the walk slightly less than perfectly
quantum can optimize the properties of the quantum walk for algorithmic
applications. Looking to the future, with even a small quantum computer
available, development of quantum walk algorithms might proceed more rapidly
than it has, especially for solving real problems.

can take continuous values, is restricted within some discrete values after a
measurement. As an example of the present theory, in which interplay between
coherence of motion and fluctuation from disturbance plays an important role,
we investigate motion of a spin state in a magnetic field. First, we point out
that discrete eigenstates are formed from continuous states as a result of
coherence of precession motion of a spin. Next, by assuming disturbance from
environmental electromagnetic fields, we investigate temporal change of
direction of a spin state by applying the first order perturbation theory and
the Monte Carlo technique. Results of simulations show that the spins, whose
directions are randomly distributed at the initial time, are reoriented toward
only two directions due to fluctuation guided by coherence.

  beyond</title><description>  A coherent account of the connections and contrasts between the principles of
com- plementarity and uncertainty is developed starting from a survey of the
various formalizations of these principles. The conceptual analysis is
illustrated by means of a set of experimental schemes based on Mach-Zehnder
interferometry. In particu- lar, path detection via entanglement with a probe
system and (quantitative) quan- tum erasure are exhibited to constitute
instances of joint unsharp measurements of complementary pairs of physical
quantities, path and interference observables. The analysis uses the
representation of observables as positive-operator-valued measures (POVMs). The
reconciliation of complementary experimental options in the sense of
simultaneous unsharp preparations and measurements is expressed in terms of
uncertainty relations of different kinds. The feature of complementarity,
manifest in the present examples in the mutual exclusivity of path detection
and interference observation, is recovered as a limit case from the appropriate
uncertainty relation. It is noted that the complementarity and uncertainty
principles are neither completely logically independent nor logical
consequences of one another. Since entanglement is an instance of the
uncertainty of quantum properties (of compound systems), it is moot to play out
uncertainty and entanglement against each other as possible mechanisms
enforcing complementarity.

The algorithm can be used for approximating the twirling operation in an

iteratively, the mean squared error of the approximation decays exponentially.
In contrast, when averaging over random unitary matrices the error decreases

first, we studied the theory of entanglement in its characterization and
measurement, introducing a new scheme for detection of entanglement. The new
approach links molecular-spin entities involving nuclear spins to quantum
computing as more appropriate physical systems of interest. Then, we continued
with the realization of entanglement in experiments. NMR has been the first
choice due to its well approved advantages for quantum computing. NMR, however,
has not been an appropriate system for demonstrating entangled states. Through
a mathematical proof, NMR with low spin polarization has been invalidated for
true implementations of non-local quantum algorithms, particularly supserdense
coding. The point is that high spin polarization is inevitably required to
acquire entanglement while in the current NMR it has been a formidable task to
get highly polarized nuclear spins. In order to acquire high spin polarization,
introducing electron spins can be much effective because of its
three-order-of-magnitude larger gyromagnetic ratio compared to nuclear spins.
Electron Nuclear DOuble Resonance (ENDOR) is spin manipulation technology that
enables us to deal with both electron and nuclear spins. Thus, in this context,
it can be more appropriate device for quantum computing. We emphasize that
(pseudo)entanglement and interconversion between the entangled states have been
realized with ENDOR on extremely stable organic molecular-spin entities. The
required experimental conditions to obtain true quantum entanglement are also
discussed. The appropriate entanglement witness for the corresponding ensemble
quantum computing is introduced and examined.

simple procedure -- based on passive optical elements -- to produce pure
three-mode Gaussian states with {\em arbitrary} entanglement structure (upon
availability of an initial two-mode squeezed state). We analyze in depth the
properties of distributed entanglement and the origin of its sharing structure,
showing that the promiscuity of entanglement sharing is a feature peculiar to
symmetric Gaussian states that survives even in the presence of significant
degrees of mixedness and decoherence. Next, we discuss the suitability of the
considered tripartite entangled states to the implementation of quantum
information and communication protocols with continuous variables. This will
lead to a feasible experimental proposal to test the promiscuous sharing of
continuous-variable tripartite entanglement, in terms of the optimal fidelity
of teleportation networks with Gaussian resources. We finally focus on the
application of three-mode states to symmetric and asymmetric telecloning, and
single out the structural properties of the optimal Gaussian resources for the

viewpoint of our new model of a one-dimensional (1D) completed scattering. Our
study of quantum nonlocality complements those carried out by Volovich and
Khrennikov. They pointed to an unphysical character of nonlocality in Bell's
theorem whose context does not contain the very structure of the space-time.
However, there is another reason leading to nonlocality in QM. The existing
model of a 1D completed scattering evidences that QM, as it stands, even with a
proper space-time context, contradicts special relativity. By our model this
scattering process represents an entanglement of two coherently evolved
alternative sub-processes, transmission and reflection; whose characteristics
are measured well after the scattering event. Quantum nonlocality appears in
this problem due to the inconsistency of the superposition principle with the
corpuscular properties of a particle. It can take part only in one of the
sub-processes. However the superposition principle allows introducing
observables common for them. In the fresh wording, this principle must forbid
introducing observables for entangled states.

operator, together with the subsystem states (reduced density operators),
constitutes the so-called correlated subsystem picture. It is the central part
of the antilinear representation of a bipartite state vector, and it is a kind
of core of its entanglement structure. The generalization of previously
elaborated disentanglement expounded in this article is a synthesis of the
antilinear representation of bipartite state vectors, which is reviewed, and
the relevant results of Cassinelli et al. [J. Math. Analys. and Appl., 210, 472
(1997)] in mathematical analysis, which are summed up. Linearly-independent
bases (finite or infinite) are shown to be almost as useful in some quantum
mechanical studies as orthonormal ones. Finally, it is shown that
linearly-independent remote pure-state preparation carries the highest
probability of occurrence. This singles out linearly-independent remote
influence from all possible ones.

point, but away from this point the decoherence time is greatly reduced by
dephasing. This limits the practical applications of flux qubits. Here we
propose a new qubit design modified from the commonly used flux qubit by
introducing an additional capacitor shunted in parallel to the smaller
Josephson junction (JJ) in the loop. Our results show that the effects of noise
can be considerably suppressed, particularly away from the degeneracy point, by
both reducing the coupling energy of the JJ and increasing the shunt
capacitance. This shunt capacitance provides a novel way to improve the qubit.

interacting spins on a surface. The state space is fixed by a complete set of
quasi-local stabilizer operators and the code dimension depends on the first
homology group of the surface complex. These code states can be actively
stabilized by measurements or, alternatively, can be prepared by cooling to the
ground subspace of a quasi-local spin Hamiltonian. In the case of spin-1/2
(qubit) lattices, such ground states have been proposed as topologically
protected memory for qubits. We extend these constructions to lattices or more
generally cell complexes with qudits, either of prime level or of level
$d^\ell$ for $d$ prime and $\ell \geq 0$, and therefore under tensor
decomposition, to arbitrary finite levels. The Hamiltonian describes an exact
$\mathbb{Z}_d\cong\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}$ gauge theory whose excitations
correspond to abelian anyons. We provide protocols for qudit storage and
retrieval and propose an interferometric verification of topological order by
measuring quasi-particle statistics.

  role of the protein environment and solvent</title><description>  We consider continuum dielectric models as minimal models to understand the
effect of a surrounding globular protein and solvent on the quantum dynamics of
electronic excitations in a biological chromophore. We derive expressions for
the frequency dependent spectral density which describes the coupling of the
electronic levels in the chromophore to its environment. The magnitude and
frequency dependence of the spectral density determines whether or not the
quantum dynamics is coherent or incoherent, and thus whether on not one can
observe quantum interference effects such as Rabi oscillations. We find the
contributions to the spectral density from each component of the chromophore
environment: the bulk solvent, protein, and water bound to the protein. The
relative importance of each component to the quantum dynamics of the
chromophore is determined by the dynamics' time scale. Our results provide a
natural explanation and model for the different time scales observed in the
spectral density extracted from the solvation dynamics probed by ultra-fast
laser spectroscopy techniques such as the dynamic Stokes shift and three pulse
photon echo spectroscopy. Our results are used to define under what conditions
the dynamics of the excited chromophore is dominated by the surrounding protein
and when it is dominated by dielectric fluctuations in the solvent. We show
that even when the chromophore is shielded from the solvent by the protein
ultra-fast solvation can be dominated by the solvent. We suggest that the
ultra-fast solvation recently seen in some biological chromophores should not
necessarily be assigned to ultra-fast protein dynamics. Spectral densities
estimated from our continuum models and extracted from experiment suggest that
most quantum dynamics of electronic excitations is incoherent.

quantum system is a property of the joint density operator, and is achieved by
making particular measurements on the respective components. For pure states it
corresponds to making measurements diagonal in a corresponding Schmidt basis.
More generally, it is shown that the maximum correlation may be characterised
in terms of a `correlation basis' for the joint density operator, which defines
the corresponding (nondegenerate) optimal measurements. The maximum coincidence
rate for spin measurements on two-qubit systems is determined to be (1+s)/2,
where s is the spectral norm of the spin correlation matrix, and upper bounds
are obtained for n-valued measurements on general bipartite systems. It is
shown that the maximum coincidence rate is never greater than the computable
cross norm measure of entanglement, and a much tighter upper bound is
conjectured. Connections with optimal state discrimination and entanglement
bounds are briefly discussed.

entanglement between two particles located? We present a thought-experiment,
equally applicable to discrete or continuous-variable systems, in which one or
both parties makes a preliminary measurement of the state with only enough
resolution to determine whether or not the particle resides in a chosen region,
before attempting to make use of the entanglement. We argue that this provides
an operational answer to the question of how much entanglement was originally
located within the chosen region. We illustrate the approach in a spin system,
and also in a pair of coupled harmonic oscillators. Our approach is
particularly simple to implement for pure states, since in this case the
sub-ensemble in which the system is definitely located in the restricted region
after the measurement is also pure, and hence its entanglement can be simply
characterised by the entropy of the reduced density operators. For our spin
example we present results showing how the entanglement varies as a function of
the parameters of the initial state; for the continuous case, we find also how
it depends on the location and size of the chosen regions. Hence we show that
the distribution of entanglement is very different from the distribution of the
classical correlations.

Quantum observations also can break dynamical symmetries to increase the

states of $N$ atoms trapped in a 1D ring with a barrier at one position and a
phase applied around it. We show how macroscopic superpositions can in

We then use the Bose-Hubbard model to study an array of Bose-Einstein
condensates trapped in optical potentials and coupled to one another to form a
ring. We derive analytic expressions for the quality of the superposition for
this system, which agrees well with direct diagonalisation of the Hamiltonian
for relatively small numbers of atoms. We show that for macroscopic
superpositions to be realised there are essentially three straightforward
requirements, other than an absence of decoherence, which become harder to
achieve as the system size increases. Firstly, the energies of the two distinct
superfluid states must be sufficiently close. Secondly, coupling between the
two states must be sufficiently strong, and thirdly, other states must be well
separated from those participating in the superposition.

measure, and robustness of entanglement. We also show that for our class of
graph states these entanglement values give an operational interpretation as
the maximal number of graph states distinguishable by local operations and
classical communication (LOCC), as well as supplying a tight bound on the fixed
letter classical capacity under LOCC decoding.

three-level atoms in $\Lambda$ configuration. We calculate the stationary
quadrature noise spectrum of the field after propagating through the medium, in
the case where the probe field is in a squeezed state and the atoms show
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). We find an oscillatory transfer
of the initial quantum properties between the probe and pump fields which is
most strongly pronounced when both fields have comparable Rabi frequencies.
This implies that the quantum state measured after propagation can be
completely different from the initial state, even though the mean values of the

measured by the von Neumann entropy of a block of neighboring spins. We study a
double scaling limit: the size of the block is much larger then 1 but much
smaller then the length of the whole chain. The entropy of the block has an
asymptotic limit. We study this limiting entropy as a function of the
anisotropy and of the magnetic field. We identify its minima at product states
and its divergencies at the quantum phase transitions. We find that the curves
of constant entropy are ellipses and hyperbolas and that they all meet at one
point (essential critical point). Depending on the approach to the essential
critical point the entropy can take any value between 0 and infinity. In the
vicinity of this point small changes in the parameters cause large change of
the entropy.

environment can enhance the performance in two different ways: (i) by
introducing a time scale for thermal mixing near the anticrossing that is
smaller than the adiabatic time scale, and (ii) by relaxation after the
anticrossing. The former can enhance the scaling of computation when the

another, cosmological theory, accurate only for the description of subsystems
of the universe. Quantum theory is then to be derived from the cosmological
theory by averaging over variables which are not internal to the subsystem,
which may be considered non-local hidden variables. We find conditions for
arriving at quantum mechanics through such a procedure. The key lesson is that
the effect of the coupling to the external degrees of freedom introduces noise
into the evolution of the system degrees of freedom, while preserving a notion
of averaged conserved energy and time reversal invariance.
  These conditions imply that the effective description of the subsystem is
Nelson's stochastic formulation of quantum theory. We show that Nelson's
formulation is not, by itself, a classical stochastic theory as the conserved
averaged energy is not a linear function of the probability density. We also
investigate an argument of Wallstrom posed against the equivalence of Nelson's
stochastic mechanics and quantum mechanics and show that, at least for a simple

distinguishing coset states in the standard approach to the hidden subgroup
problem. We observe that simply measuring the partition (a procedure we call
weak Schur sampling) provides very little information about the hidden
subgroup. Furthermore, we show that under quite general assumptions, even a

the hidden subgroup. We also prove tight bounds on how many coset states are

Schrodinger equation to spinors, so the Pauli equation must be derived from the
Dirac equation by taking its non-relativistic limit. Hence, it predicts the
existence of an intrinsic magnetic moment for the electron and gives its
correct value. In the scale relativity framework, the Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon
and Dirac equations have been derived from first principles as geodesics
equations of a non-differentiable and continuous spacetime. Since such a
generalized geometry implies the occurence of new discrete symmetry breakings,
this has led us to write Dirac bi-spinors in the form of bi-quaternions
(complex quaternions). In the present work, we show that, in scale relativity
also, the correct Pauli equation can only be obtained from a non-relativistic
limit of the relativistic geodesics equation (which, after integration, becomes
the Dirac equation) and not from the non-relativistic formalism (that involves
symmetry breakings in a fractal 3-space). The same degeneracy procedure, when
it is applied to the bi-quaternionic 4-velocity used to derive the Dirac
equation, naturally yields a Pauli-type quaternionic 3-velocity. It therefore
corroborates the relevance of the scale relativity approach for the building
from first principles of the quantum postulates and of the quantum tools. This
also reinforces the relativistic and fundamentally quantum nature of spin,
which we attribute in scale relativity to the non-differentiability of the
quantum spacetime geometry (and not only of the quantum space). We conclude by
performing numerical simulations of spinor geodesics, that allow one to gain a
physical geometric picture of the nature of spin.

  retain entanglement in coin space</title><description>  In most widely discussed discrete time quantum walk model, after every
unitary shift operator, the particle evolves into the superposition of position
space and settles down in one of its basis states, loosing entanglement in the
coin space in the new position. The Hadamard operation is applied to let the
particle to evolve into the superposition in the coin space and the walk is
iterated. We present a model with a additional degree of freedom for the
unitary shift operator $U^{\prime}$. The unitary operator with additional
degree of freedom will evolve the quantum particle into superposition of
position space retaining the entanglement in coin space. This eliminates the
need for quantum coin toss (Hadamard operation) after every unitary
displacement operation as used in most widely studied version of the discrete
time quantum walk model. This construction is easily extended to a multiple
particle quantum walk and in this article we extend it for a pair of particles
in pure state entangled in coin degree of freedom by simultaneously subjecting
it to a pair of unitary displacement operators which were constructed for
single particle. We point out that unlike for single particle quantum walk,
upon measurement of its position after $N$ steps, the entangled particles are
found together with 1/2 probability and at different positions with 1/2
probability. This can act as an advantage in applications of the quantum walk.
A special case is also treated using a complex physical system such as, inter
species two-particle entangled Bose-Einstein condensate, as an example.

Here we analyse the parity gate (P-gate) from a theoretical point of view in

generation with P-gates and show that native networks simplify considerably the
resources required for producing multi-qubit entanglement, like n-GHZ states.
Other applications include a Bell-state analyser and teleportation. We also
show that cluster state fusion can be performed deterministically with parity

(spin-mode entanglement of single electrons) we show how to produce a spin
n-GHZ state with linear elements (beam-splitters and local spin-flips) and
charge-parity detectors; this state can be used as a resource in a spin quantum
computer or as a precursor for constructing cluster states. Finally, we
construct a novel spin CZ-gate by using the mode degrees of freedom as
ancillae.

difference between the wells, or tilt, causes the decoherence of Schrodinger
cat states. However, these states reappear when the tilt can be compensated by
atom-atom interactions; these tilted cat states constitute partial cats that

of an N-electron classical kinetic energy and an N-electron purely quantum
kinetic energy arising from the quantum fluctuations that turn the classical
momentum into the quantum momentum. This leads to an interesting analogy with
Nelson's stochastic approach to quantum mechanics, which we use to conceptually
clarify the physical nature of part of the kinetic-energy functional in terms
of statistical fluctuations and in direct correspondence with Fisher
Information Theory. We show that the N-electron purely quantum kinetic energy
can be written as the sum of the (one-electron) Weizsacker term and an
(N-1)-electron kinetic correlation term. We further show that the Weizsacker
term results from local fluctuations while the kinetic correlation term results
from the nonlocal fluctuations. For one-electron orbitals (where kinetic
correlation is neglected) we obtain an exact (albeit impractical) expression
for the noninteracting kinetic energy as the sum of the classical kinetic
energy and the Weizsacker term. The classical kinetic energy is seen to be
explicitly dependent on the electron phase and this has implications for the
development of accurate orbital-free kinetic-energy functionals. Also, there is
a direct connection between the classical kinetic energy and the angular

component of the noninteracting kinetic energy generally increases as Z

efficient model to study multiparticle entanglement, but also find wide
applications in quantum error correction, multi-party quantum communication and
most prominently, serve as the central resource in one-way quantum computation.
Here we report the creation of two special instances of graph states, the
six-photon Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states -- the largest photonic
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger cat, and the six-photon cluster states-- a state-of-the-art
one-way quantum computer. Flexibly, slight modifications of our method allow
creation of many other graph states. Thus we have demonstrated the ability of
entangling six photons and engineering multiqubit graph states, and created a
test-bed for investigations of one-way quantum computation and studies of
multiparticle entanglement as well as foundational issues such as nonlocality
and decoherence.

  massive particles</title><description>  We consider the question of whether it is possible to use the entanglement
between spatially separated modes of massive particles to observe nonlocal
quantum correlations. Mode entanglement can be obtained using a single
particle, indicating that it requires careful consideration before concluding
whether experimental observation, e.g. violation of Bell inequalities, is
possible or not. In the simplest setups analogous to optics experiments, that
observation is prohibited by fundamental conservation laws. However, we show
that using auxiliary particles, mode entanglement can be converted into forms
that allow the observation of quantum non-locality. The probability of
successful conversion depends on the nature and number of auxiliary particles
used. In particular, we find that an auxiliary Bose-Einstein condensate allows
the conversion arbitrarily many times with a small error that depends only on
the initial state of the condensate.

intensities of light pulses. Existing theory has assumed exact control of
intensities. Here we propose a simple protocol which is secure and efficient
even there are errors in intensity control. In our protocol, decoy pulses and
signal pulses are generated from the same father pulses with a two-value
attenuation. Given the upper bound of fluctuation of the father pulses, our
protocol is secure provided that the two-value attenuation is done exactly. We
propose to use unbalanced beam-splitters for a stable attenuation. Given that
the intensity error is bounded by $\pm5%$, with the same key rate, our method
can achieve a secure distance only 1 km shorter than that of an ideal protocol
with exactly controlled source.

within the framework of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) must perform highly
entangled measurements across Omega(n log n) coset states. One of the only
known models for how such a measurement could be carried out efficiently is
Kuperberg's algorithm for the HSP in the dihedral group, in which quantum
states are adaptively combined and measured according to the decomposition of
tensor products into irreducible representations. This ``quantum sieve'' starts
with coset states, and works its way down towards representations whose
probabilities differ depending on, for example, whether the hidden subgroup is
trivial or nontrivial.
  In this paper we give strong evidence that no such approach can succeed for
Graph Isomorphism. Specifically, we consider the natural reduction of Graph
Isomorphism to the HSP over the the wreath product S_n \wr Z_2. We show, modulo
a group-theoretic conjecture regarding the asymptotic characters of the
symmetric group, that no matter what rule we use to adaptively combine quantum
states, there is a constant b &gt; 0 such that no algorithm in this family can
solve Graph Isomorphism in e^{b sqrt{n}} time. In particular, such algorithms
are essentially no better than the best known classical algorithms, whose
running time is e^{O(sqrt{n \log n})}.

fringes in experiments where an initial Gaussian wave packet evolves inside a

previous work by Casati and Prosen and it is aimed to test their surprising
conclusion that the fringes disappear in the experiments with fully chaotic
billiards. According to the results found, we are led to reassess this
remarkable effect of classical dynamics on quantum interference. Actually, we
highlight another factor which acts on interference: a symmetry condition (SC)
concerning the experimental set-up. This condition seems even to play a role
more important than classical chaos. Indeed, when the SC is verified, classical
chaos has no effect, whereas when the SC is violated classical chaos turns out
to be an additional factor that causes dephasing at the slits. We explain the
respective roles of these two factors, by specifying the physical mechanism
through which they influence the interference patterns. This mechanism depends
both on the position and direction of the initial wave packet and on certain
its recurrences which occur especially in the regular billiards.

In the standard quantum circuit model with the gate set $\{\U(2),

N},i,j=0,1,..., N-1, \omega=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{N}}$, can be realized exactly by
quantum circuits of size $O(n^2), n=\textrm{log}N$, and so can the discrete

universal topological quantum computer is based on the Fibonacci
(2+1)-topological quantum field theory (TQFT), where the standard quantum
circuits are replaced by unitary transformations realized by braiding conformal

ultracold alkali atoms forming a homonuclear diatomic is investigated using
realistic atomic interaction potentials. Confinement of the initial atom pair
due to the trap leads to a uniform strong enhancement of the photoassociation
rate to most, but also to a strongly suppressed rate for some final states.
Thus tighter traps do not necessarily enhance the photoassociation rate. A
further massive enhancement of the rate is found for strong interatomic
interaction potentials. The details of this interaction play a minor role,
except for large repulsive interactions for which a sharp window occurs in the
photoassociation spectrum as is known from the trap-free case. A comparison
with simplified models describing the atomic interaction like the
pseudopotential approximation shows that they often provide reasonable
estimates for the trap-induced enhancement of the photoassociation rate even if
the predicted rates can be completely erroneous.

many of the accepted quantum features. In this new work, novel solutions to
Maxwell's classical equations in dispersive guides are considered where local
helical twists with an arbitrary angular frequency W modulate a classical mode
(angular frequency w, group velocity vg). The modal field patterns are
unchanged, apart from the twist, provided that the helical velocity vh equals
vg. Pairs of resonating retarded and advanced waves with modal and helical
frequencies (w,W) and (w,-W)respectively, trap one temporal period of the
underlying classical mode forming a photon-like packet provided W = (M+1/2)w:
'Schrodinger' frequencies. This theory supports experimental evidence that the
photon velocity does not change with M in dispersive systems. Promotion and
demotion increase or decrease the helical frequencies in units of w. An energy
of interaction between retarded and advanced waves in the wave-packet is also
proportional to these helical frequencies W = (M+1/2)w similar to Planck's law.
Group velocity and polarisation are unaffected by the value of M. Advanced
waves enable phase and polarisation to be predicted along all future paths and
may help to explain the outcomes of experiments on delayed-choice interference
and entanglement, without causality being violated.

defining uncertainty in either position x or momentum u. The convolution arises
naturally out of the approach, and is one-dimensional, in comparison with the

users is often plagued by a number of &quot;myths&quot;, that is, widely accepted claims
on which there is not really a general consensus among experts in foundations
of QM. These myths include wave-particle duality, time-energy uncertainty
relation, fundamental randomness, the absence of measurement-independent
reality, locality of QM, nonlocality of QM, the existence of well-defined
relativistic QM, the claims that quantum field theory (QFT) solves the problems
of relativistic QM or that QFT is a theory of particles, as well as myths on
black-hole entropy. The fact is that the existence of various theoretical and
interpretational ambiguities underlying these myths does not yet allow us to
accept them as proven facts. I review the main arguments and counterarguments
lying behind these myths and conclude that QM is still a
not-yet-completely-understood theory open to further fundamental research.

  Let t_i be the number of time steps required to evaluate the i-th item. If

fundamental laws in physics. Its application to microphysics allows us to
recover quantum mechanics as mechanics on a non-differentiable (fractal)
spacetime. The Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations are demonstrated as
geodesic equations in this framework. A development of the intrinsic properties
of this theory, using the mathematical tool of Hamilton's bi-quaternions, leads
us to a derivation of the Dirac equation within the scale-relativity paradigm.
The complex form of the wavefunction in the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon
equations follows from the non-differentiability of the geometry, since it
involves a breaking of the invariance under the reflection symmetry on the
(proper) time differential element (ds &lt;-&gt; - ds). This mechanism is generalized
for obtaining the bi-quaternionic nature of the Dirac spinor by adding a
further symmetry breaking due to non-differentiability, namely the differential
coordinate reflection symmetry (dx^mu &lt;-&gt; - dx^mu) and by requiring invariance
under parity and time inversion. The Pauli equation is recovered as a
non-relativistic-motion approximation of the Dirac equation.

control and quantum information processing applications. Here, we investigate
how single-bit, discrete-time feedback capabilities may be exploited to enact
or to enhance quantum procedures for effectively suppressing unwanted dynamics

the joint unitary propagators correctable by a single-bit feedback strategy for
arbitrary evolution time is obtained. For a two-dimensional target system, we
show how by appropriately combining quantum feedback with dynamical decoupling
methods, concatenated feedback-decoupling schemes may be built, which can
operate under relaxed control assumptions and can outperform purely closed-loop

unknown state taken from an ensemble, the task is to generate a bipartite state
transfering as much Holevo-information to each copy as possible.
  We argue that upper bounds on the average information over both copies imply
lower bounds on the quantum capacity required to send the ensemble without
information loss. This is because a channel with zero quantum capacity has a
unitary extension transfering at least as much information to its environment
as it transfers to the output.
  For an ensemble being the time orbit of a pure state under a Hamiltonian
evolution, we derive such a bound on the required quantum capacity in terms of
properties of the input and output energy distribution. Moreover, we discuss
relations between the broadcasting problem and entropy power inequalities.
  The broadcasting problem arises when a signal should be transmitted by a
time-invariant device such that the outgoing signal has the same timing
information as the incoming signal had. Based on previous results we argue that
this establishes a link between quantum information theory and the theory of
low power computing because the loss of timing information implies loss of free
energy.

  Broglie-Bohm and classical dynamics in semiclassical systems</title><description>  The de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics aims to give a
realist description of quantum phenomena in terms of the motion of point-like
particles following well-defined trajectories. This work is concerned by the de
Broglie-Bohm account of the properties of semiclassical systems. Semiclassical
systems are quantum systems that display the manifestation of classical
trajectories: the wavefunction and the observable properties of such systems
depend on the trajectories of the classical counterpart of the quantum system.
For example the quantum properties have a regular or disordered aspect
depending on whether the underlying classical system has regular or chaotic
dynamics. In contrast, Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems have
little in common with the trajectories of the classical counterpart, creating a
dynamical mismatch relative to the quantum-classical correspondence visible in
these systems. Our aim is to describe this mismatch (explicit illustrations are
given), explain its origin, and examine some of the consequences on the status
of Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems. We argue in particular that
semiclassical systems put stronger constraints on the empirical acceptability
and plausibility of Bohmian trajectories because the usual arguments given to
dismiss the mismatch between the classical and the de Broglie-Bohm motions are
weakened by the occurrence of classical trajectories in the quantum
wavefunction of such systems.

  entanglement: Promiscuous quantum correlations arising from discrete to
  continuous variable systems</title><description>  Quantum mechanics imposes 'monogamy' constraints on the sharing of
entanglement. We show that, despite these limitations, entanglement can be
fully 'promiscuous', i.e. simultaneously present in unlimited two-body and
many-body forms in states living in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.
Monogamy just bounds the divergence rate of the various entanglement
contributions. This is demonstrated in simple families of N-mode (N &gt;= 4)
Gaussian states of light fields or atomic ensembles, which therefore enable
infinitely more freedom in the distribution of information, as opposed to
systems of individual qubits. Such a finding is of importance for the
quantification, understanding and potential exploitation of shared quantum
correlations in continuous variable systems. We discuss how promiscuity
gradually arises when considering simple families of discrete variable states,
with increasing Hilbert space dimension towards the continuous variable limit.
Such models are somehow analogous to Gaussian states with asymptotically
diverging, but finite squeezing. In this respect, we find that non-Gaussian
states (which in general are more entangled than Gaussian states), exhibit also
the interesting feature that their entanglement is more shareable: in the
non-Gaussian multipartite arena, unlimited promiscuity can be already achieved
among three entangled parties, while this is impossible for Gaussian, even
infinitely squeezed states.

reconciled if an appropriate trade-off is accepted. The uncertainty principle

relations: for the widths of the position and momentum distributions in any
quantum state; for the inaccuracies of any joint measurement of these
quantities; and for the inaccuracy of a measurement of one of the quantities
and the ensuing disturbance in the distribution of the other quantity. Whilst
conceptually distinct, these three kinds of uncertainty relations are shown to
be closely related formally. Finally, we survey models and experimental
implementations of joint measurements of position and momentum and comment

following only a tiny fraction of the variables necessary for a perfectly
fine-grained description. Coarse graining in classical physics is made natural
by our limited powers of observation and computation. But in the modern quantum
mechanics of closed systems, some measure of coarse graining is inescapable
because there are no non-trivial, probabilistic, fine-grained descriptions.
This essay explores the consequences of that fact. Quantum theory allows for
various coarse-grained descriptions some of which are mutually incompatible.
For most purposes, however, we are interested in the small subset of
``quasiclassical descriptions'' defined by ranges of values of averages over
small volumes of densities of conserved quantities such as energy and momentum
and approximately conserved quantities such as baryon number. The
near-conservation of these quasiclassical quantities results in approximate
decoherence, predictability, and local equilibrium, leading to closed sets of
equations of motion. In any description, information is sacrificed through the
coarse graining that yields decoherence and gives rise to probabilities for
histories. In quasiclassical descriptions, further information is sacrificed in
exhibiting the emergent regularities summarized by classical equations of
motion. An appropriate entropy measures the loss of information. For a
``quasiclassical realm'' this is connected with the usual thermodynamic entropy
as obtained from statistical mechanics. It was low for the initial state of our
universe and has been increasing since.

permanent of a matrix or the volume of a polytope) work by reduction to the
problem of approximate sampling from a distribution $\pi$ over a large set
$\S$. This problem is solved using the {\em Markov chain Monte Carlo} method: a
sparse, reversible Markov chain $P$ on $\S$ with stationary distribution $\pi$
is run to near equilibrium. The running time of this random walk algorithm, the
so-called {\em mixing time} of $P$, is $O(\delta^{-1} \log 1/\pi_*)$ as shown
by Aldous, where $\delta$ is the spectral gap of $P$ and $\pi_*$ is the minimum
value of $\pi$. A natural question is whether a speedup of this classical
method to $O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}} \log 1/\pi_*)$, the diameter of the graph
underlying $P$, is possible using {\em quantum walks}.
  We provide evidence for this possibility using quantum walks that {\em
decohere} under repeated randomized measurements. We show: (a) decoherent
quantum walks always mix, just like their classical counterparts, (b) the
mixing time is a robust quantity, essentially invariant under any smooth form
of decoherence, and (c) the mixing time of the decoherent quantum walk on a
periodic lattice $\Z_n^d$ is $O(n d \log d)$, which is indeed
$O(\sqrt{\delta^{-1}} \log 1/\pi_*)$ and is asymptotically no worse than the
diameter of $\Z_n^d$ (the obvious lower bound) up to at most a logarithmic
factor.

  multiphoton resonance condition</title><description>  The light propagation of a probe field pulse in a four-level double-lambda
type system driven by laser fields that form a closed interaction loop is
studied. Due to the finite frequency width of the probe pulse, a
time-independent analysis relying on the multiphoton resonance assumption is
insufficient. Thus we apply a Floquet decomposition of the equations of motion
to solve the time-dependent problem beyond the multiphoton resonance condition.
We find that the various Floquet components can be interpreted in terms of
different scattering processes, and that the medium response oscillating in
phase with the probe field in general is not phase-dependent. The phase
dependence arises from a scattering of the coupling fields into the probe field
mode at a frequency which in general differs from the probe field frequency. We
thus conclude that in particular for short pulses with a large frequency width,
inducing a closed loop interaction contour may not be advantageous, since
otherwise the phase-dependent medium response may lead to a distortion of the
pulse shape. Finally, using our time-dependent analysis, we demonstrate that
both the closed-loop and the non-closed loop configuration allow for sub- and
superluminal light propagation with small absorption or even gain. Further, we
identify one of the coupling field Rabi frequencies as a control parameter that
allows to conveniently switch between sub- and superluminal light propagation.

  Principles and Application to Quantum Dense Coding and Quantum Secure Direct

codes(one-party-QECC), a novel idea for correcting unbalanced quantum errors.
In some quantum communication tasks using entangled pairs, the error
distributions between two parts of the pairs are unbalanced, and. one party
holds the whole entangled pairs at the final stage, and he or she is able to
perform joint measurements on the pairs. In this situation the proposed
one-party-QECC can improve error correction by allowing a higher tolerated
error rate. We have established the general correspondence between linear
classical codes and the one-party-QECC, and we have given the general
definition for this type quantum error correcting codes.It has been shown that
the one-party-QECC can correct errors as long as the error threshold is not
larger than 0.5. The one-party-QECC works even for fidelity less than 0.5 as
long as it is larger than 0.25. We give several concrete examples of the
one-party-QECC. We provide the applications of one-party-QECC in quantum dense
coding so that it can function in noisy channels. As a result, a large number
of quantum secure direct communication protocols based on dense coding is also
able to be protected by this new type of one-party-QECC.

power and slightly diverging laser beam optimizes the transfer between the two
traps when its frequency is red-detuned from the atomic transition. This
pushing laser extracts a continuous beam of slow and cold atoms out of the
first MOT and also provides a guiding to the second one through the dipolar
force. In order to optimize the transfer efficiency, the dependence of the
atomic flux on the pushing laser parameters (power, detuning, divergence and
waist) is investigated. The atomic flux is found to be proportional to the
first MOT loading rate. Experimentally, the transfer efficiency reaches 70%,
corresponding to a transfer rate up to 2.7x10^8 atoms/s with a final velocity

fail as an autonomous quantum method when infinite potential walls are present.
The stationary physical Wigner functions do not satisfy the normal eigen
equations, the *-eigen equations, unless an ad hoc boundary potential is added
[Dias-Prata]. Alternatively, they satisfy a different, higher-order,
``*-eigen-* equation'', locally, i.e. away from the walls [Kryukov-Walton].
Here we show that this substitute equation can be written in a very simple
form, even in the presence of an additional, arbitrary, but regular potential.
The more general applicability of the -eigen- equation is then demonstrated.
First, using an idea from [Fairlie-Manogue], we extend it to a dynamical
equation describing time evolution. We then show that also for general contact
interactions, the -eigen- equation is satisfied locally. Specifically, we treat
the most general possible (Robin) boundary conditions at an infinite wall,
general one-dimensional point interactions, and a finite potential jump.
Finally, we examine a smooth potential, that has simple but different
expressions for x positive and negative. We find that the -eigen- equation is
again satisfied locally. It seems, therefore, that the -eigen- equation is
generally relevant to the matching of Wigner functions; it can be solved
piece-wise and its solutions then matched.

Both approaches require single photon counting detectors, and best results are
obtained by combining cavity-feedback with twin-fock inputs. Such an approach

our understanding of the basics of quantum theory. The knowledge of the
implications of the quantum theory to other theories, especially to the
statistical mechanics and the domain of validity has captivated scientists from
the beginning of quantum description. In such a context, the presence of an
environment is commonly thought as entanglement, decohering and mixing
properties of quantum system. Generically, an environment is assumed to be a
noisy reservoir or a heat bath. Whereas in common interpretation of statistical
mechanics the heat bath is unspecified, in quantum systems a heat bath can also
provide an indirect interaction between otherwise totally decoupled subsystems
and consequently a means to entangle them \cite{cdkl,dvclp,bfp}. In simple
example for the entanglement between two qubits due to the interaction with a
common heat bath has been explicitly shown in \cite{b}. Whereas in that paper
the bath is described by a collection of harmonic oscillators, it seems to be
more reasonable to specify the bath by stochastic forces represented by
stochastic fields. From a more general point of view we expect the bath should
be better described in a stochastic manner and not by deterministic forces. In
the present paper we consider a two level system (qubits) which are able to
perform flip processes by a coupling to classical stochastic fields. Thus we
bridge the gap between quantum and classical probability theory. This problem
is related to many other questions of quantum optics and quantum electronics
where quantum statistical aspects arising from the intrinsic quantum character
of the system while the possible time-dependence of system parameters may be
interpreted as the influence of classical thermal fluctuations.

  O(4) Symmetry</title><description>  A common quark potential that captures the essential traits of the QCD
quark-gluon dynamics is expected to (i) interpolate between a Coulomb-like
potential (associated with one-gluon exchange) and the infinite wall potential
(associated with trapped but asymptotically free quarks), (ii) reproduce in the
intermediary region the linear confinement potential (associated with
multi-gluon self-interactions) as established by lattice QCD calculations of
hadron properties. We first show that the exactly soluble trigonometric
Rosen-Morse potential possesses all these properties. Next we observe that this
potential, once interpreted as angular momentum dependent, acquires a dynamical
O(4) symmetry and reproduces exactly quantum numbers and level splittings of
the non-strange baryon spectra in the SU(2)_I* O(4) classification scheme
according to which baryons cling on to multi-spin parity clusters of the type
(K/2,K/2)*[(1/2,0) + (0, 1/2)], whose relativistic image is
\psi_{\mu_{1}...\mu_{K}}. Finally, we bring exact energies and wave functions
of the levels within the above potential and thus put it on equal algebraic
footing with such common potentials of wide spread as are the
harmonic-oscillator- and the Coulomb potentials.

are nonphysical in nature through the existence of incomparable pure bipartite
entangled states. It is also shown that a large class of
inner-product-preserving operations defined only on the three qubits having
spin-directions along x, y and z are impossible. If we perform such an
operation locally on a particular pure bipartite state then it will exactly
transform to another pure bipartite state that is incomparable with the
original one. As subcases of the above results we find the nonphysical nature

Beyond the information conservation in terms of entanglement, this work shows

quantum copying machines. The graphic representation by diagrams of states
offers a clear and detailed visualization of quantum information's flow during
the unitary evolution of not too complex systems. The diagrams of states are
exponentially more complex in respect to the standard representation and this
clearly illustrates the discrepancy of computational power between quantum and
classical systems. After a brief introductive exposure of the general theory,
we present a constructive procedure to illustrate the new representation by
means of concrete examples. Elementary diagrams of states for single-qubit and
two-qubit systems and a simple scheme to represent entangled states are
presented. Quantum copying machines as imperfect cloners of quantum states are
introduced and the quantum copying machines of Griffiths and Niu and of Buzek
and Hillery are analyzed, determining quantum circuits of easier
interpretation. The method has indeed shown itself to be extremely successful
for the representation of the involved quantum operations and it has allowed to

is termed \emph{scalar} if the internal space of the moving particle (often
called the coin) has a dimension one. Here, we study the existence of scalar
quantum walks on Cayley graphs, which are built from the generators of a group.
After deriving a necessary condition on these generators for the existence of a
scalar quantum walk, we present a general method to express the evolution
operator of the walk, assuming homogeneity of the evolution. We use this
necessary condition and the subsequent constructive method to investigate the
existence of scalar quantum walks on Cayley graphs of various groups presented
with two or three generators. In this restricted framework, we classify all
groups -- in terms of relations between their generators -- that admit scalar
quantum walks, and we also derive the form of the most general evolution
operator. Finally, we point out some interesting special cases, and extend our
study to a few examples of Cayley graphs built with more than three generators.

qubits in atomic ensembles and linear optics has been proposed [Nature 414, 413

improved performance in the presence of experimental inefficiencies. Our

impossible in both the classical and the quantum world. However, when
committing to a string of n bits at once, how far can we stretch the quantum
limits? In this letter, we introduce a framework of quantum schemes where Alice
commits a string of n bits to Bob, in such a way that she can only cheat on a
bits and Bob can learn at most b bits of information before the reveal phase.
Our results are two-fold: we show by an explicit construction that in the
traditional approach, where the reveal and guess probabilities form the
security criteria, no good schemes can exist: a+b is at least n. If, however,
we use a more liberal criterion of security, the accessible information, we
construct schemes where a=4 log n+O(1) and b=4, which is impossible
classically. Our findings significantly extend known no-go results for quantum
bit commitment.

  Interacting with a common Electromagnetic Field</title><description>  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a pair of qubits made of two-level
atoms separated in space with distance r and interacting with one common
electromagnetic field but not directly with each other. Our calculation makes a
weak coupling assumption, but no Born or Markov approximation. We derived a
non-Markovian master equation for the evolution of the reduced density matrix
of the two-qubit system after integrating out the electromagnetic field modes.
It contains a Markovian part with a Lindblad type operator and a nonMarkovian
contribution, the physics of which is the main focus of this study. We use the
concurrence function as a measure of quantum entanglement between the two
qubits. Two classes of states are studied in detail: Class A is a one parameter
family of states which are the superposition of the highest energy and Class B
states are linear combinations of the symmetric and the antisymmetric Bell
states. We obtain similar behavior for the Bell states as in earlier results
derived by using the Born-Markov approximation. However, in the Class A states
the behavior is qualitatively different: under the non-Markovian evolution we
do not see sudden death of quantum entanglement and subsequent revivals, except
when the qubits are sufficiently far apart. We provide explanations for such
differences of behavior both between these two classes of states and between
the predictions from the Markov and non-Markovian dynamics. We also study the
decoherence of this two-qubit system and find that the decoherence rate in the
case of one qubit initially in an excited state does not change significantly
with the qubits separation whereas it does for the case when one qubit is
initially in the ground state.

fields and the tunneling times involved are probably too large for practical
implementations. On the other hand, operations with double donors in their
first excited state require smaller fields and faster tunneling times, and are
therefore suitable for spin-to-charge conversion measurements. We also propose
a measurement scheme that would render statistical (ensemble) estimates of the
spin coherence at the Si/SiO2 interface.

an atomic vapor cell. A significantly broad cavity response over a bandwidth
greater than 20 MHz has been observed. The experimental results agree well with

additional measures for mechanical stability. The results also establish
indirectly the opposite effect of enhanced sensitivity that can be realized for
a negative dispersion corresponding to a group index close to a null value.
This enhancement in turn can be employed to increase significantly the

quantum information that stands to regular quantum information in the same way
that a direction in space or a moment in time stands to a classical bit string:
the former can only be encoded using particular degrees of freedom while the
latter are indifferent to the physical nature of the information carriers. The
problem of correlating distant reference frames, of which aligning Cartesian
axes and synchronizing clocks are important instances, is an example of a task
that requires the exchange of unspeakable information and for which it is
interesting to determine the fundamental quantum limit of efficiency. There
have also been many investigations into the information theory that is
appropriate for parties that lack reference frames or that lack correlation
between their reference frames, restrictions that result in global and local
superselection rules. In the presence of these, quantum unspeakable information
becomes a new kind of resource that can be manipulated, depleted, quantified,
etcetera. Methods have also been developed to contend with these restrictions
using relational encodings, particularly in the context of computation,
cryptography, communication, and the manipulation of entanglement. This article

need three quite feasible innovations in quantum mechanics (QM): (1) at the
conceptual level, QM must treat a pure time-dependent one-particle state to
involve two or more macroscopically distinct alternatives for a particle as a
pure {\it combined} one - the intermediate link between a pure {\it elementary}
state (indecomposable into macroscopically distinct parts) and statistical
mixture; (2) at the mathematical level, QM must provide the presentation of the
pure time-dependent combined state as a coherent superposition of
macroscopically distinct elementary states (MDESs); (3) at the experimental
level, QM must provide for such states two types of measurements - those for
observing the interference pattern resulting from the joint action of MDESs,
and non-demolishing 'which-way' measurements for scanning the individual
properties of MDESs.

quantum emitter and a single radiation-field mode. When an atom is in strong
coupling with a cavity mode1,2, it is possible to realize key quantum
information processing (QIP) tasks, such as controlled coherent coupling and
entanglement of distinguishable quantum systems. Realizing these tasks in the
solid state is clearly desirable, and coupling semiconductor self-assembled
quantum dots (QDs) to monolithic optical cavities is a promising route to this
end. However, validating the efficacy of QDs in QIP applications requires
confirmation of the quantum nature of the QD-cavity system in the strong
coupling regime. Here we find a confirmation by observing quantum correlations
in photoluminescence (PL) from a photonic crystal (PC) nanocavity3-5
interacting with one, and only one, QD located precisely at the cavity electric
field maximum. When off-resonance, photon emission from the cavity mode and QD
excitons is anti-correlated at the level of single quanta, proving that the
mode is driven solely by the QD despite an energy mis-match between cavity and
excitons. When tuned into resonance, the exciton and photon enter the
strong-coupling regime of cavity-QED and the QD lifetime reduces by a factor of
120. The photon stream from the cavity becomes anti-bunched, proving that the
coupled exciton/photon system is in the quantum anharmonic regime. Our
observations unequivocally show that QIP tasks requiring the quantum nonlinear
regime are achievable in the solid state.

composite objects, whose dissociation is suppressed by a band gap. Nearly pure
samples of such repulsively bound pairs of cold atoms -- &quot;dimers&quot; -- have
recently been prepared by Winkler et al. [Nature 441, 853 (2006)]. We here
derive an effective Hamiltonian for a lattice loaded with dimers only and
discuss its implications to the many-body dynamics of the system. We find that
the dimer-dimer interaction includes strong on-site repulsion and
nearest-neighbor attraction which always dominates over the dimer kinetic
energy at low temperatures. The dimers then form incompressible,
minimal-surface &quot;droplets&quot; of a quantum lattice liquid. For low lattice
filling, the effective Hamiltonian can be mapped onto the spin-1/2 XXZ model
with fixed total magnetization which exhibits a first-order phase transition
from the &quot;droplet&quot; to a &quot;gas&quot; phase. This opens the door to studying first
order phase transitions using highly controllable ultracold atoms.

  Algebraic Classification and Gradient-Flow-Based Numerical Checks</title><description>  Generalising in the sense of Hahn's spin echo, we completely characterise
those unitary propagators of effective multi-qubit interactions that can be
inverted solely by {\em local} unitary operations on $n$ qubits
(spins-$\tfrac{1}{2}$). The subset of $U\in \mathbf{SU}(2^n)$ satisfying
$U^{-1}=K_1 U K_2$ with pairs of local unitaries $K_1,
K_2\in\mathbf{SU}(2)^{\otimes n}$ comprises two classes: in type-I, $K_1$ and
$K_2$ are inverse to one another, while in type-II they are not. {Type-I}
consists of one-parameter groups that can jointly be inverted for all times
$t\in\R{}$ because their Hamiltonian generators satisfy $K H K^{-1} = \Ad K (H)
= -H$. As all the Hamiltonians generating locally invertible unitaries of
type-I are spanned by the eigenspace associated to the eigenvalue -1 of the
{\em local} conjugation map $\Ad K$, this eigenspace can be given in closed
algebraic form. The relation to the root space decomposition of
$\mathfrak{sl}(N,\C{})$ is pointed out. Special cases of type-I invertible
Hamiltonians are of $p$-quantum order and are analysed by the transformation
properties of spherical tensors of order $p$. Effective multi-qubit interaction
Hamiltonians are characterised via the graphs of their coupling topology.
  {Type-II} consists of pointwise locally invertible propagators, part of which
can be classified according to the symmetries of their matrix representations.
Moreover, we show gradient flows for numerically solving the decision problem
whether a propagator is type-I or type-II invertible or not by driving the
least-squares distance $\norm{K_1 e^{-itH} K_2 - e^{+itH}}^2_2$ to zero.

all orders are presented. The absorption features is studied in two regimes, i)
the weak middle transition coupling, i.e.
  $\Omega_2 &lt;&lt; \Omega_{1,3}$ and ii) the strong middle transition coupling
  $\Omega_2 &gt;&gt;\Omega_{1,3}$. In case i), it is shown that the ground state
absorption and the saturation characteristics of the population of level 2
reveal deviation due to the presence of upper level couplings. In particular,
the saturation curve for the population of level 2 shows a dip for $\Omega_1 =
\Omega_3$. While the populations of levels 3 and 4 show a maxima when this
resonance condition is satisfied. Thus the resonance condition provides a
criterion for maximally populating the upper levels. A second order
perturbation calculation reveals the nature of this minima (maxima). In the
second case, I report two important features: a) Filtering of the Aulter-Townes
doublet in the three-peak absorption profile of the ground state, which is
achieved by detuning only the upper most coupling field, and b) control of
line-width by controlling the strength of the upper coupling fields. This
filtering technique coupled with the control of linewidth could prove to be
very useful for high resolution studies.

lost at a time of 0.2 nanoseconds after the bias current pulse has been
applied. A timescale which is much shorter than the experimental readout time.
Additionally we look at the effect of Johnson-Nyquist noise with zero mean from
the current source during the qubit manipulation and show that the decoherence
due to the irreversible bias current description is an order of magnitude
smaller than that found through adding noise to the reversible tilted washboard
potential model. Our irreversible bias current model is also applicable to the
persistent current based qubits where the state is measured according to its
flux via a small inductance direct current superconducting quantum interference
device (DC-SQUID).

 By introducing a Chebyshev mesh and using the Nystrom algorithm the singular

continually shifting non-relational modalities, time remains as tenseless and
relational as space in all of the established theories of fundamental physics.
Here an empirically adequate generalized theory of the inertial structure is
discussed in which proper time is causally compelled to be tensed within both
spacetime and dynamics. This is accomplished by introducing the inverse of the
Planck time at the conjunction of special relativity and Hamiltonian mechanics,
which necessitates energies and momenta to be invariantly bounded from above,
and lengths and durations similarly bounded from below, by their respective
Planck scale values. The resulting theory abhors any form of preferred
structure, and yet captures the transience of now along timelike worldlines by
causally necessitating a genuinely becoming universe. This is quite unlike the
scenario in Minkowski spacetime, which is prone to a block universe
interpretation. The minute deviations from the special relativistic effects
such as dispersion relations and Doppler shifts predicted by the generalized
theory remain quadratically suppressed by the Planck energy, but may
nevertheless be testable in the near future, for example via observations of
oscillating flavor ratios of ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos, or of altering
pulse rates of extreme energy binary pulsars.

across multiple independently erred quantum systems. Recently it was realized
that, since the most general method for encoding quantum information is to
encode it into a subsystem, there exists a novel form of quantum error
correction beyond the traditional quantum error correcting subspace codes.
These new quantum error correcting subsystem codes differ from subspace codes
in that their quantum correcting routines can be considerably simpler than
related subspace codes. Here we present a class of quantum error correcting
subsystem codes constructed from two classical linear codes. These codes are
the subsystem versions of the quantum error correcting subspace codes which are
generalizations of Shor's original quantum error correcting subspace codes. For
every Shor-type code, the codes we present give a considerable savings in the

electrical currents is incident on a photo-detector, the photo-current does not
fluctuate much. Precisely, this means that the variance of the number of
photo-electrons counted over a large time interval is much smaller that the
average number of photo-electrons. At non-zero Fourier frequency $\Omega$ the
photo-current power spectrum is of the form $\Omega^2/(1+\Omega^2)$ and thus
vanishes as $\Omega\to 0$, a conclusion equivalent to the one given above. The
purpose of this paper is to show that results such as the one just cited may be
derived from a (semi-classical) theory in which neither the optical field nor
the electron wave-function are quantized. We first observe that almost any
medium may be described by a circuit and distinguish (possibly non-linear)
conservative elements such as pure capacitances, and conductances that
represent the atom-field coupling. The theory rests on the non-relativistic
approximation. Nyquist noise sources (in which the Planck term $\hbar\omega/2$
is being restored) are associated with positive or negative conductances, and
the law of average-energy conservation is enforced. We consider mainly
second-order correlations in stationary linearized regimes.

for any definition of quantum Kolmogorov complexity measuring the number of
classical bits required to describe a pure quantum state, there exists a pure
n-qubit state which requires exponentially many bits of description. This is
shown by relating the classical communication complexity to the quantum
Kolmogorov complexity. Furthermore we give some examples of how quantum
Kolmogorov complexity can be applied to prove results in different fields, such
as quantum computation and thermodynamics, and we generalize it to the case of
mixed quantum states.

for long-range quantum communication. We show that the communication distance
is limited in standard operation mode due to memory errors resulting from
unavoidable waiting times for classical signals. We show how to overcome these
limitations by (i) improving local memory, and (ii) introducing two new
operational modes of the quantum repeater. In both operational modes, the
repeater is run blindly, i.e. without waiting for classical signals to arrive.
In the first scheme, entanglement purification protocols based on one-way
classical communication are used allowing to communicate over arbitrary
distances. However, the error thresholds for noise in local control operations
are very stringent. The second scheme makes use of entanglement purification
protocols with two-way classical communication and inherits the favorable error
thresholds of the repeater run in standard mode. One can increase the possible
communication distance by an order of magnitude with reasonable overhead in
physical resources. We outline the architecture of a quantum repeater that can
possibly ensure intercontinental quantum communication.

solid-state quantum information processing. While all-optical spin measurements
using Faraday rotation has been successfully implemented in ensembles of
semiconductor spins, read-out of a single semiconductor spin has only been
achieved using transport measurements based on spin-charge conversion. Here, we
demonstrate an all-optical dispersive measurement of the spin-state of a single
electron trapped in a semiconductor quantum dot. We obtain information on the
spin state through conditional Faraday rotation of a spectrally detuned optical
field, induced by the polarization- and spin-selective trion (charged quantum
dot) transitions. To assess the sensitivity of the technique, we use an
independent resonant laser for spin-state preparation. An all-optical
dispersive measurement on single spins has the important advantage of
channeling the measurement back-action onto a conjugate observable, thereby
allowing for repetitive or continuous quantum nondemolition (QND) read-out of
the spin-state. We infer from our results that there are of order unity
back-action induced spin-flip Raman scattering events within our measurement
timescale. Therefore, straightforward improvements such as the use of a
solid-immersion lens and higher efficiency detectors would allow for
back-action evading spin measurements, without the need for a cavity.

  There is the variant of AP which solutions are free of arising singularities
if D=5; in this case AP acquires topological features of nonlinear sigma-model.
Starting with topological charge, one can also introduce the topological
quasi-charge groups for field configurations having some symmetry. For 4D,
considering symmetrical equipped 0-(sub)manifolds in R^3, we find QC-groups for
some symmetries (subsets of O_3) and describe their morphisms. Differential
3-form of topological charge (dual to topological current) is derived, as well
as O_3-quasi-charge 1-form.
  Results of topological classification of symmetric configurations in 5D case
(alighting on evident parallels with the Standard Model combinatorics of
fundamental particles) are announced. An example of SO_2-symmetric
configuration is considered; (quasi-)charge forms (self-dual and
anti-self-dual) are obtained.
  In conclusion, we propose a variant of experiment with single photon

The kinematical cornerstone of our framework is the so called polymer

continuum Hamiltonian can be represented and that is unitarily equivalent to
the Schroedinger representation of quantum mechanics. As a concrete

transitions due to a breakdown of the adiabatic approximation. Several papers
have studied this process for atoms with spin $F = 1/2$ or $F= 1$. The present
paper calculates the escape rate for atoms with spin $F &gt; 1$. This problem has
new features because the perturbation $\Delta T$ which allows atoms to escape
satisfies a selection rule $\Delta F_z = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2$ and multi-step
processes contribute in leading order. When the adiabatic approximation is
satisfied the leading order terms can be summed to yield a simple expression
for the escape rate.

The schemes require only local operations and classical communication, they
have the advantage of transmitting the two output states directly to two

show further that we can perform the same one-qubit operation with unity

  trapped atoms</title><description>  When two indistinguishable single photons are fed into the two input ports of
a beam splitter, the photons will coalesce and leave together from the same
output port. This is a quantum interference effect, which occurs because the
two possible paths where the photons leave in different output ports interfere
destructively. This effect was first observed in parametric downconversion by
Hong, Ou and Mandel, and then with single photons produced one after the other
by the same quantum emitter. With the recent development of quantum
information, a lot of attention has been devoted to this coalescence effect as
a resource for quantum data processing using linear optics techniques. To
ensure the scalability of schemes based on these ideas, it is crucial that
indistinguishable photons are emitted by a collection of synchronized, but
otherwise independent sources. In this paper, we demonstrate the quantum
interference of two single photons emitted by two independently trapped single
atoms, bridging the gap towards the simultaneous emission of many
indistinguishable single photons by different emitters. Our data analysis shows
that the coalescence observed is mostly limited by the wavefront matching of
the light emitted by the two atoms, and to a lesser extent by the motion of
each atom in its own trap.

squeezing function. We show that by controlling the wavelength dependence of
its phase it is possible to change the dynamics of the atomic polarization
interacting with the squeezed vacuum. Such a phase modulation effectively
produces a finite range temporal interaction kernel between the two quadratures
of the atomic polarization yielding the change in the decay rates as well as
the appearance of additional oscillation frequencies. We show that decay rates
slower than the spontaneous decay rate can be achieved even for a squeezed bath
in the classic regime. For linear and quadratic phase modulations the power
spectrum of the scattered light exhibits narrowing of the central peak due to
the modified decay rates. For strong phase modulations side lobes appear
symmetrically around the central peak reflecting additional oscillation

  matter qubits and bright coherent light</title><description>  We describe a system for long-distance distribution of quantum entanglement,
in which coherent light with large average photon number interacts dispersively
with single, far-detuned atoms or semiconductor impurities in optical cavities.
Entanglement is heralded by homodyne detection using a second bright light
pulse for phase reference. The use of bright pulses leads to a high success
probability for the generation of entanglement, at the cost of a lower initial
fidelity. This fidelity may be boosted by entanglement purification techniques,
implemented with the same physical resources. The need for more purification
steps is well compensated for by the increased probability of success when
compared to heralded entanglement schemes using single photons or weak coherent
pulses with realistic detectors. The principle cause of the lower initial
fidelity is fiber loss; however, spontaneous decay and cavity losses during the
dispersive atom/cavity interactions can also impair performance. We show that
these effects may be minimized for emitter-cavity systems in the weak-coupling
regime as long as the resonant Purcell factor is larger than one, the cavity is
over-coupled, and the optical pulses are sufficiently long. We support this
claim with numerical, semiclassical calculations using parameters for three
realistic systems: optically bright donor-bound impurities such as 19-F:ZnSe
with a moderate-Q microcavity, the optically dim 31-P:Si system with a high-Q
microcavity, and trapped ions in large but very high-Q cavities.

relative errors of the order of 10^(-8) and 10^(-4) respectively. Next, we use
it to study the ground state properties of the quantum rotor model in one
spatial dimension, a model that can be mapped to the Mott insulator limit of
the 1-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model. At the quantum critical point, the
central charge associated to the underlying conformal field theory can be
computed with good accuracy by measuring the finite-size corrections of the
ground state energy. Examples of MPS-computations both in the finite-size
regime and in the thermodynamic limit are given. The precision of our results
are found to be comparable to those previously encountered in the MPS studies
of, for instance, quantum spin chains. Finally, we present a spin-off
application: an iterative technique to efficiently get numerical solutions of
partial differential equations of many variables. We illustrate this technique
by solving Poisson-like equations with precisions of the order of 10^(-7).

This approach gives a reformulation of the past results of adiabatic,

identified uniquely as the holonomy associated with the hidden local gauge
symmetry which is an exact symmetry of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation. The

  This thesis addresses two known quantities in quantum information science:
(1) entanglement cost, and (2) Holevo capacity. These quantities will be
crucial values when teleportation becomes common in daily life, perhaps
centuries from now.
  Assume that Alice desires to send a singing Japanese cricket to her friend
Bob in America, and that Alice and Bob already share a quantum entanglement.
First, Alice sends Bob a mass of information bits resulting from the
interaction between the cricket she holds in her hand and half of the
entanglement. Subsequently, Bob receives the information bits and manipulates
the other half of the entanglement, transforming them back into the original
cricket. Examining this situation from an instrumental engineering viewpoint,
quantifying the amount of the quantum entanglement and the number of
information bits is crucial for this transmission. If both values are enough,
Alice could even send herself to Bob's place instead of the tiny cricket.
  The topics of this thesis therefore are: (1) the mathematical properties of
the entanglement cost, such as whether it is an additive measure similar to
normal length or weight; and (2) how to calculate the Holevo capacity, an
ultimately achievable limit of the information conveyance capacity of an
information channel, such as of a single photon passing through an optical
fiber or space. These two distinct quantities are magically tied together by
several ``additive or not'' hypotheses, which await mathematical proof.

  black-body radiation</title><description>  It is shown that the energy of a mode of a classical chaotic field, following
the continuous exponential distribution as a classical random variable, can be
uniquely decomposed into a sum of its fractional part and of its integer part.
The integer part is a discrete random variable (we call it Planck variable)
whose distribution is just the Bose distribution yielding the Planck law of
black-body radiation. The fractional part is the dark part (we call is dark
variable) with a continuous distribution, which is, of course, not observed in
the experiments. It is proved that the Bose distribution is infinitely
divisible, and the irreducible decomposition of it is given. The Planck
variable can be decomposed into an infinite sum of independent binary random
variables representing the binary photons (more accurately photo-molecules or
photo-multiplets) of energies 2^s*h*nu with s=0,1,2... . These binary photons
follow the Fermi statistics. Consequently, the black-body radiation can be
viewed as a mixture of statistically and thermodynamically independent fermion
gases consisting of binary photons. The binary photons give a natural tool for
the dyadic expansion of arbitrary (but not coherent) ordinary photon
excitations. It is shown that the binary photons have wave-particle
fluctuations of fermions. These fluctuations combine to give the wave-particle
fluctuations of the original bosonic photons expressed by the Einstein
fluctuation formula.

the Froehlich interaction between electrons and phonons. The latter is
investigated using non-commuting phonon creation/annihilation operators
associated with a natural set of non-orthogonal modes. This setting proves
effective for mathematical simplification and physical interpretation and
reveals a nested coupling structure of the Froehlich interaction. The theory is
non-perturbative and well adapted for strong electron-phonon coupling, such as
found in quantum dot (QD) structures. For those particular structures we
introduce a minimal model that allows the computation and qualitative
prediction of the spectrum and geometry of polarons. The model uses a generic
non-orthogonal polaron basis, baptized the &quot;natural basis&quot;. Accidental and
symmetry-related electronic degeneracies are studied in detail and are shown to
generate unentangled zero-shift polarons, which we consistently eliminate. As a
practical example, these developments are applied to realistic pyramidal GaAs
QDs. The energy spectrum and the 3D-geometry of polarons are computed and
analyzed, and prove that realistic pyramidal QDs clearly fall in the regime of
strong coupling. Further investigation reveals an unexpected substructure of
&quot;weakly coupled strong coupling regimes&quot;, a concept originating from overlap
considerations. Using Bennett's entanglement measure, we finally propose a
heuristic quantification of the coupling strength in QDs.

through an unravelling of the master equation. First, this is done through
continuous measurement of the position of each system. Second, and perhaps
somewhat surprisingly, we demonstrate that we still obtain a very good match

-\Delta + V$ with a potential $V(x)$ converging to different limits $V_{\ell}$

anisotropy they exhibit a two-channel structure. We first establish the
existence and properties of the channel wave and scattering operators by using
the modern Mourre approach. We then use scattering theory to show the identity
of two apparently different representations of time delay. The first one is
defined in terms of sojourn times while the second one is given by the
Eisenbud-Wigner operator. The identity of these representations is well known
for systems where $V(x)$ vanishes as $|x| \to \infty$ ($V_\ell = V_r$). We show
that it remains true in the anisotropic case $V_\ell \not = V_r$, i.e. we prove
the existence of the time-dependent representation of time delay and its
equality with the time-independent Eisenbud-Wigner representation. Finally we
use this identity to give a time-dependent interpretation of the
Eisenbud-Wigner expression which is commonly used for time delay in the

  nonrandom phases</title><description>  We prove the security of the Bennett-Brassard (BB84) quantum key distribution
protocol in the case where the key information is encoded in the relative phase
of a coherent-state reference pulse and a weak coherent-state signal pulse, as
in some practical implementations of the protocol. In contrast to previous
work, our proof applies even if the eavesdropper knows the phase of the
reference pulse, provided that this phase is not modulated by the source, and
even if the reference pulse is bright. The proof also applies to the case where
the key is encoded in the photon polarization of a weak coherent-state pulse
with a known phase, but only if the phases of the four BB84 signal states are
judiciously chosen. The achievable key generation rate scales quadratically
with the transmission in the channel, just as for BB84 with phase-randomized
weak coherent-state signals (when decoy states are not used). For the case
where the phase of the reference pulse is strongly modulated by the source, we
exhibit an explicit attack that allows the eavesdropper to learn every key bit
in a parameter regime where a protocol using phase-randomized signals is
provably secure.

  Rate from Quantumly Corrupted Codewords</title><description>  Given a classical error-correcting block code, the task of quantum list
decoding is to produce from any quantumly corrupted codeword a short list
containing all messages whose codewords exhibit high &quot;presence&quot; in the
quantumly corrupted codeword. Efficient quantum list decoders have been used to
prove a quantum hardcore property of classical codes. The code rates of all
known families of efficiently quantum list-decodable codes, unfortunately, are
too small for other practical applications. To improve those known code rates,
we prove that a specific code family of polynomially small code rate over a
fixed code alphabet, obtained by concatenating generalized Reed-Solomon codes
as outer codes with Hadamard codes as inner codes, has an efficient quantum
list-decoding algorithm if its codewords have relatively high codeword presence
in a given quantumly corrupted codeword. As an immediate application, we use
the quantum list decodability of this code family to solve a certain form of
quantum search problems in polynomial time. When codeword presence becomes
arbitrarily smaller, however, we show that the quantum list decodability of
generalized Reed-Solomon codes with high confidence is closely related to the
efficient solvability of the following two problems: noisy polynomial
interpolation problems and bounded distance vector problems. Moreover, assuming
that NP is not included in BQP, we prove that there is no efficient quantum
list decoder for the generalized Reed-Solomon codes.

quantum dot molecules (QDMs) made of dissimilar dots (heteropolar QDMs) with
QDMs made of identical dots (homopolar QDMs). The calculations show that the
electronic structures of hetero-QDMs and homo-QDMs differ significantly at
large inter-dot distance. In particular (i) Unlike those of homo-QDMs, the
single-particle molecular orbitals of hetero-QDMs convert to dot localized
orbitals at large inter-dot distance. (ii) Consequently, in a hetero-QMD the
bonding-antibonding splitting of molecular orbitals at large inter-dot distance
is significantly larger than the electron hopping energy whereas for homo-QDM,
the bonding-antibonding splitting is very similar to the hopping energy. (iii)
The asymmetry of the QDM increases significantly the double occupation for the

wave approximation are considered. Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian is
performed exactly, leading to useful spectral decompositions of a series of
relevant operators. The latter include ladder operators acting between adjacent
energy eigenstates within two separate infinite discrete towers, except for a
singleton state. These ladder operators allow for the construction of
(p,q)-deformed vector coherent states. Using (p,q)-arithmetics, explicit and
exact solutions to the associated moment problem are displayed, providing new
classes of coherent states for such models. Finally, in the limit of decoupled
spin sectors, our analysis translates into (p,q)-deformations of the
supersymmetric harmonic oscillator, such that the two supersymmetric sectors
get intertwined through the action of the ladder operators as well as in the

properties through decoherence when their wavelengths become larger than the
Hubble scale. Although decoherence is effective, it is not complete, so a
significant part of primordial correlations remains up to the present moment.
We address the issue of the pointer states which provide a classical basis for
the fluctuations with respect to the influence by an environment (other
fields). Applying methods from the quantum theory of open systems (the Lindblad
equation), we show that this basis is given by narrow Gaussians that
approximate eigenstates of field amplitudes. We calculate both the von Neumann
and linear entropy of the fluctuations. Their ratio to the maximal entropy per
field mode defines a degree of partial decoherence in the entropy sense. We
also determine the time of partial decoherence making the Wigner function
positive everywhere which, for super-Hubble modes during inflation, is
virtually independent of coupling to the environment and is only slightly
larger than the Hubble time. On the other hand, assuming a representative
environment (a photon bath), the decoherence time for sub-Hubble modes is
finite only if some real dissipation exists.

alternative to the more familiar quantal formalism based on state-vectors,
selfadjoint operators, and external observers. Mathematically one generalizes
the path-integral-as-propagator to a {\it quantal measure} $\mu$ on the space
$\Omega$ of all ``conceivable worlds'', and this generalized measure expresses
the dynamics or law of motion of the theory, much as Wiener measure expresses
the dynamics of Brownian motion. Within such ``histories-based'' schemes new,
and more ``realistic'' possibilities open up for resolving the philosophical
problems of the state-vector formalism. In particular, one can dispense with
the need for external agents by locating the predictive content of $\mu$ in its
sets of measure zero: such sets are to be ``precluded''. But unrestricted
application of this rule engenders contradictions. One possible response would
remove the contradictions by circumscribing the application of the preclusion
concept. Another response, more in the tradition of ``quantum logic'', would
accommodate the contradictions by dualizing $\Omega$ to a space of
``co-events'' and effectively identifying reality with an element of this dual
space.

equation has two linearly independent solutions one of which is normalisable
while the other is not. In the domain after the last node of a boundstate
eigenfunction the unnormalisable linearly independent solution has a simple
form which enables the construction of functions analogous to Green's functions
that lead to certain sum rules. One set of sum rules give conditions that must
be satisfied at the nodes and extrema of the boundstate eigenfunctions of
confining potentials. Another sum rule establishes a relation between an
integral involving an eigenfunction in the domain after the last node and a sum
involving all the eigenvalues and eigenstates. Such sum rules may be useful in
the study of properties of confining potentials. The exactly solvable cases of
the particle in a box and the simple harmonic oscillator are used to illustrate
the procedure. The relations between one of the sum rules and two-particle

where the excited state of a laser-driven transition is coupled by a second
laser to a top, more stable level, as for alkali-earth atoms. The second laser
action modifies the atomic scattering cross section and produces temperatures
lower than those reached by Doppler cooling on the lower transition. When
multiphoton processes due to the second laser are relevant, an electromagnetic
induced transparency modifies the absorption of the first laser, and the final

  Mechanics</title><description>  Some of the so-called imponderables and counterintuitive puzzles associated
with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics appear to have
alternate, parallel explanations in terms of nonlinear dynamics and chaos.
These include the mocking up of exponetial decay in closed systems, possible
nonlinear extensions of Bell's inequalities, spontaneous symmetry breaking and
the existence of intrinsically preferred internal oscillation modes
(quantization) in nonlinear systems, and perhaps even the production of
diffraction-like patterns by &quot;order in chaos.&quot; The existence of such parallel
explanations leads to an empirical, quasi-experimental approach to the question
of whether or not there might be fundamental nonlinearities underying quantum
mechanics. This will be contrasted with recent more theoretical approaches, in
which nonlinear extensions have been proposed rather as corrections to a
fundamentally linear quantum mechanics. Sources of nonlinearity, such as
special relativity and the measurement process itself, will be investigated, as
will possible implications of nonlinearities for entanglement and decoherence.
It is conceivable that in their debates both Einstein and Bohr could have been
right -- for chaos provides the fundamental determinism favored by Einstein,
yet for practical measurements it requires the probabilistic interpretation of
the Bohr school.

  Walks on Sparse Graphs</title><description>  We describe two BQP-complete problems concerning properties of sparse graphs
having a certain symmetry. The graphs are specified by efficiently computable
functions which output the adjacent vertices for each vertex. Let i and j be
two given vertices. The first problem consists in estimating the difference
between the number of paths of length m from j to j and those which from i to
j, where m is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices. The scale of the
estimation accuracy is specified by some a priori known upper bound on the
growth of these differences with increasing m. The problem remains BQP-hard for
regular graphs with degree 4.
  The second problem is related to continuous-time classical random walks. The
walk starts at some vertex j. The promise is that the difference of the
probabilities of being at j and at i, respectively, decays with O(exp(-\mu t))
for some \mu&gt;0. The problem is to decide whether this difference is greater
than a exp(-\mu T) or smaller than b exp(-\mu T) after some time instant T,
where T is polylogarithmic and the difference a-b is inverse polylogarithmic in
the number of vertices. Since the probabilities differ only by an exponentially
small amount, an exponential number of trials would be necessary if one tried
to answer this question by running the walk itself.
  A modification of this problem, asking whether there exists a pair of nodes
for which the probability difference is at least a exp(-\mu T), is
QCMA-complete.

existence of certain correlations in quantum systems that have no classical
interpretation. It is a useful resource to enhance the mutual information of
memory channels or to accelerate some quantum processes as, for example, the
factorization in Shor's Algorithm. Moreover, entanglement is a physical
observable directly measured by the von Neumann entropy of the system. We have
used this concept in order to give a physical meaning to the electron
correlation energy in systems of interacting electrons. The electronic
correlation is not directly observable, since it is defined as the difference
between the exact ground state energy of the many--electrons Schroedinger
equation and the Hartree--Fock energy. We have calculated the correlation
energy and compared with the entanglement, as functions of the nucleus--nucleus
separation using, for the hydrogen molecule, the Configuration Interaction
method. Then, in the same spirit, we have analyzed a dimer of ethylene, which
represents the simplest organic conjugate system, changing the relative
orientation and distance of the molecules, in order to obtain the configuration
corresponding to maximum entanglement.

the phase phi(E) defined by r(E) = t*(E)/t(E) = 1e^{i 2phi(E)} undergoes a
rapid change of pi radians. During this transition the phase angle exhibits a
Lorentzian profile in that d(phi(E))/dE ~= 1/[(E-E_0)^2+(hbar*gamma/2)^2]. The
energy E_0 identifies the location of a quasi-bound state, gamma measures the
lifetime of this state, and t(E) is a matrix element of the transfer operator.

either the interferometer is \textit{closed} (\textit{i.e.} the two paths are
recombined) and the interference is observed, or the interferometer remains
\textit{open} and the path followed by the photon is measured. We report an
almost ideal realization of that GedankenExperiment, where the light pulses are
true single photons, allowing unambiguous which-way measurements, and the
interferometer, which has two spatially separated paths, produces high
visibility interference. The choice between measuring either the 'open' or
'closed' configuration is made by a quantum random number generator, and is
space-like separated -- in the relativistic sense -- from the entering of the
photon into the interferometer. Measurements in the closed configuration show
interference with a visibility of 94%, while measurements in the open
configuration allow us to determine the followed path with an error probability
lower than 1%.

excitation energies. Such systems naturally arise when expanding collective
spin Hamiltonians at leading order via the Holstein-Primakoff mapping. In a
second step, we analyze several such models (the Dicke model, the two-level BCS
model, the Lieb-Mattis model and the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model) and
investigate the properties of the entanglement entropy in the whole parameter
range. We show that when the system contains gapless excitations the
entanglement entropy of the ground state diverges with increasing system size.
We derive and classify the scaling behaviors that can be met.

  condensate model</title><description>  We study a three-mode Hamiltonian modelling a heteronuclear molecular
Bose--Einstein condensate. Two modes are associated with two distinguishable
atomic constituents, which can combine to form a molecule represented by the
third mode. Beginning with a semi-classical analogue of the model, we conduct
an analysis to determine the phase space fixed points of the system.
Bifurcations of the fixed points naturally separate the coupling parameter
space into different regions. Two distinct scenarios are found, dependent on
whether the imbalance between the number operators for the atomic modes is zero
or non-zero. This result suggests the ground-state properties of the model
exhibit an unusual sensitivity on the atomic imbalance. We then test this
finding for the quantum mechanical model. Specifically we use Bethe ansatz
methods, ground-state expectation values, the character of the quantum
dynamics, and ground-state wavefunction overlaps to clarify the nature of the
ground-state phases. The character of the transition is smoothed due to quantum
fluctuations, but we may nonetheless identify the emergence of a quantum phase
boundary in the limit of zero atomic imbalance.

  and local/global models of computation</title><description>  In the past few years there has been a tumultuous activity aimed at
introducing novel conceptual schemes for quantum computing. The approach
proposed in (Marzuoli A and Rasetti M 2002, 2005a) relies on the (re)coupling
theory of SU(2) angular momenta and can be viewed as a generalization to
arbitrary values of the spin variables of the usual quantum-circuit model based
on `qubits' and Boolean gates. Computational states belong to
finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces labelled by both discrete and continuous
parameters, and unitary gates may depend on quantum numbers ranging over finite
sets of values as well as continuous (angular) variables. Such a framework is
an ideal playground to discuss discrete (digital) and analogic computational
processes, together with their relationships occuring when a consistent
semiclassical limit takes place on discrete quantum gates. When working with
purely discrete unitary gates, the simulator is naturally modelled as families
of quantum finite states--machines which in turn represent discrete versions of
topological quantum computation models. We argue that our model embodies a sort
of unifying paradigm for computing inspired by Nature and, even more
ambitiously, a universal setting in which suitably encoded quantum symbolic
manipulations of combinatorial, topological and algebraic problems might find
their `natural' computational reference model.

observed using entanglement witnesses which are themselves constructed within
the framework of thermodynamics and thus macroscopic observables. These
thermodynamical entanglement witnesses result in bounds on macroscopic
parameters of the system, such as the temperature, the energy or the
susceptibility, below which entanglement must be present. The derived bounds
indicate a relationship between the occurrence of entanglement and the
establishment of order, possibly resulting in phase transition phenomena. We
give a short overview over the concepts developed in condensed matter physics
to capture the characteristics of phase transitions in particular in terms of
order and correlation functions. Finally we want to ask and speculate whether
entanglement could be a generalised order concept by itself, relevant in
(quantum induced) phase transitions such as BEC, and that taking this view may
help us to understand the underlying process of high-T superconductivity.

implement control of quantum systems protected against decoherence via
informational encodings, such as quantum error correcting codes, noiseless
subsystems and decoherence free subspaces. These encodings lead to the promise
of fault tolerant QIP, but they come at the expense of resource overheads.
  Part of the challenge in studying control over multiple logical qubits, is
that QIP test-beds have not had sufficient resources to analyze encodings
beyond the simplest ones. The most relevant resources are the number of
available qubits and the cost to initialize and control them. Here we
demonstrate an encoding of logical information that permits the control over
multiple logical qubits without full initialization, an issue that is
particularly challenging in liquid state NMR. The method of subsystem
pseudo-pure state will allow the study of decoherence control schemes on up to
6 logical qubits using liquid state NMR implementations.

establish a bound on the number of graph states which are neither isomorphic

  Also, we study graph states in non-binary case. We translate the action of

  Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to verify whether two graph

a key obtained from QC for authentication purposes in later rounds of QC. In
particular, the eavesdropper gains partial knowledge on the key in QC that may
have an effect on the security of the authentication in the later round. Our
initial analysis indicates that this partial knowledge has little effect on the
authentication part of the system, in agreement with previous results on the
issue. However, when taking the full QC protocol into account, the picture is
different. By accessing the quantum channel used in QC, the attacker can change
the message to be authenticated. This, together with partial knowledge of the
key, does incur a security weakness of the authentication. The underlying
reason for this is that the authentication used, which is insensitive to such
message changes when the key is unknown, becomes sensitive when used with a
partially known key. We suggest a simple solution to this problem, and stress
usage of this or an equivalent extra security measure in QC.

three-levels superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) with the
help of an auxiliary SQUID. In this scenario, two three-levels systems are
coupled to a quantized cavity field and a classical external field and thus
form dark states. The quantum entanglement can be produced by a quantum
measurement on the auxiliary SQUID. Our investigation emphasizes the quantum
effect of the auxiliary SQUID. For the experimental feasibility and

quantum entanglement, relations between the measurement time and dominate

  distances</title><description>  Entanglement distribution between trapped-atom quantum memories, viz. single
atoms in optical cavities, is addressed. In most scenarios, the rate of
entanglement distribution depends on the efficiency with which the state of
traveling single photons can be transferred to trapped atoms. This loading
efficiency is analytically studied for two-level, $V$-level, $\Lambda$-level,
and double-$\Lambda$-level atomic configurations by means of a system-reservoir
approach. An off-resonant non-adiabatic approach to loading $\Lambda$-level
trapped-atom memories is proposed, and the ensuing trade-offs between the
atom-light coupling rate and input photon bandwidth for achieving a high
loading probability are identified. The non-adiabatic approach allows a broad
class of optical sources to be used, and in some cases it provides a higher
system throughput than what can be achieved by adiabatic loading mechanisms.
The analysis is extended to the case of two double-$\Lambda$ trapped-atom
memories illuminated by a polarization-entangled biphoton.

quantum relativistic kinematics generated by fifteen generators. It is obtained
from imposing stability conditions after attempting to combine the Lie algebras
of quantum mechanics and relativity which by themselves are stable, however not
when combined. In this paper we show how the sixteen dimensional Clifford
algebra CL(1,3) can be used to generate the SPHA. The Clifford algebra path to
the SPHA avoids the traditional stability considerations, relying instead on
the fact that CL(1,3) is a semi-simple algebra and therefore stable. It is
therefore conceptually easier and more straightforward to work with a Clifford
algebra. The Clifford algebra path suggests the next evolutionary step toward a
theory of physics at the interface of GR and QM might be to depart from working

multi-component wave function) to a walker at site and by introducing a quantum
coin, which is a matrix representation of a unitary transformation. In quantum
walks, the qudit of walker is mixed according to the quantum coin at each time
step, when the walker hops to other sites. As special cases of the quantum
walks driven by high-dimensional quantum coins generally studied by Brun,
Carteret, and Ambainis, we study the models obtained by choosing rotation as
the unitary transformation, whose matrix representations determine quantum
coins. We show that Wigner's $(2j+1)$-dimensional unitary representations of
rotations with half-integers $j$'s are useful to analyze the probability laws
of quantum walks. For any value of half-integer $j$, convergence of all moments
of walker's pseudovelocity in the long-time limit is proved. It is generally
shown for the present models that, if $(2j+1)$ is even, the probability measure
of limit distribution is given by a superposition of $(2j+1)/2$ terms of scaled
Konno's density functions, and if $(2j+1)$ is odd, it is a superposition of $j$
terms of scaled Konno's density functions and a Dirac's delta function at the
origin. For the two-, three-, and four-component models, the probability
densities of limit distributions are explicitly calculated and their dependence
on the parameters of quantum coins and on the initial qudit of walker is
completely determined. Comparison with computer simulation results is also
shown.

the context of light-quanta and wave-particle duality. On the basis of the
original publications (from Planck's derivation of the black-body spectrum and
Einstein's introduction of the photons up to the results of Born, Heisenberg

on the first line of thoughts that led to the concept of quanta. The nature of
the particle-like fluctuations and the wave-like fluctuations are analysed by
using several approaches. With the help of the classical probability theory, it
is shown that the infinite divisibility of the Bose distribution leads to the
new concept of classical poissonian photo-multiplets or to the binary
photo-multiplets of fermionic character. As an application, Einstein's

statistical operator by a Wick rotation. This strict relation between
statistical mechanics and quantum evolution can reveal deep results when the
thermodynamic limit is considered. These results translate in a set of theorems
proving that these effects can be effectively at work producing an emerging
classical world without recurring to any external entity that in some cases
cannot be properly defined. In a many-body system has been recently shown that
Gaussian decay of the coherence is the rule with a duration of recurrence more
and more small as the number of particles increases. This effect has been
observed experimentally. More generally, a theorem about coherence of bulk
matter can be proved. All this takes us to the conclusion that a well definite
boundary for the quantum to classical world does exist and that can be drawn by
the thermodynamic limit, extending in this way the deep link between
statistical mechanics and quantum evolution to a high degree.

  impurities</title><description>  We consider a one-dimensional (1D) wire along which single conduction
electrons can propagate in the presence of two spin-1/2 magnetic impurities.
The electron may be scattered by each impurity via a contact-exchange
interaction and thus a spin-flip generally occurs at each scattering event.
Adopting a quantum waveguide theory approach, we derive the stationary states
of the system at all orders in the electron-impurity exchange coupling
constant. This allows us to investigate electron transmission for arbitrary
initial states of the two impurity spins. We show that for suitable electron
wave vectors, the triplet and singlet maximally entangled spin states of the
impurities can respectively largely inhibit the electron transport or make the
wire completely transparent for any electron spin state. In the latter case, a
resonance condition can always be found, representing an anomalous behaviour
compared to typical decoherence induced by magnetic impurities. We provide an
explanation for these phenomena in terms of the Hamiltonian symmetries.
Finally, a scheme to generate maximally entangled spin states of the two
impurities via electron scattering is proposed.

single-site entanglement and the determination of quantum critical points. The
formalism allows to identify the existence and location of factorization
points, and a purely quantum {\it ``transition of entanglement''} that occurs
at the approach of factorization. This kind of quantum transition is
characterized by a diverging ratio of excitation energies associated to

displays various QPTs, with two (qubit) as well as more (qudit) on-site degrees

measures of bipartite/multipartite quantum correlations. It is found that all
transitions ascribed to two-point correlations are characterized by an
entanglement range which diverges at the transition points. The exponent
coincides with that of the correlation length at the transitions. We introduce
the correlation ratio, namely, the ratio of quantum mutual information and
single-site entanglement. We show that at T=0, it captures the relative role of
two-point and multipartite quantum correlations at transition points,
generalizing to qudit systems the entanglement ratio. Moreover, a finite value

Butterfly. In this network, there are two flow paths, s_1 to t_1 and s_2 to
t_2, which share a single bottleneck channel of capacity one. So, if we
consider conventional flow (of liquid, for instance), then the total amount of
flow must be at most one in total, say 1/2 for each path. However, if we
consider information flow, then we can send two bits (one for each path) at the
same time by exploiting two side links, which are of no use for the liquid-type
flow, and encoding/decoding operations at each node. This is known as network
coding and has been quite popular since its introduction by Ahlswede, Cai, Li
and Yeung in 2000. In QIP 2006, Hayashi et al showed that quantum network
coding is possible for Butterfly, namely we can send two qubits simultaneously
with keeping their fidelity strictly greater than 1/2.
  In this paper, we show that the result can be extended to a large class of
general graphs by using a completely different approach. The underlying
technique is a new cloning method called entanglement-free cloning which does
not produce any entanglement at all. This seems interesting on its own and to
show its possibility is an even more important purpose of this paper. Combining
this new cloning with approximation of general quantum states by a small number
of fixed ones, we can design a quantum network coding protocol which
``simulates'' its classical counterpart for the same graph.

the fast detector are used to generate secure key. We apply this idea to
various QKD protocols. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements

This undermines the possibility of objectivity in physics. However, quantum

It is done with the purpose to obtain precise definitions of effective distinct
particles, and of the limitations involved. Namely, certain restrictions allow
one to distinguish identical particles in the general case of N of them, and of
J clusters of effectively distinct particles, where N and J are arbitrary
integers (but 1&lt;J&lt;(N+1)). Mutually orthogonal, single-particle distinguishing

proving lower bounds on quantum query complexity. It gives optimal lower bounds
for many problems, has application to classical complexity in formula size
lower bounds, and is versatile with equivalent formulations in terms of weight
schemes, eigenvalues, and Kolmogorov complexity. All these formulations rely on
the principle that if an algorithm successfully computes a function then, in
particular, it is able to distinguish between inputs which map to different
values.
  We present a stronger version of the adversary method which goes beyond this
principle to make explicit use of the stronger condition that the algorithm
actually computes the function. This new method, which we call ADV+-, has all
the advantages of the old: it is a lower bound on bounded-error quantum query
complexity, its square is a lower bound on formula size, and it behaves well
with respect to function composition. Moreover ADV+- is always at least as
large as the adversary method ADV, and we show an example of a monotone
function for which ADV+-(f)=Omega(ADV(f)^1.098). We also give examples showing
that ADV+- does not face limitations of ADV like the certificate complexity
barrier and the property testing barrier.

Electromagnetic and other (spin or boson) fluctuations due to the background

against certain kinds of parametric noise, the very motivation of this
robustness being the geometric character of the transformation achieved in the
adiabatic limit. On the other hand, the effects of decoherence are expected to
become more and more relevant when the adiabatic limit is approached. Starting
from the system described by Florio et al. [Phys. Rev. A 73, 022327 (2006)],
here we discuss the behavior of non ideal holonomic gates at finite operational
time, i.e., far before the adiabatic limit is reached. We have considered
several models of parametric noise and studied the robustness of finite time
gates. The obtained results suggest that the finite time gates present some
effects of cancellation of the perturbations introduced by the noise which
mimic the geometrical cancellation effect of standard holonomic gates.

observed in multipartite quantum systems results from the consideration of
states created during the execution of the standard end-to-end quantum
teleportation protocol (and a few additional local operations and classical
communication (LOCC) steps) on a linear chain of singlets. Some of these
intermediate states are tensor products of bound-entangled (BE) states, and
hence, by construction possess distillable entanglement, which can be unlocked
by simply completing the rest of the LOCC operations required by the underlying
teleportation protocol. We use this systematic approach to construct both new
and known examples of superactivation of bound entanglement, and first examples
of activation of BE states using other BE states. A surprising outcome is the
construction of noiseless quantum relay channels with no distillable
entanglement between any two parties, except for that between the two end
nodes.

measurements is a crucial task in building quantum information processing
hardware. The predominant state estimation procedure, maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE), generally reports an estimate with zero eigenvalues. These
cannot be justified. Furthermore, the MLE estimate is incompatible with error
bars, so conclusions drawn from it are suspect. I propose an alternative
procedure, Bayesian mean estimation (BME). BME never yields zero eigenvalues,
its eigenvalues provide a bound on their own uncertainties, and it is the most

to obtain natural error bars that are compatible with the estimate. Finally, I
briefly discuss the differences between Bayesian and frequentist estimation

  Viewpoints</title><description>  Mixed states are introduced in physics in order to express our ignorance
about the actual state of a physical system and are represented in standard
quantum mechanics (QM) by density operators. Such operators also appear if one
considers a (pure) entangled state of a compound system $\Omega$ and performs
partial traces on the projection operator representing it. Yet, they do not
represent mixed states (or proper mixtures) of the subsystems in this case, but
improper mixtures, since the coefficients in the convex sums expressing them
never bear the ignorance interpretation. Hence, one cannot attribute states to
the subsystems of a compound physical system in QM (subentity problem). We
discuss here two alternative proposals that can be worked out within the
Brussels and Lecce approaches. We firstly summarize the general framework
provided by the former, which suggests that improper mixtures could be
considered as new pure states. Then, we show that improper mixtures can be
considered as true (yet nonpure) states also according to the latter. The two
proposals seem to be compatible notwithstanding their different terminologies.

Based on two conditions for the optimum measurement operators, and on a

the accuracy of theory-experiment comparisons is determined by the level of

an imperfect knowledge of the optical properties of real mirrors used in the
experiment, the effect of imperfect reflection remains a source of uncertainty
in theory-experiment comparisons. For the same reason, the temperature
dependence of the Casimir force between dissipative mirrors remains a matter of
debate. We also emphasize that real mirrors do not obey exactly the assumption
of specular reflection, which is used in nearly all calculations of material

general scattering formalism accounting for non-specular reflection with
wavevectors and field polarizations mixed. This general formalism has already

non-unitary collapse due to negative-result measurement. In the case of a
relatively weak driving, the qubit dynamics is dominated by the non-unitary
evolution, and the qubit state tends to an asymptotically stable point on the
Bloch sphere. This dynamics can be clearly distinguished from conventional
decoherence by tracking the state purity and the measurement invariant
(``murity''). When the microwave driving strength exceeds certain critical
value, the dynamics changes to non-decaying oscillations: any initial state
returns exactly to itself periodically in spite of non-unitary dynamics. The
predictions can be verified using a modification of a recent experiment.

  Coupled to a Structured Reservoir</title><description>  The decay dynamics of the classical electromagnetic field in a leaky optical
resonator supporting a single mode coupled to a structured continuum of modes
(reservoir) is theoretically investigated, and the issue of threshold condition
for lasing in presence of an inverted medium is comprehensively addressed.
Specific analytical results are given for a single-mode microcavity resonantly
coupled to a coupled resonator optical waveguide (CROW), which supports a band
of continuous modes acting as decay channels. For weak coupling, the usual
exponential Weisskopf-Wigner (Markovian) decay of the field in the bare
resonator is found, and the threshold for lasing increases linearly with the
coupling strength. As the coupling between the microcavity and the structured
reservoir increases, the field decay in the passive cavity shows non
exponential features, and correspondingly the threshold for lasing ceases to
increase, reaching a maximum and then starting to decrease as the coupling
strength is further increased. A singular behavior for the &quot;laser phase
transition&quot;, which is a clear signature of strong non-Markovian dynamics, is
found at critical values of the coupling between the microcavity and the
reservoir.

features of quantum computing, as it leads to massive quantum parallelism,
hence to exponential computational speed-up. In a sense, quantum entanglement
is considered as an implicit property of quantum computation itself. But...can
it be made explicit? In other words, is it possible to find the connective
&quot;entanglement&quot; in a logical sequent calculus for the machine language? And
also, is it possible to &quot;teach&quot; the quantum computer to &quot;mimic&quot; the EPR
&quot;paradox&quot;? The answer is in the affirmative, if the logical sequent calculus is
that of the weakest possible logic, namely Basic logic. A weak logic has few
structural rules. But in logic, a weak structure leaves more room for
connectives (for example the connective &quot;entanglement&quot;). Furthermore, the
absence in Basic logic of the two structural rules of contraction and weakening
corresponds to the validity of the no-cloning and no-erase theorems,
respectively, in quantum computing.

  uniformly accelerated detectors</title><description>  Using nonperturbative results obtained recently for an uniformly accelerated
Unruh-DeWitt detector, we discover new features in the dynamical evolution of
the detector's internal degree of freedom, and identified the Unruh effect
derived originally from time-dependent perturbation theory as operative in the
ultra-weak coupling and ultra-high acceleration limits. The mutual interaction
between the detector and the field engenders entanglement between them, and
tracing out the field leads to a mixed state of the detector even for a
detector at rest in Minkowski vacuum. Our findings based on this exact solution
shows clearly the differences from the ordinary result where the quantum
field's backreaction is ignored in that the detector no longer behaves like a
perfect thermometer. From a calculation of the evolution of the reduced density
matrix of the detector, we find that the transition probability from the
initial ground state over an infinitely long duration of interaction derived
from time-dependent perturbation theory is existent in the exact solution only
in transient under special limiting conditions corresponding to the Markovian
regime. Furthermore, the detector at late times never sees an exact Boltzmann
distribution over the energy eigenstates of the free detector, thus in the
non-Markovian regime covering a wider range of parameters the Unruh temperature
cannot be identified inside the detector.

  superpositions</title><description>  Recent experiments claiming formation of quantum superposition states in near
macroscopic sys- tems raise the question of how the sizes of general quantum
superposition states in an interacting system are to be quantified. We propose
here a measure of size for such superposition states that is based on what
measurements can be performed to probe and distinguish the different branches
of the state. The measure allows comparison of the effective size for
superposition states in very different physical systems. It can be applied to a
very general class of superposition states and reproduces known results for
near-ideal cases. Comparison with a prior measure based on analy- sis of
coherence between branches indicates that significantly smaller effective
superposition sizes result from our measurement-based measure. Application to a
system of interacting bosons in a double-well trapping potential shows that the
effective superposition size is strongly dependent on the relative magnitude of
the barrier height and interparticle interaction.

boundary conditions (b.c.) on infinite parallel plates is revisited in the
local quantum field theory (lqft) framework introduced by B.Kay. The model
displays a number of more realistic features than the ones he treated. In
addition to local observables, as the energy density, we propose to consider
intensive variables, such as the energy per unit area $\epsilon$, as
fundamental observables. Adopting this view, lqft rejects Dirichlet (the same
result may be proved for Neumann or mixed) b.c., and accepts periodic b.c.: in
the former case $\epsilon$ diverges, in the latter it is finite, as is shown by
an expression for the local energy density obtained from lqft through the use
of the Poisson summation formula. Another way to see this uses methods from the
Euler summation formula: in the proof of regularization independence of the
energy per unit area, a regularization-dependent surface term arises upon use
of Dirichlet b.c. but not periodic b.c.. For the conformally invariant scalar
quantum field, this surface term is absent, due to the condition of zero trace
of the energy momentum tensor, as remarked by B.De Witt. The latter property
does not hold in tha application to the dark energy problem in Cosmology, in
which we argue that periodic b.c. might play a distinguished role.

  Information Theory</title><description>  In this thesis we study the problem of unambiguously discriminating two mixed
quantum states. We first present reduction theorems for optimal unambiguous
discrimination of two generic density matrices. We show that this problem can
be reduced to that of two density matrices that have the same rank $r$ in a
2$r$-dimensional Hilbert space. These reduction theorems also allow us to
reduce USD problems to simpler ones for which the solution might be known. As
an application, we consider the unambiguous comparison of $n$ linearly
independent pure states with a simple symmetry. Moreover, lower bounds on the
optimal failure probability have been derived. For two mixed states they are
given in terms of the fidelity. Here we give tighter bounds as well as
necessary and sufficient conditions for two mixed states to reach these bounds.
We also construct the corresponding optimal measurement. With this result, we
provide analytical solutions for unambiguously discriminating a class of
generic mixed states. This goes beyond known results which are all reducible to
some pure state case. We however show that examples exist where the bounds
cannot be reached. Next, we derive properties on the rank and the spectrum of
an optimal USD measurement. This finally leads to a second class of exact
solutions. Indeed we present the optimal failure probability as well as the
optimal measurement for unambiguously discriminating any pair of geometrically
uniform mixed states in four dimensions. This class of problems includes for
example the discrimination of both the basis and the bit value mixed states in
the BB84 QKD protocol with coherent states.

the Riemann generator of the prime number counting function, p(x), that in turn

plays the role of the spring strength of the quantum limiting harmonic
oscillator. The number theory meaning of this result is that the roots height
up of the zeta function are the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian whose potential is
the number of primes squared up to a given x. Therefore this may prove the
never published Hilbert-Polya conjecture. The conjecture is true but does not
imply the truth of the Riemann hypothesis. We can have complex conjugated zeros
off the Riemman line and map them with another hermitic operator and a general
expression is given for that. The zeros off the line affect the fluctuation of

is a simple particular case where several parameters in the Hamiltonian are
zero and one of the remaining nonzero parameters has no effect on the time

also are generally determined to within a change of signs by the time

  Capacity</title><description>  We give a new geometric interpretation of quantum pure states. Using
  Voronoi diagrams, we reinterpret the structure of the space of pure states as
a subspace of the quantum state space. In addition to the known coincidence of
some Voronoi diagrams for one-qubit pure states, we will show that even for
mixed one-qubit states, as far as sites are given as pure states, the Voronoi
diagram with respect to some distances -- the divergence, the Bures distance,
and the Euclidean distance -- are all the same.
  As to higher level pure quantum states, for the divergence, the
  Fubini-Study distance, and the Bures distance, the coincidence of the
diagrams still holds, while the coincidence of the diagrams with respect to the
divergence and the Euclidean distance no longer holds. That fact has a
significant meaning when we try to apply the method used for a numerical
estimation of a one-qubit quantum channel capacity to a higher level system.

  rational numbers as states of qubit strings</title><description>  In this paper fields of quantum reference frames based on gauge
transformations of rational string states are described in a way that,
hopefully, makes them more understandable than their description in an earlier
paper. The approach taken here is based on three main points: (1) There are a
large number of different quantum theory representations of natural numbers,
integers, and rational numbers as states of qubit strings. (2) For each
representation, Cauchy sequences of rational string states give a
representation of the real (and complex) numbers. A reference frame is
associated to each representation. (3) Each frame contains a representation of
all mathematical and physical theories that have the representations of the
real and complex numbers as a scalar base for the theories. These points and
other aspects of the resulting fields are then discussed and justified in some
detail. Also two different methods of relating the frame field to physics are
discussed.

(QKD) protocols in the presence of loss introduced by the quantum channel. Our
analysis is based on a simple precondition for secure QKD in each case. In
particular, the legitimate users need to prove that there exists no separable
state (in the case of two-way QKD), or that there exists no quantum state
having a symmetric extension (one-way QKD), that is compatible with the
available measurements results. We show that both criteria can be formulated as
a convex optimisation problem known as a semidefinite program, which can be
efficiently solved. Moreover, we prove that the solution to the dual
optimisation corresponds to the evaluation of an optimal witness operator that
belongs to the minimal verification set of them for the given two-way (or
one-way) QKD protocol. A positive expectation value of this optimal witness
operator states that no secret key can be distilled from the available

potential barrier is investigated from the viewpoint of interference between
multiple finite wave packets, due to the multiple reflections inside the well
or barrier. In the case of potential-well traveling that is classically
allowed, each of the successively transmitted constituents is delayed by a
subluminal time. When the thickness of the well is much smaller in comparision
with a characteristic length of the incident wave packet, the reshaped wave
packet in transmission maintains the profile of the incident wave packet. In
the case of potential-barrier tunneling that is classically forbidden, though
each of the successively transmitted constituents is delayed by a time that is
independent of the barrier thickness, the interference between multiple
transmitted constituents explains the barrier-thickness dependence of the
traversal time for thin barriers and its barrier-thickness independence for
thick barriers. This manifests the nature of Hartman effect.

which is important for a precise prediction of the Casimir force. Significant
variation of the data demonstrates genuine sample dependence of the dielectric
function. We demonstrate that the Casimir force is largely determined by the
material properties in the low frequency domain and argue that therefore the
precise values of the Drude parameters are crucial for an accurate evaluation
of the force. These parameters can be estimated by two different methods,
either by fitting real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function at low
frequencies, or via a Kramers-Kronig analysis based on the imaginary part of
the dielectric function in the extended frequency range. Both methods lead to
very similar results. We show that the variation of the Casimir force
calculated with the use of different optical data can be as large as 5% and at
any rate cannot be ignored. To have a reliable prediction of the force with a
precision of 1%, one has to measure the optical properties of metallic films
used for the force measurement.

Fourier transform (QFT) over $Z_q$, which is considered the most ``quantum''
part of Shor's algorithm, can in fact be simulated efficiently by classical
computers.
  More precisely, we observe that the QFT can be performed by a circuit of
poly-logarithmic path-width, if the circuit is allowed to apply not only
unitary gates but also general linear gates. Recalling the results of Markov
and Shi [MaSh] and Jozsa [Jo] which provided classical simulations of such
circuits in time exponential in the tree-width, this implies the result stated
in the title.
  Classical simulations of the FFT are of course meaningless when applied to
classical input strings on which their result is already known; Our observation
might be interesting only in the context in which the QFT is used as a
subroutine and applied to more interesting superpositions. We discuss the
reasons why this idea seems to fail to provide an efficient classical
simulation of the entire factoring algorithm.
  In the course of proving our observation, we provide two alternative proofs
of the results of [MaSh,Jo] which we use. One proof is very similar in spirit
to that of [MaSh] but is more visual, and is based on a graph parameter which
we call the ``bubble width'', tightly related to the path- and tree-width. The
other proof is based on connections to the Jones polynomial; It is very short,
if one is willing to rely on several known results.

  computation</title><description>  In a quantum computation with pure states, the generation of large amounts of
entanglement is known to be necessary for a speedup with respect to classical
computations. However, examples of quantum computations with mixed states are
known, such as the deterministic computation with one quantum qubit (DQC1)
model [Knill and Laflamme, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5672 (1998)], in which
entanglement is at most marginally present, and yet a computational speedup is
believed to occur. Correlations, and not entanglement, have been identified as
a necessary ingredient for mixed-state quantum computation speedups. Here we
show that correlations, as measured through the operator Schmidt rank, are
indeed present in large amounts in the DQC1 circuit. This provides evidence for
the preclusion of efficient classical simulation of DQC1 by means of a whole
class of classical simulation algorithms, thereby reinforcing the conjecture
that DQC1 leads to a genuine quantum computational speedup.

robustness to loss, their security can be affected by more general attacks

  in D+1 dimensional QFT</title><description>  We consider quantum field theories with boundary on a codimension one
hyperplane. Using 1+1 dimensional examples, we clarify the relation between
three parameters characterising one-point functions, finite size corrections to
the ground state energy and the singularity structure of scattering amplitudes,
respectively. We then develop the formalism of boundary states in general D+1
spacetime dimensions and relate the cluster expansion of the boundary state to
the correlation functions using reduction formulae. This allows us to derive
the cluster expansion in terms of the boundary scattering amplitudes, and to
give a derivation of the conjectured relations between the parameters in 1+1
dimensions, and their generalization to D+1 dimensions. We use these results to
express the large volume asymptotics of the Casimir effect in terms of the
one-point functions or alternatively the singularity structure of the
one-particle reflection factor, and for the case of vanishing one-particle
couplings we give a complete proof of our previous result for the leading
behaviour.

  interactions</title><description>  Heat and work for quantum systems governed by dissipative master equations
with a time-dependent driving field were introduced in the pioneering work of
Alicki [J. Phys. A 12, L103 (1979)]. Alicki's work was in the Schroedinger
picture; here we extend these definitions to the Heisenberg and interaction
pictures. We show that in order to avoid consistency problems, the full time
derivatives in the definitions for heat flux and power (work flux) should be
replaced by partial time derivatives. We also present an alternative approach
to the partitioning of the energy flux which differs from that of Alicki in
that the instantaneous interaction energy with the external field is not
included directly. We then proceed to generalize Alicki's definition of power
by replacing the original system and its external driving field with a larger,
bipartite system, governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian. Using the
definition of heat flux and the generalized definition of power, we derive the
first law of thermodynamics in differential form, both for the full bipartite
system and the partially traced subsystems. Although the second law (Clausius
formulation) is satisfied for the full bipartite system, we find that in
general there is no rigorous formulation of the second law for the partially
traced subsystem unless certain additional requirements are met. Once these
requirements are satisfied, however, both the Carnot and the Clausius
formulations of the second law are satisfied. We illustrate this thermodynamic
analysis on both the simple Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM) and an extended
dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model (ED-JCM), which is a model for a quantum
amplifier.

Scovil and Schulz-DuBois [Phys. Rev. Lett. 2, 262 (1959)]. In this work we
consider the same three-level model, but treat both the matter and light
quantum mechanically. Specifically, we analyze an extended (three-level)
dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model (ED-JCM) within the framework of a quantum
heat engine, using novel formulas for heat flux and power in bipartite systems
introduced in our previous work [E. Boukobza and D. J. Tannor, PRA (in press)].
Amplification of the selected cavity mode occurs even in this simple model, as
seen by a positive steady state power. However, initial field coherence is
lost, as seen by the decaying off-diagonal field density matrix elements, and
by the Husimi-Kano Q function. We show that after an initial transient time the
field's entropy rises linearly during the operation of the engine, which we
attribute to the dissipative nature of the evolution and not to matter-field
entanglement. We show that the second law of thermodynamics is satisfied in two
formulations (Clausius, Carnot) and that the efficiency of the ED-JCM heat
engine agrees with that defined intuitively by Scovil and Schulz-DuBois.
Finally, we compare the steady state heat flux and power of the fully quantum
model with the semiclassical counterpart of the ED-JCM, and derive the engine
efficiency formula of Scovil and Schulz-DuBois analytically from fundamental
thermodynamic fluxes.

based on high accuracy numerical solutions to the static and time dependent
Schroedinger equation for the full Squid Hamiltonian in one and two variables.
Among the points examined in the static analysis is the range of validity of
the effective two-state or ``spin 1/2'' picture. A range of parameters is
determined where the picture holds to good accuracy as the energy levels
undergo gate manipulations. Some general points are presented concerning the
relations between device parameters and ``good'' quantum mechanical state

  The time dependent simulations allow the examination of suitable conditions
for adiabatic behavior, and permits the introduction of a random noise to
simulate the effects of decoherence. A formula is derived and tested relating
the random noise to the decoherence rate. Sensitivity to device and operating
parameters for the logical gates NOT and CNOT are examined, with particular
attention to values of the tunnel parameter beta slightly above one. It appears
that with values of beta close to one, a quantum CNOT gate is possible even
with rather short decoherence times.
  Many of the methods and results will apply to coupled double-potential well

entanglement more than other types. A typical case is called state ordering
change, in which two input states with different amounts of entanglement
undergoes a local decoherence and the state with the larger entanglement
results in an output state with less entanglement than the other output state.
We are also interested in a special case where the state with the larger
entanglement evolves to a separable state while the other output state is still
entangled, which we call selective entanglement breaking. For three-level or
larger systems, it is easy to find examples of the state ordering change and
the selective entanglement breaking, but for two-level systems it is not
trivial whether such situations exist. We present a new strategy to construct
examples of two-qubit states exhibiting the selective entanglement breaking
regardless of entanglement measure. We also give a more striking example of the
selective entanglement breaking in which the less entangled input state has

one? Moreover, deployment of the concepts of information and computation in
novel contexts hints at new (or better) means of understanding quantum
mechanics, and perhaps even invites re-assessment of traditional material
conceptions of the basic nature of the physical world. In this paper I review
some of these philosophical aspects of quantum information theory, begining
with an elementary survey of the theory, seeking to highlight some of the
principles and heuristics involved. We move on to a discussion of the nature
and definition of quantum information and deploy the findings in discussing the

respectively, what one might learn from the development of quantum computation
(both about the nature of quantum systems and about the nature of computation)
and consider the impact of quantum information theory on the traditional
foundational questions of quantum mechanics (treating of the views of

The large correlation between the results of the two measurements demonstrates
the QND nature of the readout method. The fact that a QND measurement is

on the polarization direction attainable by an unentangled measurement, i.e.,
by a measurement, whose outcomes are associated with product states. We develop
analytically the upper bound 0.7935 bits to the Shannon mutual information

controllability of finite-dimensional open quantum systems whose dynamics are
represented by Kraus maps. For any pair of states (pure or mixed) on the
Hilbert space of the system, we explicitly show how to construct a Kraus map
that transforms one state into another. Moreover, we prove by construction the
existence of a Kraus map that transforms all initial states into a predefined
target state (such a process may be used, for example, in quantum information
dilution). Thus, in sharp contrast to unitary control, Kraus-map dynamics
allows for the design of controls which are robust to variations in the initial
state of the system. The general formalism is illustrated with examples of
state-to-state Kraus transformations in a two-level system. In particular, we
construct a family of non-unitary Kraus maps, which transform one pure state
into another. The problem of dynamic state controllability of open quantum
systems (i.e., controllability of state-to-state transformations, given a set
of available dynamical resources such as coherent controls, incoherent
interactions with the environment, and measurements) is also discussed.

operator that is a $c$-number function and a power series of perturbation
including all order approximations in the unperturbed Hamiltonian
representation. Based on it, we obtain an exact solution of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger
equation in general quantum systems independent of time. Comparison of our
exact solution with the existed perturbation theory makes some features and
significance of our exact solution clear. The conclusions expressly indicate
that our exact solution is obviously consistent with the usual time-independent
perturbation theory at any order approximation, it explicitly calculates out
the expanding coefficients of the unperturbed state in the non-perturbation
method, and it fully solves the recurrence equation of the expansion
coefficients of final state in the unperturbed Hamiltonian representation from
a view of time-dependent perturbation theory. At the same time, the exact

late as possible. Our main skills are Hamiltonian redivision so as to overcome
a flaw of the usual perturbation theory, and the perturbing Hamiltonian matrix
product decomposition in order to separate the contraction and anti-contraction
terms. Our calculational technology is the limit process for eliminating
apparent divergences. Our central idea is ``dynamical rearrangement and

all order approximations absorbed in our perturbed solution. Consequently, we
obtain the improved forms of the zeroth, first, second and third order

correlated noise observed for e.g. photons or bosonic neutral atoms can still
be explained within a classical field description with fluctuating phases, the
anticorrelations in the detection of fermionic particles have no classical
analogue. The observation of such fermionic antibunching is so far scarce and
has been confined to electrons and neutrons. Here we report on the first direct
observation of antibunching of neutral fermionic atoms. Through an analysis of
the atomic shot noise in a set of standard absorption images, of a gas of
fermionic 40K atoms released from an optical lattice, we find reduced
correlations for distances related to the original spacing of the trapped
atoms. The detection of such quantum statistical correlations has allowed us to
characterise the ordering and temperature of the Fermi gas in the lattice.
Moreover, our findings are an important step towards revealing fundamental

fundamental interest in understanding properties and uses of entanglement. Two
stabilizer states are equivalent under the usual stochastic local operations
and classical communication criterion if and only if they are equivalent under
local unitary (LU) operations. More surprisingly, under certain conditions, two
LU equivalent stabilizer states are also equivalent under local Clifford (LC)
operations, as was shown by Van den Nest et al. [Phys. Rev. \textbf{A71},
062323]. Here, we broaden the class of stabilizer states for which LU
equivalence implies LC equivalence ($LU\Leftrightarrow LC$) to include all
stabilizer states represented by graphs with neither cycles of length 3 nor 4.
To compare our result with Van den Nest et al.'s, we show that any stabilizer
state of distance $\delta=2$ is beyond their criterion. We then further prove
that $LU\Leftrightarrow LC$ holds for a more general class of stabilizer states
of $\delta=2$. We also explicitly construct graphs representing $\delta&gt;2$
stabilizer states which are beyond their criterion: we identify all 58 graphs
with up to 11 vertices and construct graphs with $2^m-1$ ($m\geq 4$) vertices

Our numerical results show the dependence of the entanglement evolution upon

dense as |t| increases. Secondly, we show that if U is a sparse unitary
operator with a gap \Delta in its spectrum, then there exists an approximate
logarithm H of U which is also sparse. The sparsity pattern of H gets more
dense as 1/\Delta increases. These two results can be interpreted as a way to
convert between local continuous-time and local discrete-time processes. As an
example we show that the discrete-time coined quantum walk can be realised as
an approximately local continuous-time quantum walk. Finally, we use our
construction to provide a definition for a fractional quantum fourier
transform.

We present the spectral theory of the light-atoms interaction and show how
particular spectral modes of quantum light couple to spatial modes of the
extended atomic ensemble. We show how this interaction can be used for quantum
memory storage and retrieval and for deterministic entanglement protocols. The
proposed protocols are attractive due to their simplicity since they involve
just a single pass of light through atoms without the need for elaborate pulse

two languages $\mathcal{L}^{\ast}(x)$ and $\mathcal{L}(x)$ with classical
set-theoretical semantics which allow us to illustrate those meanings and to
show that the non-Boolean lattice of propositions of quantum logic (QL) can be
obtained by selecting a subset of \textit{p-testable} propositions within the

standard interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) because of known no-go
theorems. But if one accepts our criticism of these theorems and the ensuing SR
(semantic realism) interpretation of QM, the incompatibility disappears, and
the classical and quantum notions of truth can coexist, since they refer to
different metalinguistic concepts (\textit{truth} and \textit{verifiability
according to QM}, respectively). Moreover one can construct a quantum language
$\mathcal{L}_{TQ}(x)$ whose Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra is isomorphic to QL, the
sentences of which state (testable) properties of individual samples of
physical systems, while standard QL does not bear this interpretation.

degrees of belief rather than objective properties of systems, the question of
what other elements of the quantum formalism must also be taken as subjective
is addressed. In particular, we ask this of the dynamical aspects of the
formalism, such as Hamiltonians and unitary operators. Whilst some operations,
such as the update maps corresponding to a complete projective measurement,
must be subjective, the situation is not so clear in other cases. Here, it is
argued that all trace preserving completely positive maps, including unitary
operators, should be regarded as subjective, in the same sense as a classical
conditional probability distribution. The argument is based on a reworking of
the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism in terms of &quot;conditional&quot; density operators
and trace preserving completely positive maps, which mimics the relationship
between conditional probabilities and stochastic maps in classical probability.

This model of quantum baths can be of fundamental importance for the

here we show how to implement a pure dephasing model for a qubit system coupled

showing what happens when the bath enters different phases, or becomes

arbitrary input $\rho_j$, the distance $D_j (\Lambda_j [ \rho_j ], \rho_j)$
between the input $\rho_j$ and the output $\Lambda_j [ \rho_j ]$ of the channel
is less than $\epsilon$. Given this assumption we show that for an arbitrary

$\rho_{12}$ and the output $\Lambda_1\otimes\Lambda_2[\rho_{12} ]$ fulfills the
bound $D_{12} (\Lambda_1 \otimes \Lambda_2 [ \rho_{12} ], \rho_{12}) \leq
\sqrt{2+ 2 \sqrt{(1-1/d_1)(1-1/d_2)}} \epsilon$ where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are
dimensions of first and second quantum system respectively. On the contrary,
entangled states are transformed in such a way, that the bound on the action of
the local channels is $D_{12} (\Lambda_1 \otimes \Lambda_2 [ \rho_{12} ],
\rho_{12}) \leq 2 \sqrt{2 - 1/d} \: \epsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of
the smaller of the two quantum systems passing through the channels. Our
results show that the fundamental distinction between the set of separable and
the set of entangled states results into two different bounds which in turn can
be exploited for a discrimination between the two sets of states. We generalize
our results to multi-partite channels.

- the idea that God is playing at dice. Later he changed his ground, and
focussed instead on the point that the Copenhagen Interpretation leads to what
Einstein saw as the abandonment of physical realism. We argue here that
Einstein's initial intuition was perfectly sound, and that it is precisely the
fact that quantum mechanics is a fundamentally probabilistic theory which is at
the root of all the controversies regarding its interpretation. Probability is
an intrinsically logical concept. This means that the quantum state has an
essentially logical significance. It is extremely difficult to reconcile that
fact with Einstein's belief, that it is the task of physics to give us a vision
of the world apprehended sub specie aeternitatis. Quantum mechanics thus
presents us with a simple choice: either to follow Einstein in looking for a
theory which is not probabilistic at the fundamental level, or else to accept
that physics does not in fact put us in the position of God looking down on
things from above. There is a widespread fear that the latter alternative must
inevitably lead to a greatly impoverished, positivistic view of physical
theory. It appears to us, however, that the truth is just the opposite. The

that the environment, by means of a dissipative interaction, furnishes a

(1869) to atomic physics (in the 1900's), nuclear physics (in the 1932's) and
particle physics (from 1953 to 2006). We show how the consideration of
symmetries, largely used in physics since the end of the 1920's, gave rise to a
new format of the periodic table in the 1970's. More specifically, this paper
is concerned with the application of the group SO(4,2)xSU(2) to the periodic
table of chemical elements. It is shown how the Madelung rule of the atomic
shell model can be used for setting up a periodic table that can be further
rationalized via the group SO(4,2)xSU(2) and some of its subgroups. Qualitative
results are obtained from this nonstandard table.

to completely eliminate decoherence and also provide conditions under which it
can be done so. A novel construction employing an auxiliary system, the bait,
which is instrumental to decoupling the system from the environment is
presented. Our approach to decoherence control in contrast to other approaches
in the literature involves the bilinear input affine model of quantum control
system which lends itself to various techniques from classical control theory,
but with non-trivial modifications to the quantum regime. The elegance of this
approach yields interesting results on open loop decouplability and Decoherence
Free Subspaces(DFS). Additionally, the feedback control of decoherence may be
related to disturbance decoupling for classical input affine systems, which
entails careful application of the methods by avoiding all the quantum
mechanical pitfalls. In the process of calculating a suitable feedback the
system has to be restructured due to its tensorial nature of interaction with
the environment, which is unique to quantum systems. The results are
qualitatively different and superior to the ones obtained via master equations.
Finally, a methodology to synthesize feedback parameters itself is given, that
technology permitting, could be implemented for practical 2-qubit systems to
perform decoherence free Quantum Computing.

the perspective of the conformal field theory for the two-dimensional critical
Ising model. This scheme originally used the monodromy properties of the
non-Abelian excitations in the Pfaffian quantum Hall state to construct
elementary qubits and execute logical NOT on them. We extend the scheme of Das
Sarma et al. by exploiting the explicit braiding transformations for the
Pfaffian wave functions containing 4 and 6 quasiholes to implement, for the
first time in this context, the single-qubit Hadamard and phase gates and the
two-qubit Controlled-NOT gate over Pfaffian qubits in a topologically protected

braid groups B_4, B_6 and B_8 and use the elementary braid matrices to
implement one-, two- and three-qubit gates. We also propose to construct a
topologically protected Toffoli gate, in terms of a braid-group based
Controlled-Controlled-Z gate precursor. Finally we discuss some difficulties
arising in the embedding of the Clifford gates and address several important
questions about topological quantum computation in general.

approaches the ordinary Heisenberg algebra in a suitable limit. We thus obtain
a certain insight into how quantum mechanics may be regarded as a purely

&quot;neighbourhood operators&quot;, which remove an important kind of arbitrariness that
has thus far been present in the attempt to treat quantum mechanics solely in

simulation and tests of basic quantum theory. Since quantum superpositions are
fragile, the major hurdle in building such a computer is overcoming noise.
  Developed over the last couple of years, new schemes for achieving fault
tolerance based on error detection, rather than error correction, appear to
tolerate as much as 3-6% noise per gate -- an order of magnitude better than
previous procedures. But proof techniques could not show that these promising
fault-tolerance schemes tolerated any noise at all.
  With an analysis based on decomposing complicated probability distributions
into mixtures of simpler ones, we rigorously prove the existence of constant
tolerable noise rates (&quot;noise thresholds&quot;) for error-detection-based schemes.
Numerical calculations indicate that the actual noise threshold this method
yields is lower-bounded by 0.1% noise per gate.

thermodynamics the area law widespread in quantum systems. Recently, a similar

superconducting charge qubits are capacitively coupled to a single high-Q
superconducting coplanar resonator. In this system, logical gates are realized
by driving the resonator with microwave fields. Advantages of this architecture
are that it allows for multi-qubit gates between non-nearest qubits and for the
realization of gates in parallel, opening the possibility of fault-tolerant
quantum computation with superconduting circuits. In this paper, we focus on
one and two-qubit gates that do not require moving away from the
charge-degeneracy `sweet spot'. This is advantageous as it helps to increase
the qubit dephasing time and does not require modification of the original
circuit QED. However these gates can, in some cases, be slower than those that
do not use this constraint. Five types of two-qubit gates are discussed, these
include gates based on virtual photons, real excitation of the resonator and a
gate based on the geometric phase. We also point out the importance of

two sides of the separating wall, which is the Dirichlet condition from the

spectra cause a difference in the quantum statistically emerging pressure on
the two sides. The net force acting on the separating wall proves to be nonzero
at any temperature and, after a weak decrease in the low temperature domain, to
increase and diverge with a square-root-of-temperature asymptotics for high

  Our uncertainty relation also yields a lower bound on the min-entropy key

Previously, the key uncertainty of these ciphers was only known with respect to

carrying is polarized single photons running circularly. It will be shown that
entanglement is not necessary for quantum secret sharing. Moreover, the
theoretic efficiency is improved to approach 100% as almost all the instances
can be used for generating the private key, and each photon can carry one bit

topological structure to complete quantum secret sharing with multi-level
two-particle entanglement in high capacity securely.

qubits in a quantum Heisenberg XY spin star environment in the thermodynamic
limit at arbitrarily finite temperatures is obtained using a novel operator
technique. In this approach, the transformed Hamiltonian becomes effectively
Jaynes-Cumming like and thus the analysis is also relevant to cavity quantum
electrodynamics. This special operator technique is mathematically simple and
physically clear, and allows us to treat systems and environments that could
all be strongly coupled mutually and internally. To study their entanglement
evolution, the concurrence of the reduced density matrix of the two coupled
central spins is also obtained exactly. It is shown that the dynamics of the
entanglement depends on the initial state of the system and the coupling
strength between the two coupled central spins, the thermal temperature of the
spin environment and the interaction between the constituents of the spin
environment. We also investigate the effect of detuning which in our model can
be controlled by the strength of a locally applied external magnetic field. It
is found that the detuning has a significant effect on the entanglement

a donor pair, we find that under certain conditions the exchange coupling (i.e.
2-qubit operation) between the respective electron pair at the interface may be

eigenstate determined by classical limiting conditions within it. This
description is in the context of an approach in which the path of each
relativistic particle in spacetime represents a fine-grained history for that
particle, and a path integral represents a coarse-grained history as a
superposition of paths meeting some criteria. Since spacetime paths are
parametrized by an invariant parameter, not time, histories based on such paths
do not evolve in time but are rather histories of all spacetime. Measurements
can then be represented by orthogonal states that correlate with specific
points in such coarse-grained histories, causing them to decohere, allowing a
consistent probability interpretation. This conception is applied here to the
analysis of the two slit experiment, scattering and, ultimately, the universe
as a whole. The decoherence of cosmological states of the universe then
provides the eigenstates from which our &quot;real&quot; universe can be selected by the
measurements carried out within it.

  states</title><description>  We address binary and quaternary communication channels based on correlated
multiphoton two-mode states of radiation in the presence of losses. The
protocol are based on photon number correlations and realized upon choosing a
shared set of thresholds to convert the outcome of a joint photon number
measurement into a symbol from a discrete alphabet. In particular, we focus on
channels build using feasible photon-number entangled states (PNES) as two-mode
coherently-correlated (TMC) or twin-beam (TWB) states and compare their
performances with that of channels built using feasible classically correlated
(separable) states. We found that PNES provide larger channel capacity in the
presence of loss, and that TWB-based channels may transmit a larger amount of
information than TMC-based ones at fixed energy and overall loss. Optimized bit
discrimination thresholds, as well as the corresponding maximized mutual
information, are explicitly evaluated as a function of the beam intensity and
the loss parameter. The propagation of TMC and TWB in lossy channels is
analyzed and the joint photon number distribution is evaluated, showing that
the beam statistics, either sub-Poissonian for TMC or super-Poissonian for TWB,
is not altered by losses. Although entanglement is not strictly needed to
establish the channels, which are based on photon-number correlations owned
also by separable mixed states, purity of the support state is relevant to
increase security. The joint requirement of correlation and purity individuates
PNES as a suitable choice to build effective channels. The effects of losses on
channel security are briefly discussed.

space. Subsystems specify factor spaces of the Hilbert space. An entangled
state corresponds semiclassically to a surface that cannot be decomposed into a
product of lower dimensional surfaces. Such a classical factorization never
exists for ergodic eigenstates of a chaotic Hamiltonian. The space of quantum
operators corresponds to a double phase space. The various representations of
the density operator then result from alternative choices of allowed coordinate
planes. In the case of the Wigner function and its Fourier transform, the chord
function, or the quantum characteristic function, this is a phase space on its
own. The reduced Wigner function, representing the partial trace of a density
operator over a subsystem is the projection of the original Wigner function;
the reduced chord function is obtained as a section. The purity of the reduced
density operator, the square of its trace, is a measure of entanglement,
obtained by integrating either the square of the reduced Wigner function, or
the square-modulus of the reduced chord function. Bell inequalities for general
parity measurements can be violated even for classical looking states with
positive Wigner functions that have evolved classically from product states.
These include the original EPR state. Entanglement with an unknown environment
results in decoherence. An example is that of the centre of mass of a large
number of independent particles, entangled with internal variables. In this
case, the Central Limit Theorem for Wigner functions leads to some aspects of
Markovian evolution for the reduced system.

perpetual attempt to recognize that the different aspects of nature are really
different aspects of the same thing. It is therefore interesting to combine
some, if not all, of Feynman's papers into one. The first of his three papers
is on the ``rest of the universe'' contained in his 1972 book on statistical
mechanics. The second idea is Feynman's parton picture which he presented in
1969 at the Stony Brook conference on high-energy physics. The third idea is
contained in the 1971 paper he published with his students, where they show
that the hadronic spectra on Regge trajectories are manifestations of
harmonic-oscillator degeneracies. In this report, we formulate these three
ideas using the mathematics of two coupled oscillators. It is shown that the
idea of entanglement is contained in his rest of the universe, and can be
extended to a space-time entanglement. It is shown also that his parton model
and the static quark model can be combined into one Lorentz-covariant entity.
Furthermore, Einstein's special relativity, based on the Lorentz group, can
also be formulated within the mathematical framework of two coupled
oscillators.

gravitational fields it should be a valid approximation. Such an approach could
be used to point out problems and prospects inherent in a more exact theory of
quantum gravity, yet to be discovered. Newtonian quantum gravity, e.g., shows
promise for prohibiting black holes altogether (which would eliminate
singularities and also solve the black hole information paradox), breaks the
equivalence principle of general relativity, and supports non-local
interactions (quantum entanglement). Its predictions should also be testable at
length scales well above the &quot;Planck scale&quot;, by high-precision experiments
feasible even with existing technology. As an illustration of the theory, it
turns out that the solar system, superficially, perfectly well can be described
as a quantum gravitational system, provided that the $l$ quantum number has its
maximum value, $n-1$. This results exactly in Kepler's third law. If also the
$m$ quantum number has its maximum value ($\pm l$) the probability density has
a very narrow torus-like form, centered around the classical planetary orbits.
However, as the probability density is independent of the azimuthal angle
$\phi$ there is, from quantum gravity arguments, no reason for planets to be
located in any unique place along the orbit (or even \textit{in} an orbit for
$m \neq \pm l$). This is, in essence, a reflection of the &quot;measurement problem&quot;
inherent in all quantum descriptions.

We find an upper bound on the squeezing parameter for the state to exhibit

  cavity</title><description>  A microscopic system under continuous observation exhibits at random times
sudden jumps between its states. The detection of this essential quantum
feature requires a quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement repeated many times
during the system evolution. Quantum jumps of trapped massive particles
(electrons, ions or molecules) have been observed, which is not the case of the
jumps of light quanta. Usual photodetectors absorb light and are thus unable to
detect the same photon twice. They must be replaced by a transparent counter
'seeing' photons without destroying them3. Moreover, the light has to be stored
over a duration much longer than the QND detection time. We have fulfilled
these challenging conditions and observed photon number quantum jumps.
Microwave photons are stored in a superconducting cavity for times in the
second range. They are repeatedly probed by a stream of non-absorbing atoms. An
atom interferometer measures the atomic dipole phase shift induced by the
non-resonant cavity field, so that the final atom state reveals directly the
presence of a single photon in the cavity. Sequences of hundreds of atoms
highly correlated in the same state, are interrupted by sudden
state-switchings. These telegraphic signals record, for the first time, the
birth, life and death of individual photons. Applying a similar QND procedure
to mesoscopic fields with tens of photons opens new perspectives for the
exploration of the quantum to classical boundary.

transformation (\phi,I) to (q,p) is singular for (q,p) = (0,0). Globally
{(q,p)} has the structure of the plane R^2, but {(phi,I)} that of the punctured
plane R^2 -(0,0). This implies qualitative differences for the QM of the two
phase spaces: The quantizing group for the plane R^2 consists of the (centrally
extended) translations generated by {q,p,1}, but the corresponding group for
{(phi,I)} is SO(1,2) = Sp(2,R)/Z_2, (Sp(2,R): symplectic group of the plane),
with Lie algebra basis {h_0 = I, h_1 = I cos phi, h_2 = - I sin phi}. In the QM
for the (phi,I)-model the three h_j correspond to self-adjoint generators K_j,
j=0,1,2, of irreducible unitary representations (positive discrete series) for
SO(1,2) or one of its infinitely many covering groups, the Bargmann index k &gt; 0
of which determines the ground state energy E (k, n=0) = hbar omega k of the
(phi,I)-Hamiltonian H(K). For an m-fold covering the lowest possible value is
k=1/m, which can be made arbitrarily small! The operators Q and P, now
expressed as functions of the K_j, keep their usual properties, but the richer
structure of the K_j quantum model of the HO is ``erased'' when passing to the
simpler Q,P model! The (phi,I)-variant of the HO implies many experimental
tests: Mulliken-type experiments for isotopic diatomic molecules, experiments
with harmonic traps for atoms, ions and BE-condensates, with the (Landau)
levels of charged particles in magnetic fields, with the propagation of light
in vacuum, passing through electric or magnetic fields. Finally it leads to a
new theoretical estimate for the quantum vacuum energy of fields and its
relation to the cosmological constant.

ancilla modes. The ancilla modes are prepared in an arbitrary product number
state. We construct the conditional, non unitary, signal transformations for an
arbitrary photon number count on each of the ancilla modes.

studied in two different scenarios. In one case, both oscillators are assumed
to be linear, whereas in the second case, one oscillator is linear and the
other is a non-linear, angular-momentum oscillator; the second case is, of
course, more complex in terms of energy transfer and dynamics. These two
scenarios have been the subject of much interest over the years, especially in
developing an understanding of modern concepts in quantum optics and quantum
electronics. In this work, however, these two scenarios are utilized to
consider and discuss the salient features of quantum behaviors resulting from
the interactive nature of the two oscillators, i.e., coherence, entanglement,
spontaneous emission, etc., and to apply a measure of entanglement in analyzing
the nature of the interacting systems. ... For the coupled linear and
angular-momentum oscillator system in the fully quantum-mechanical description,
we consider special examples of two, three, four-level angular momentum
systems, demonstrating the explicit appearances of entanglement. We also show
that this entanglement persists even as the coupled angular momentum oscillator
is taken to the limit of a large number of levels, a limit which would go over
to the classical picture for an uncoupled angular momentum oscillator.

to show that they enjoy the hydrodynamical properties of their classical

the general quantum macrostatistical scheme, presented in earlier works by the

  sub-Ohmic bath</title><description>  The decoherence of a two-state system coupled with a sub-Ohmic bath is
investigated theoretically by means of the perturbation approach based on a
unitary transformation. It is shown that the decoherence depends strongly and
sensitively on the structure of environment. Nonadiabatic effect is treated
through the introduction of a function $\xi_k$ which depends on the boson
frequency and renormalized tunneling. The results are as follows:(1) the
non-equilibrium correlation function $P(t)$, the dynamical susceptibility
$\chi''(\omega)$ and the equilibrium correlation function $C(t)$ are
analytically obtained for $s\leq 1$; (2) the phase diagram of thermodynamic
transition shows the delocalized-localized transition point $\alpha_l$ which
agrees with exact results and numerical data from the Numerical Renormalization
Group; (3) the dynamical transition point $\alpha_c$ between coherent and
incoherent phase is explicitly given for the first time. A crossover from the
coherent oscillation to incoherent relaxation appears with increasing coupling
(for $\alpha &gt; \alpha_c $, the coherent dynamics disappear); (4) the Shiba's
relation and sum rule are exactly satisfied when $\alpha \leq \alpha_c $; (5)
an underdamping-overdamping transition point $\alpha_c^{*}$ exists in the
function $S(\omega)$. Consequently, the dynamical phase diagrams in both ohmic
and sub-Ohmic case are mapped out. For $\Delta \ll \omega_c$, the critical
couplings ($\alpha_l, \alpha_c$ and $\alpha_c^{*}$) are proportional to
$\Delta^{1-s}$.

positive maps on density operators are used as constraints in placing bounds on
the entanglement of formation, the tangle, and the concurrence of 4 x N mixed
states. The maps are the partial transpose map and the $\Phi$-map introduced by
Breuer [H.-P. Breuer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 080501 (2006)]. The norm-based
entanglement measures constructed from these two maps, called negativity and
$\Phi$-negativity, respectively, lead to two sets of bounds on the entanglement
of formation, the tangle, and the concurrence. We compare these bounds and
identify the sets of 4 x N density operators for which the bounds from one
constraint are better than the bounds from the other. In the process, we
present a new derivation of the already known bound on the concurrence based on
the negativity. We compute new bounds on the three measures of entanglement
using both the constraints simultaneously. We demonstrate how such doubly
constrained bounds can be constructed. We discuss extensions of our results to
bipartite states of higher dimensions and with more than two constraints.

We will propose that the subspaces of von Neumann-Birkhoff lattices are too

nonorthogonal density states. The projection operator is motivated from cues

derives ultimate limitations on information processing tasks. These limits are
generally expressed in terms of entropic measures of information and
correlations. Here we answer the quantum information-theoretic question: ``How
correlated are two quantum systems from the perspective of a third?&quot; by solving
the following `quantum state redistribution' problem. Given an arbitrary
quantum state of three systems, where Alice holds two and Bob holds one, what
is the cost, in terms of quantum communication and entanglement, for Alice to
give one of her parts to Bob? The communication cost gives the first
operational interpretation to quantum conditional mutual information. The
optimal procedure is self-dual under time reversal and is perfectly composable.
This generalizes known protocols such as the state merging and fully quantum
Slepian-Wolf protocols, from which almost every known protocol in quantum
Shannon theory can be derived.

Non-perturbative terms can be organized into a sum over contributions from baby

total universe stable but non-BPS. The parent universe generates baby universes
by brane/anti-brane pair creation, and baby universes are correlated by
conservation of non-normalizable D-brane charges under the process. There are
no other source of entanglement of baby universes, and all possible states are

complexities of a fully-fledged field theory such as PQFT means that the
essential beauty of the relationships between these areas can be somewhat
obscured. Our intention is to display some, although not all, of these

quantum theory of non-commuting operators which do not depend on spacetime. The
combinatorial properties of these boson creation and annihilation operators,
which is our chosen example, may be described by graphs, analogous to the
Feynman diagrams of PQFT, which we show possess a Hopf algebra structure. Our

Entanglement can be generated by direct detection or balanced homodyne

transferred to the anti-Stokes fields in a readout process. By measuring the
operator moments of the anti-Stokes fields, we can verify the presence of
entanglement. We model the effects of practical factors such as Stokes field

The dispersion relations are the usual ones in terms of the index of refraction

$\Gamma_{aa}(k)\propto G^2_F k T^4$ is the active neutrino scattering rate and

the transition probability in the \emph{medium from expectation values in the

e^{-\Gamma_2 t}-2e^{-{1/2}(\Gamma_1+\Gamma_2)t} \cos\big(\Delta E t\big)] $ and

of positive operator measures (POMs), we consider certain aspects of a
quantization scheme in which a classical variable $f:\R^2\to \R$ is associated
with a unique positive operator measure (POM) $E^f$, which is not necessarily
projection valued. The motivation for such a scheme comes from the well-known
fact that due to the noise in a quantum measurement, the resulting outcome
distribution is given by a POM and cannot, in general, be described in terms of
a traditional observable, a selfadjoint operator. Accordingly, we notice that
the noiseless measurements are the ones which are determined by a selfadjoint
operator. The POM $E^f$ in our quantization is defined through its moment
operators, which are required to be of the form $\Gamma(f^k)$, $k\in \N$, with
$\Gamma$ a fixed map from classical variables to Hilbert space operators. In
particular, we consider the quantization of classical \emph{questions}, that
is, functions $f:\R^2\to\R$ taking only values 0 and 1. We compare two concrete
realizations of the map $\Gamma$ in view of their ability to produce noiseless
measurements: one being the Weyl map, and the other defined by using phase

decreasing order, where \sigma_2 is the second symmetric function of the

gedanken experiment. In our experiment, single photon described by a
superposition state with two terms dynamically interacts with an atom.
Preparation of the atom in any of two excited states can be realized
practically in the last moment before interaction. For atom in the first
excited state there is practically none dynamical interaction between atom and
photon so that the interference effects on the photon can be detected later by
a photo plate. For atom in the second excited state dynamical interaction
between photon and atom causes certainly the stimulated emission of a new
photon that moves coherently with the first photon. Both photons do a
super-system described by an entangled quantum state. But in this case photo
plate, that realizes simultaneously sub-systemic measurement at any photon,
does not detect interference effects. We suggest a simple explanation of given
as well as original variant of the delayed choice experiment in full agreement

even when they do not interact but when each of them interacts dispersively,
i.e., weak and far from the resonance with a single mode of the field.
Considering that regime we apply a method which makes use of a small nonlinear
deformation of the usual SU(2) algebra in order to obtain the effective
Hamiltonian describing correctly the dynamics for any initial states. In
particular we study two cases: In the first one we consider each atom initially
in a pure state and in the second case we assume that they start in a Werner
state. We find that both atoms can reach, periodically, maximum entanglement if
each of them starts in any eigenstate of the x-componet of the Pauli oprator,
independent of the initial Fock state of the mode. Thus we find that a
dispersive vacuum can generate entanglement between two two-level atoms. In the
second case and when the field mode is initially in a coherent or thermal
state, we find that in the high energy limit, in general, there is no
entanglement between the two atoms however at well defined moments the initial
entanglement is as suddenly recovered as removed. This time behavior looks like
narrow beats separated by the so called entanglement dead valleys.

  Entangled States</title><description>  The presence of loss limits the precision of an approach to phase measurement
using maximally entangled states, also referred to as NOON states. A
calculation using a simple beam-splitter model of loss shows that, for all
nonzero values L of the loss, phase measurement precision degrades with
increasing number N of entangled photons for N sufficiently large. For L above
a critical value of approximately 0.785, phase measurement precision degrades
with increasing N for all values of N. For L near zero, phase measurement
precision improves with increasing N down to a limiting precision of
approximately 1.018 L radians, attained at N approximately equal to 2.218/L,
and degrades as N increases beyond this value. Phase measurement precision with
multiple measurements and a fixed total number of photons N_T is also examined.
For L above a critical value of approximately 0.586, the ratio of phase
measurement precision attainable with NOON states to that attainable by
conventional methods using unentangled coherent states degrades with increasing
N, the number of entangled photons employed in a single measurement, for all
values of N. For L near zero this ratio is optimized by using approximately
N=1.279/L entangled photons in each measurement, yielding a precision of
approximately 1.340 sqrt(L/N_T) radians.

between a wide range of techniques for storage and retrieval of photon wave

pulse-propagation control via off-resonant Raman techniques, and
photon-echo-based techniques. In the present paper, we generalize this

case of Doppler-broadened atoms and assume that there is a negligible
difference between the Doppler shifts of the two optical transitions. In this
situation, we show that, at high enough optical depth, all atoms contribute
coherently to the storage process as if the medium were homogeneously
broadened. We also discuss the effects of inhomogeneous broadening in solid

reversing the inhomogeneous broadening during the storage time, as well as
suggest a way for achieving high efficiencies with a nonreversible
inhomogeneous profile.

Here, we analyze the above Kerr interaction by employing a continuous-time
multi-mode model for the input/output fields to/from the nonlinear medium. In
contrast to previous single-mode treatments of this problem, our analysis takes
into account the full temporal content of the free-field input beams as well as
the non-instantaneous response of the medium. The main implication of this
model, in which the cross-Kerr phase shift on one input is proportional to the
photon flux of the other input, is the existence of phase noise terms at the
output. We show that these phase noise terms will preclude satisfactory

deterministic computing for scalar initial-value problems for ordinary
differential equations of order k. For systems of equations of the first order
this question has been settled modulo some details in \cite{Kacewicz05}. A
speed-up over deterministic computing shown in \cite{Kacewicz05} is related to
the increased regularity of the solution with respect to that of the right-hand
side function. For a scalar equation of order k (which can be transformed into
a special system of the first order), the regularity of the solution is
increased by k orders of magnitude. This leads to improved complexity bounds
depending on k for linear information in the deterministic setting, see
\cite{Szczesny05}. This may suggest that in the randomized and quantum settings
a speed-up can also be achieved depending on k.
  We show in this paper that a speed-up dependent on k is not possible in the
randomized and quantum settings. We establish lower complexity bounds, showing
that the randomized and quantum complexities remain at the some level as for
systems of the first order, no matter how large k is. Thus, the algorithms from
\cite{Kacewicz05} remain (almost) optimal, even if we restrict ourselves to a
subclass of systems arising from scalar equations of order k.

  unconditional results</title><description>  It is known that any quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism that works
within the framework of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) must perform highly
entangled measurements across \Omega(n \log n) coset states. One of the only
known models for how such a measurement could be carried out efficiently is
Kuperberg's algorithm for the HSP in the dihedral group, in which quantum
states are adaptively combined and measured according to the decomposition of
tensor products into irreducible representations. This ``quantum sieve'' starts
with coset states, and works its way down towards representations whose
probabilities differ depending on, for example, whether the hidden subgroup is
trivial or nontrivial.
  In this paper we show that no such approach can produce a polynomial-time
quantum algorithm for Graph Isomorphism. Specifically, we consider the natural
reduction of Graph Isomorphism to the HSP over the the wreath product S_n\wr
Z_2. Using a recently proved bound on the irreducible characters of S_n, we
show that no algorithm in this family can solve Graph Isomorphism in less than
e^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})} time, no matter what adaptive rule it uses to select and
combine quantum states. In particular, algorithms of this type can offer
essentially no improvement over the best known classical algorithms, which run
in time e^{O(\sqrt{n \log n})}.

i.e. they involve a single additional probe qudit, and optimal, i.e. they
provide the maximum amount of information compatible with a given level of
disturbance. The performances of optimal single-user schemes in extracting
information by sequential measurements in a N -user transmission line are also
investigated, and the optimality is analyzed by explicit evaluation of

the transmission fidelity decreases with N . The resulting trade-off is no

representation determines the sign of energy and other quantities defined as
generators of continuous symmetries of the system in question, so that it would
appear that principles like conservation of energy for a compound system may
hold or fail depending on relative choices of conjugacy class of
representations of its subsystems. We show that for any finite set of quantum
systems there are exactly two ways of choosing conjugacy classes of
representations consistent with the usual tensor-product construction for
representing the compound system composed of these. Each is obtained from the
other by reversing the conjugacy of all the representations at once. The
relation of unitary equivalence for representations of a single system is
therefore uniquely extendible to representations of all systems that can
interact with it.

coding has a monotonic relationship with the logarithmic negativity, an
important entanglement measure, for certain classes of continuous variable (CV)
quantum states of practical significance. These are the two-mode squeezed
states and the non-Gaussian states obtained from them by photon subtraction.
This monotonic correspondence can be expressed analytically in the case of pure
states. Numerical analysis shows that this relationship holds to a very good
approximation even in the mixed state case of the photon-subtracted squeezed
states. The Fisher information is evaluated by the CV Bell measurement in the
limit of weak signal modulation. Our results suggest that the logarithmic
negativity of certain sets of non-Gaussian mixed states can be experimentally
accessed without homodyne tomography, leading to significant simplification of
the experimental procedure.

  Classical Mechanics</title><description>  Geometrical formulation of classical mechanics with forces that are not
necessarily potential-generated is presented. It is shown that a natural
geometrical &quot;playground&quot; for a mechanical system of point particles lacking
Lagrangian and/or Hamiltonian description is an odd dimensional line element
contact bundle. Time evolution is governed by certain canonical two-form
$\Omega$ (an analog of $dp/\dq-dH/\dt$), which is constructed purely from
forces and the metric tensor entering the kinetic energy of the system. Attempt
to &quot;dissipative quantization&quot; in terms of the two-form $\Omega$ is proposed.
The Feynman's path integral over histories of the system is rearranged to a
&quot;world-sheet&quot; functional integral. The &quot;umbilical string&quot; surfaces entering the
theory connect the classical trajectory of the system and the given Feynman
history. In the special case of potential-generated forces, &quot;world-sheet&quot;
approach precisely reduces to the standard quantum mechanics. However, a
transition probability amplitude expressed in terms of &quot;string functional

quantum-state-assignment methods to a three-level quantum system. The
statistical operator assigned on the evidence of various measurement data and
kinds of prior knowledge is computed partly analytically, partly through
numerical integration (in eight dimensions) on a computer. The measurement data
consist in absolute frequencies of the outcomes of N identical von Neumann
projective measurements performed on N identically prepared three-level
systems. Various small values of N as well as the large-N limit are considered.
Two kinds of prior knowledge are used: one represented by a plausibility
distribution constant in respect of the convex structure of the set of
statistical operators; the other represented by a Gaussian-like distribution
centred on a pure statistical operator, and thus reflecting a situation in
which one has useful prior knowledge about the likely preparation of the
system.
  In a companion paper the case of measurement data consisting in average

heat bath and the external field, the low-frequency asymptotic of the power
spectrum is modified both qualitatively and quantitatively. The new term in the
power spectrum is inversely proportional to, but is odd in frequency. It comes
from the connected part of the correlation function, and is related to the
temperature and external field corrections to the photon and charge carrier
propagators. In application to the case of a biased conducting sample, this
term gives rise to a contribution to the voltage power spectrum which is
proportional to the absolute system temperature, the charge carrier mobility,
the bias voltage squared, and a factor describing dependence of the noise
intensity on the sample geometry. It is verified that the derived expression is
in agreement with the experimental data on 1/f-noise measurements in metal

particular, cryptographic systems require &quot;strong&quot; RBGs that produce
high-entropy bit sequences, but traditional software pseudo-RBGs have very low
entropy content and therefore are relatively weak for cryptography. Hardware
RBGs yield entropy from chaotic or quantum physical systems and therefore are
expected to exhibit high entropy, but in current implementations their exact
entropy content is unknown. Here we report a quantum random bit generator
(QRBG) that harvests entropy by measuring single-photon and entangled
two-photon polarization states. We introduce and implement a quantum
tomographic method to measure a lower bound on the &quot;min-entropy&quot; of the system,
and we employ this value to distill a truly random bit sequence. This approach
is secure: even if an attacker takes control of the source of optical states, a
secure random sequence can be distilled.

previous constructions. This improves the construction by Kempe and Regev, who
were the first to prove that 3-local Hamiltonian is complete for the complexity
class QMA, the quantum analogue of NP.
  Quantum k-SAT, a restricted version of the local Hamiltonian problem using
only projector terms, was introduced by Bravyi as an analogue of the classical
k-SAT problem. Bravyi proved that quantum 4-SAT is complete for the class QMA
with one-sided error (QMA_1) and that quantum 2-SAT is in P. We give an
encoding of a quantum circuit into a quantum 4-SAT Hamiltonian using only
3-local terms. As an intermediate step to this 3-local construction, we show
that quantum 3-SAT for particles with dimensions 3x2x2 (a qutrit and two

a quantum open subsystem are initially prepared in two types of states: the
product states and the Bell states. The bath, which consists of $N$ (in the
thermodynamic limit $N\to\infty$) mutually coupled spins-1/2, is in a thermal
state at the beginning. By the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, the model can
be treated effectively as two spin qubits embedded in a single mode cavity. The
time-evolution of the purity, z-component summation and the concurrence of the
central spins can be determined by a Laguerre polynomial scheme. It is found
that (i) at a low temperature, the uncoupled subsystem in a product state can
be entangled due to the interaction with bath, which is tested by the
Peres-Horodecki separability; however, at a high temperature, the bath produces
a stronger destroy effect on the purity and entanglement of the subsystem; (ii)
when the coupling strength between the two central spins is large, they are
protected strongly against the bath; (iii) when the interaction between the
subsystem and the bath is strong, the collapse of the two spin qubits from
their initial entangled state is fast.

This contrasts a recent conclusion of Bartlett et al. that this takes a

which are individually trapped in two spatially separated cavities that are
connected by an optical fibre. We show that an extremely entangled state of the
two atoms can be deterministically generated through both photon emission of
the $\Lambda$-type atom and photon absorption of the V-type atom in an ideal

it seems that the entanglement is an essential tool to find an unknown ground

rigorously defined, so it has not been known (for example) what mixed states

operational definition, from which we prove (by considering Werner states and
Isotropic states) that steerable states are a strict subset of the entangled

For arbitrary bipartite Gaussian states we derive a linear matrix inequality
that decides the question of steerability via Gaussian measurements, and we

  Experiment using a Super-Focused Laser Beam</title><description>  The generally accepted view in quantum theory is that information about which
way the quantum system traveled and interference visibility are complementary.
In all which-way experiments, however, an intervention takes place in the
interference process in order to determine which way the quantum system took.
This intervention can imply the tagging of a which-way marker to a quantum
system or, for instance, blocking off one of the paths in a Mach-Zehnder
interferometer so that one indirectly knows that the quantum system took the
other (open) path. It is, however, this intervention that destroys the
interference. In this paper a novel two-slit which-way interference experiment
will be discussed and proposed for implementation that provides maximum
which-way information without intervening in the interference process so that
simultaneously maximum interference visibility remains preserved. This, in
fact, implies an uncoupling of which-way information from interference and
consequently also entails violating the duality relation P^2+V^2&lt;1. Basically,
the purpose of the proposed experiment and of this paper is to scrutinize this
duality relation. The experiment makes use of a super-focused laser beam that

lead to new phenomena signalling the unification of gravity with the other
fundamental interactions. Various recent theoretical frameworks indicate a
possible window for non-Newtonian forces with gravitational coupling strength
in the micrometre range. The major expected background in the same range is
attributable to the Casimir force or variants of it if dielectric materials,
rather than conducting ones, are considered. Here we review the measurements of
the Casimir force performed so far in the micrometre range and how they
determine constraints on non-Newtonian gravitation, also discussing the
dominant sources of false signals. We also propose a geometry-independent
parameterization of all data in terms of the measurement of the constant c. Any
Casimir force measurement should lead, once all corrections are taken into
account, to a determination of the constant c which, in order to assess the
accuracy of the measurement, can be compared with its more precise value known
through microscopic measurements. Although the last decade of experiments has
resulted in solid demonstrations of the Casimir force, the situation is not
conclusive with respect to being able to discover new physics. Future
experiments and novel phenomenological analysis will be necessary to discover
non-Newtonian forces or to push the window for their possible existence into
regions of the parameter space which theoretically appear unnatural.

These goals can be achieved, for instance, via teleportation. Here we show that
the design of efficient quantum communication protocols in quantum networks

one qubit via the off-resonance Jaynes-Cummings interaction with different
interaction times for the two subsystems. First, we consider the case of the CV
system prepared in a Bell-like superposition and investigate the conditions for
maximum entanglement transfer. Then we analyze the general case of two-mode CV

part of a tripartite system and, on the basis of measurements on their
respective parts, each infers a quantum state for the third part S. We denote
the conditioned states which Alice and Bob assign to S by alpha and beta
respectively, while the unconditioned state of S is rho. The state assigned by
an overseer, who has all the data available to Alice and Bob, is omega. The
pooler is told only alpha, beta, and rho. We show that for certain classes of
tripartite states, this information is enough for her to reconstruct omega by
the formula omega \propto alpha rho^{-1} beta. Specifically, we identify two
classes of states for which this pooling formula works: (i) all pure states for
which the rank of rho is equal to the product of the ranks of the states of
Alice's and Bob's subsystems; (ii) all mixtures of tripartite product states
that are mutually orthogonal on S.

the exact expressions for the evolution of the reduced density matrix both in
momentum and configuration space and the vacuum and the thermal contribution to

interacting spin chains in the limit where the corresponding circuit in
parameter space is shrunk to a point and the number of spins is extended to
infinity; for finite circuit radii or finite spin chain lengths, the geometric
phase is always trivial (a multiple of 2pi). In this work, by contrast, two
related signatures of criticality are proposed which obey finite-size scaling
and which circumvent the need for assuming any unphysical limits. They are
based on the notion of the Bargmann invariant whose phase may be regarded as a
discretized version of Berry's phase. As circuits are considered which are
composed of a discrete, finite set of vertices in parameter space, they are
able to pass directly through a critical point, rather than having to
circumnavigate it. The proposed mechanism is shown to provide a diagnostic tool
for criticality in the case of a given non-solvable one-dimensional spin chain
with nearest-neighbour interactions in the presence of an external magnetic
field.

  time-dependent bias pulses</title><description>  The quantum dynamics of a two-state system (qubit) can be governed by means
of external control parameters present in time-dependent bias pulses of special
forms. We consider the class of biases for which the time evolution equation
without a dissipation can be solved exactly. Concentrating for definiteness on
the flux qubit we calculate the probability of the definite direction of the
current in the loop and its time-averaged values as functions of the qubit's
control parameters both analytically and solving numerically the equation of
motion for the density matrix in the presence of relaxation and decoherence. It
is shown that there exist such time-dependent biases that the definite current
direction probability with no dissipation taken into account becomes a
monotonously growing function of time tending to a value which may exceed 1/2.
We also calculate the probability to find the system in the excited state and
show the possibility of the inverse population in a properly driven two-state
system provided the relaxation and dephasing rates are small enough.

goes below the shot-noise limit by 3.25 dB. The number of temporal modes
contained in the twin-beam, as well as the size of the twin coherence areas,

Besides, the probability to find the particle in any finite domain of phase

the attacker Eve modulates not only the phases but also the amplitude in the
superposition of the single-photon states which she sends to the receiver.
Concentrating especially on the &quot;discretized gaussian&quot; intensity modulation, we
show that our attack is more effective than the individual attack, which had
been the best attack up to present. As a result of this, the recent experiment
with communication distance of 100km reported by Diamanti et al. turns out to
be insecure. Moreover it can be shown that in a practical experimental setup
which is commonly used today, the communication distance achievable by the
DPSQKD protocol is less than 95km.

  Thermodynamics</title><description>  We discuss and motivate the form of the generator of a nonlinear quantum
dynamical group 'designed' so as to accomplish a unification of quantum
mechanics (QM) and thermodynamics. We call this nonrelativistic theory Quantum
Thermodynamics (QT). Its conceptual foundations differ from those of (von
Neumann) quantum statistical mechanics (QSM) and (Jaynes) quantum information
theory (QIT), but for thermodynamic equilibrium (TE) states it reduces to the
same mathematics, and for zero entropy states it reduces to standard unitary
QM. The nonlinear dynamical group of QT is construed so that the second law
emerges as a theorem of existence and uniqueness of a stable equilibrium state
for each set of mean values of the energy and the number of constituents. It
implements two fundamental ansatzs. The first is that in addition to the
standard QM states described by idempotent density operators (zero entropy), a
strictly isolated system admits also states that must be described by
non-idempotent density operators (nonzero entropy). The second is that for such
additional states the law of causal evolution is determined by the simultaneous
action of a Schroedinger-von Neumann-type Hamiltonian generator and a nonlinear
dissipative generator which conserves the mean values of the energy and the
number of constituents, and (in forward time) drives any density operator, no
matter how far from TE, in the 'direction' of steepest entropy ascent (maximal
entropy increase). The equation of motion can be solved not only in forward
time, to describe relaxation towards TE, but also backwards in time, to
reconstruct the 'ancestral' or primordial lowest entropy state or limit cycle
from which the system originates.

re-examined. Neither argument is found to be satisfactory as it stands,
although an improved version of one of the arguments can in fact be given. This
improved version turns out to be still not completely unproblematic, but it is
argued that it contains only a single actual loophole, which is identical to a
loophole that remains in experimental proofs of nonlocality of Bell-type. It is
concluded that - within the context of the standard quantum kinematical
framework and in agreement with what has been concluded by earlier authors - a
nonlinear dynamics of density operators is inconsistent with relativistic
causality. However, it is also stressed that this conclusion in itself has
little implication for the nature of dynamics at the Hilbert space level - in
particular, it does not force dynamics to be linear at this level - nor does it
continue to be valid in contexts that go beyond the standard quantum
kinematical framework. Despite their seeming triviality, these last two points
have not always been appreciated in the literature. Finally, it is also pointed
out that the argument for complete positivity, as given in conjunction with one
of the two recent arguments for linear dynamics, in fact only establishes a
condition that is weaker than complete positivity.

as a cross-Kerr interaction between each ion and the field.

freedom in electrical gate-defined quantum dots can be coherently coupled to
light. This is achieved via electron-electron interaction or via electron
tunneling into a proximal self-assembled quantum dot. We illustrate potential
applications of this approach by considering several quantum control
techniques, including optical read-out of gate-controlled semiconductor quantum
bits and controlled generation of entangled photon-spin pairs.

configurations may be simply and transparently computed using the Green's
function approach pioneered by Schwinger. Not only can total energies and
surface forces be computed in this way, but local energy densities, and in
general, all components of the vacuum expectation value of the energy-momentum
tensor may be calculated. For simple geometries this approach may be carried
out exactly, which yields insight into what happens in less tractable
situations. In this talk I will concentrate on the example of a scalar field in
a circular cylindrical delta-function background. This situation is quite
similar to that of a spherical delta-function background. The local energy
density in these cases diverges as the surface of the background is approached,
but these divergences are integrable. The total energy is finite in strong
coupling, but in weak coupling a divergence occurs in third order. This
universal feature is shown to reflect a divergence in the energy associated
with the surface, the integrated local energy density within the shell itself,
which surface energy should be removable by a process of renormalization.

mechanical propositions with modal operators. This enlargement allows to refer
consistently to actual and possible properties of the system. By means of a
topological argument, more precisely in terms of the existence of sections of
sheaves, we give an extended version of Kochen-Specker theorem over this new
structure. This allows us to prove that contextuality remains a central feature
even in the enriched propositional system.

improvement in their spreading rate and mixing times respectively. The addition
of decoherence to the quantum walk produces a more uniform distribution on the
line, and even faster mixing on the cycle by removing the need for
time-averaging to obtain a uniform distribution. We calculate numerically the
entanglement between the coin and the position of the quantum walker and show
that the optimal decoherence rates are such that all the entanglement is just
removed by the time the final measurement is made.

  incomplete?</title><description>  In loving memory of Asher Peres, we discuss a most important and influential
paper written in 1935 by his thesis supervisor and mentor Nathan Rosen,
together with Albert Einstein and Boris Podolsky. In that paper, the trio known
as EPR questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics. The authors argued
that the then-new theory should not be considered final because they believed
it incapable of describing physical reality. The epic battle between Einstein
and Bohr intensified following the latter's response later the same year. Three
decades elapsed before John S. Bell gave a devastating proof that the EPR
argument was fatally flawed. The modest purpose of our paper is to give a
critical analysis of the original EPR paper and point out its logical
shortcomings in a way that could have been done 70 years ago, with no need to
wait for Bell's theorem. We also present an overview of Bohr's response in the
interest of showing how it failed to address the gist of the EPR argument.

situation inspired by quantum dots, where a short-range interaction is added to
an harmonic confinement.

dimensional relativistic scalar field model. The Bohm-de Broglie interpretation
is applied and the quantum potential is viewed as modifying the Minkowski
geometry. In such a way singularities appear in the metric, opening the
possibility, following Holland, of interpreting the EPR correlations as
originated by a wormhole effective geometry, through which physical signals can
propagate.

related to the problem of finding minimal length paths in a particular curved
geometry [Nielsen et al, Science 311, 1133-1135 (2006)]. This paper
investigates many of the basic geometric objects associated to this space,
including the Levi-Civita connection, the geodesic equation, the curvature, and
the Jacobi equation. We show that the optimal Hamiltonian evolution for
synthesis of a desired unitary necessarily obeys a simple universal geodesic
equation. As a consequence, once the initial value of the Hamiltonian is set,
subsequent changes to the Hamiltonian are completely determined by the geodesic
equation. We develop many analytic solutions to the geodesic equation, and a
set of invariants that completely determine the geodesics. We investigate the
problem of finding minimal geodesics through a desired unitary, U, and develop
a procedure which allows us to deform the (known) geodesics of a simple and
well understood metric to the geodesics of the metric of interest in quantum
computation. This deformation procedure is illustrated using some three-qubit
numerical examples. We study the computational complexity of evaluating
distances on Riemmanian manifolds, and show that no efficient classical
algorithm for this problem exists, subject to the assumption that good
pseudorandom generators exist. Finally, we develop a canonical extension
procedure for unitary operations which allows ancilla qubits to be incorporated
into the geometric approach to quantum computing.
