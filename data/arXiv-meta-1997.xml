following a sequence of results suggesting that quantum computers are more
powerful than classical probabilistic computers. Following Shor's result that
factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in
quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of NP can be
efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this
question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, with
probability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in
time $o(2^{n/2})$. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen
uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class $NP \cap coNP$ cannot be
solved on a quantum Turing machine in time $o(2^{n/3})$. The former bound is
tight since recent work of Grover shows how to accept the class NP relative to
any oracle on a quantum computer in time $O(2^{n/2})$.

  Counting Quantum Turing Machine</title><description>  It was recently shown that a generalization of quantum Turing machines
(QTMs), in which potentials are associated with elementary steps or transitions
of the computation, generates potential distributions along computation paths
of states in some basis B. The distributions are computable and are thus
periodic or have deterministic disorder. These generalized machines (GQTMs) can
be used to investigate the effect of potentials in causing reflections and
reducing the completion probability of computations. This work is extended here
by determination of the spectral and transmission properties of an example GQTM
which enumerates the integers as binary strings. A potential is associated with
just one type of step. For many computation paths the potential distributions
are initial segments of a quasiperiodic distribution that corresponds to a
substitution sequence. The energy band spectra and Landauer Resistance (LR) are
calculated for energies below the barrier height by use of transfer matrices.
The LR fluctuates rapidly with momentum with minima close to or at band-gap
edges. For several values of the parameters, there is good transmission over
some momentum regions.

with an added Kerr effect-like nonlinearity are studied as a function of the
intra-cavity photon number. The competition between the second and the third
order non-linearities shifts the Hopf bifurcation of the standard SHG towards
higher intra-cavity energies eventually completely stabilizing the system.
Remarkably, the noise suppression is at the same time strongly enhanced, so
that almost perfect squeezing is obtained for arbitrarily large intra-cavity
photon numbers. Possible experimental implementations are finally discussed.

anisotropic. For two plates there is resonant dissipation for all frequencies

  coherent and intelligent states</title><description>  We introduce the concept of algebra eigenstates which are defined for an
arbitrary Lie group as eigenstates of elements of the corresponding complex Lie
algebra. We show that this concept unifies different definitions of coherent
states associated with a dynamical symmetry group. On the one hand, algebra
eigenstates include different sets of Perelomov's generalized coherent states.
On the other hand, intelligent states (which are squeezed states for a system
of general symmetry) also form a subset of algebra eigenstates. We develop the
general formalism and apply it to the SU(2) and SU(1,1) simple Lie groups.
Complete solutions to the general eigenvalue problem are found in the both
cases, by a method that employs analytic representations of the algebra
eigenstates. This analytic method also enables us to obtain exact closed
expressions for quantum statistical properties of an arbitrary algebra
eigenstate. Important special cases such as standard coherent states and
intelligent states are examined and relations between them are studied by using
their analytic representations.

that it undergoes the effect of delocalization in momentum when the classical
diffusional threshold is obeyed.
 For this case the ratio between the oscillator frequency and the frequency of
the kick is a rational number, strictly in analogy with the classical case that
does not obey the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem as the unperturbed motion is
degenerate.
 A tight-binding formulation is derived showing that there is not
delocalization in momentum for irrational ratio of the above frequencies. In
this way, it is straightforwardly seen that the behavior of the quantum kicked
rotator is strictly similar to the one of the quantum kicked harmonic
oscillator, although the former, in the classical limit, obeys the
Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem.

reduce systematic errors below a fixed threshold. Then, we calculate the
statistical errors, intrinsic in the procedure that gives the density matrix.
We present a detailed study of such errors versus the detectors quantum
efficiency $\eta$ and the matrix indexes in the number representation, for
different radiation states. For unit quantum efficiency, and for both coherent
and squeezed states, the statistical errors of the diagonal matrix elements
saturate for large n. On the contrary, off-diagonal errors increase with the
distance from the diagonal. For non unit quantum efficiency the statistical
errors along the diagonal do not saturate, and increase dramatically versus
both $1-\eta$ and the matrix indexes.

phase - is now a well assessed method for ``measuring'' the quantum state. In
this paper I will show how it can be used as a kind of universal detection, for
measuring generic field operators, however at expense of some additional noise.
The general class of field operators that can be measured in this way is
presented, and includes also operators that are inaccessible to heterodyne
detection. The noise from tomographical homodyning is compared to that from
heterodyning, for those operators that can be measured in both ways. It turns
out that for some operators homodyning is better than heterodyning when the
mean photon number is sufficiently small. Finally, the robustness of the method
to additive phase-insensitive noise is analyzed. It is shown that just half
photon of thermal noise would spoil the measurement completely.

generally-covariant Galilean-relativistic limit-form of Einstein's theory of
gravity known as the Newton-Cartan theory. According to this theory, space is
flat, time is absolute with instantaneous causal influences, and the degenerate
`metric' structure of spacetime remains fixed with two mutually orthogonal
non-dynamical metrics, one spatial and the other temporal. The spacetime
according to this theory is, nevertheless, curved, duly respecting the
principle of equivalence, and the non-metric gravitational connection-field is
dynamical in the sense that it is determined by matter distributions. Here,
this generally-covariant but Galilean-relativistic theory of gravity with a
possible non-zero cosmological constant, viewed as a parameterized gauge theory
of a gravitational vector-potential minimally coupled to a complex
Schroedinger-field (bosonic or fermionic), is successfully cast -- for the
first time -- into a manifestly covariant Lagrangian form. Then, exploiting the
fact that Newton-Cartan spacetime is intrinsically globally-hyperbolic with a
fixed causal structure, the theory is recast both into a constraint-free
Hamiltonian form in 3+1-dimensions and into a manifestly covariant reduced
phase-space form with non-degenerate symplectic structure in 4-dimensions.
Next, this Newton-Cartan-Schroedinger system is non-perturbatively quantized
using the standard C*-algebraic technique combined with the geometric procedure
of manifestly covariant phase-space quantization. The ensuing unitary quantum
field theory of Newtonian gravity coupled to Galilean-relativistic matter is
not only generally-covariant, but also exactly soluble.

consideration. We show that via the ``purification'' ansatz, statistical
mixtures can also be consistently reconstructed via the quantum Bayesian
inference scheme. In this case the estimation corresponds to averaging over the
generalized canonical ensemble of states satisfying the given constraints, and
the reconstructed density operator maximizes the von Neumann entropy (i.e.,
this density operator is equal to the generalized canonical density operator
which follows from the Jaynes principle of maximum entropy). We study in detail
the reconstruction of the spin-1/2 density operator and discuss the logical
connection between the three reconstruction schemes, i.e., (1) quantum Bayesian
inference, (2) reconstruction via the Jaynes principle of maximum entropy, and
(3) discrete quantum tomography.

performed with present technology to test local realism. Quantum mechanics
violate this inequality a factor of 1.5. In contrast, quantum mechanics
violates previous inequalities (for example, Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt

the form of a 1+1-dimensional non-critical string theory, which can be
formulated in terms of (dual) Dirichlet branes, according to modern
perspectives. We suggest that the MTs are the microsites in the brain, for the
emergence of stable, macroscopic quantum coherent states, identifiable with the
``preconscious states''. Quantum space-time effects, as described by
non-critical string theory, trigger then an ``organized collapse'' of the
coherent states down to a specific or ``conscious state''. The whole process we
estimate to take O(1 sec), in excellent agreement with a plethora of
experimental/observational findings. The complete integrability of the stringy
model for MT proves sufficient in providing a satisfactory solution to memory
coding and capacity. Such features might turn out to be important for a model

microsystem, is the result of coupling to a much larger macrosystem (or
reservoir) which is so large that one has no chance of keeping track of all of
its degrees of freedom. The microsystem evolution is then described by tracing
over the reservoir states, resulting in an irreversible decay as excitation
leaks out of the initially excited microsystems into the outer reservoir
environment. Earlier treatments of this dissipation described an ensemble of
microsystems using density matrices, either in Schroedinger picture with Master
equations, or in Heisenberg picture with Langevin equations. The development of
experimental techniques to study single quantum systems (for example single
trapped ions, or cavity radiation field modes) has stimulated the construction
of theoretical methods to describe individual realizations conditioned on a
particular observation record of the decay channel, in the environment. These
methods, variously described as Quantum Jump, Monte Carlo Wavefunction and
Quantum Trajectory methods are the subject of this review article. We discuss
their derivation, apply them to a number of current problems in quantum optics
and relate them to ensemble descriptions.

steps only. The Landauer Resistance (LR) and band spectra were determined for
the tight binding Hamiltonians associated with the GCQTM for energies both
above and below the potential height. For parameters and potentials in the
electron region, the LR fluctuates rapidly between very high and very low
values as a function of momentum. The rapidity and extent of the fluctuations
increases rapidly with increasing N. For N=18, the largest value considered,
the LR shows good transmission probability as a function of momentum with
numerous holes of very high LR values present. This is true for energies above

perspective centered on quantum conditional and mutual entropies. This approach
parallels the description of classical error correction in Shannon theory,
while clarifying the differences between classical and quantum codes. More
specifically, it is shown how quantum information theory accounts for the fact
that &quot;redundant&quot; information can be distributed over quantum bits even though
this does not violate the quantum &quot;no-cloning&quot; theorem. Such a remarkable
feature, which has no counterpart for classical codes, is related to the
property that the ternary mutual entropy vanishes for a tripartite system in a
pure state. This information-theoretic description of quantum coding is used to
derive the quantum analogue of the Singleton bound on the number of logical
bits that can be preserved by a code of fixed length which can recover a given
number of errors.

with a single pointlike scatterer inside. It is found that the spectrum shows
chaotic (random-matrix-like) characteristics when the inverse of the formal
strength $\bar{v}^{-1}$ is within a band whose width increases parabolically as
a function of the energy. This implies that the spectrum becomes
random-matrix-like at very high energy irrespective to the value of the formal
strength. The predictions are confirmed by numerical experiments with a
rectangular box. The findings for a pointlike scatterer are applied to the case
for a small but finite-size impurity. We clarify the proper procedure for its
zero-size limit which involves non-trivial divergence. The previously known
results in one and two-dimensional quantum billiards with small impurities

of the physical degrees of freedom can be used to store binary information and
the corresponding binary variables satisfy some given logic relations if and
only if the system is in the ground state. Two theorems are proved showing that
the universal static quantum computer can encode the solutions for any P and NP
problem into its ground state using only polynomial number (in the problem
input size) of logic gates. The second step is to read out the solutions by
relaxing the system. The time complexity is relevant when one tries to read out
the solution by relaxing the system, therefore our model of static quantum
computation provides a new connection between the computational complexity and

We show that different applications may result in different channel capacities.
Upper bounds on several of these capacities are proved. These bounds are based
on the coherent information, which plays a role in quantum information theory
analogous to that played by the mutual information in classical information
theory. Many new properties of the coherent information and entanglement
fidelity are proved. Two non-classical features of the coherent information are
demonstrated: the failure of subadditivity, and the failure of the pipelining
inequality. Both properties arise as a consequence of quantum entanglement, and
give quantum information new features not found in classical information
theory. The problem of a noisy quantum channel with a classical observer
measuring the environment is introduced, and bounds on the corresponding
channel capacity proved. These bounds are always greater than for the

if there is no further major axiom in quantum physics than those formulated for
example in Dirac's `Quantum Mechanics', then a quantum physicist would not be
able to tell a torus from a hole in the ground. We argue that there are indeed
such axioms involving vectors in the domain of the Hamiltonian: The
``probability densities'' (hermitean forms) \psi^\dagger \chi for \psi,\chi in
this domain generate an algebra from which the classical configuration space
with its topology (and with further refinements of the axiom, its C^K and
C^infinity structures) can be reconstructed using Gel'fand - Naimark theory.
Classical topology is an attribute of only certain quantum states for these
axioms, the configuration space emergent from quantum physics getting
progressively less differentiable with increasingly higher excitations of
energy and eventually altogether ceasing to exist. After formulating these
axioms, we apply them to show the possibility of topology change and to discuss
quantized fuzzy topologies. Fundamental issues concerning the role of time in

classical symplectic symmetry in quantum mechanics is investigated. General
expressions are derived for the quantum potential in both configuration space
and momentum space representations. By comparing the configuration space and
momentum space representations of the causal interpretation of quantum

exists between these two representations in classical mechanics. In addition,
it is shown that the quantum potential in configuration space may be expressed
as the sum of a momentum dispersion energy and a spatial localisation energy; a
complementary expression for the quantum potential being found in the momentum

interpretations in the philosophical literature. After an introduction to the
many-minds idea, the complexity of quantum states for macroscopic objects is
stressed. Then it is proposed that a characterization of the physical structure
of observers is a proper goal for physical theory. It is argued that an
observer cannot be defined merely by the instantaneous structure of a brain,
but that the history of the brain's functioning must also be taken into
account. Next the nature of probability in many-minds interpretations is
discussed and it is suggested that only discrete probability models are needed.
The paper concludes with brief comments on issues of actuality and identity

form of a `reversible' pebble game. While such simulations incur little
overhead in additional computation time, they use a large amount of additional
memory space during the computation. The reacheable reversible simulation
instantaneous descriptions (pebble configurations) are characterized
completely. As a corollary we obtain the reversible simulation by Bennett and
that among all simulations that can be modelled by the pebble game, Bennett's
simulation is optimal in that it uses the least auxiliary space for the
greatest number of simulated steps. One can reduce the auxiliary storage
overhead incurred by the reversible simulation at the cost of allowing limited
erasing leading to an irreversibility-space tradeoff. We show that in this
resource-bounded setting the limited erasing needs to be performed at precise
instants during the simulation. We show that the reversible simulation can be
modified so that it is applicable also when the simulated computation time is
unknown.

  Metrics</title><description>  We consider a family of prior probability distributions of particular
interest, all being defined on the three-dimensional convex set of two-level
quantum systems. Each distribution is, following recent work of Petz and Sudar,
taken to be proportional to the volume element of a monotone metric on that
Riemannian manifold. We apply an entropy-based test (a variant of one recently
developed by Clarke) to determine which of two priors is more noninformative in
nature. This involves converting them to posterior probability distributions
based on some set of hypothesized outcomes of measurements of the quantum
system in question. It is, then, ascertained whether or not the original
relative entropy (Kullback-Leibler distance) between a pair of priors increases
or decreases when one of them is exchanged with its corresponding posterior.
The findings lead us to assert that the maximal monotone metric yields the most
noninformative (prior) distribution and the minimal monotone (that is, the
Bures) metric, the least. Our conclusions both agree and disagree, in certain
respects, with ones recently reached by Hall, who relied upon a less specific
test criterion than our entropy-based one.

irreversibility cost of an otherwise reversible computation without

models in which the initial and final conditions are independently specified,
and several authors have investigated experimental tests of such models.
  We point out here that GMH time-neutral models can allow superluminal
signalling, in the sense that it can be possible for observers in those
cosmologies, by detecting and exploiting regularities in the final state, to
construct devices which send and receive signals between space-like separated
points. In suitable cosmologies, any single superluminal message can be
transmitted with probability arbitrarily close to one by the use of redundant
signals. However, the outcome probabilities of quantum measurements generally
depend on precisely which past {\it and future} measurements take place. As the
transmission of any signal relies on quantum measurements, its transmission
probability is similarly context-dependent. As a result, the standard
superluminal signalling paradoxes do not apply. Despite their unusual features,
the models are internally consistent.
  These results illustrate an interesting conceptual point. The standard view
of Minkowski causality is not an absolutely indispensable part of the
mathematical formalism of relativistic quantum theory. It is contingent on the
empirical observation that naturally occurring ensembles can be naturally
pre-selected but not post-selected.

  Emitting Lasers</title><description>  We investigate the polarization fluctuations caused by quantum noise in
quantum well vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs). Langevin
equations are derived on the basis of a generalized rate equation model in
which the influence of competing gain-loss and frequency anisotropies is
included. This reveals how the anisotropies and the quantum well confinement
effects shape the correlations and the magnitude of fluctuations in ellipticity
and in polarization direction. According to our results all parameters used in
the rate equations may be obtained experimentally from precise time resolved
measurements of the intensity and polarization fluctuations in the emitted
laser light. To clarify the effects of anisotropies and of quantum well
confinement on the laser process in VCSELs we therefore propose time resolved
measurements of the polarization fluctuations in the laser light. In
particular, such measurements allow to distinguish the effects of frequency
anisotropy and of gain-loss anisotropy and would provide data on the spin
relaxation rate in the quantum well structure during cw operation as well as
representing a new way of experimentally determinig the linewidth enhancement

ways that are not possible using conventional, incoherent feedback control. In

quantum Zeno effect (freezing of the state). Only if the quantum measurement is
fuzzy, continuous monitoring gives a readout E(t) from which information about
the dynamical development of the state vector of the system may be obtained in
certain cases. This is studied in detail. Fuzziness is thereby introduced with
the help of restricted path integrals equivalent to non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.
For an otherwise undisturbed multilevel system it is shown that this
measurement represents a model of decoherence. If it lasts long enough, the
measurement readout discriminates between the energy levels and the von Neumann
state reduction is obtained. For a two-level system under resonance influence
(which undergoes in absence of measurement Rabi oscillations between the
levels) different regimes of measurement are specified depending on its
duration and fuzziness: 1) the Zeno regime where the measurement results in a
freezing of the transitions between the levels and 2) the Rabi regime when the
transitions maintain. It is shown that in the Rabi regime at the border to the
Zeno regime a correlation exists between the time dependent measurement readout
and the modified Rabi oscillations of the state of the measured system.
Possible realizations of continuous fuzzy measurements of energy are sketched.

  This is a critical review of the literature on many-worlds interpretations
(MWI), with arguments drawn partly from earlier critiques by Bell and Stein.
The essential postulates involved in various MWI are extracted, and their
consistency with the evident physical world is examined. Arguments are
presented against MWI proposed by Everett, Graham and DeWitt. The relevance of
frequency operators to MWI is examined; it is argued that frequency operator
theorems of Hartle and Farhi-Goldstone-Gutmann do not in themselves provide a
probability interpretation for quantum mechanics, and thus neither support
existing MWI nor would be useful in constructing new MWI. Comments are made on
papers by Geroch and Deutsch that advocate MWI. It is concluded that no
plausible set of axioms exists for an MWI that describes known physics.

unknown intrinsic energy components, they depend on the physical environment by
way of external potentials. Due to these statistical qualities and wave
function normalization, non-locality is inherent to the fundamental relations
of Planck, de Broglie and Schroedinger. A local formulation of these statements
is introduced and briefly assessed, the modified and local Schroedinger
equation is non-linear. Quantum measurements are analyzed in detail, the exact
interplay between causal and statistical reasons in a measurement process can
be accounted for. Examples of individual measurement effects in quantum theory
are given, the treatment of diffraction experiments, neutron interferences,
quantum erasers, the quantum Zeno effect, and interaction-free measurements can
be described consistent with the suggested framework. The paper additionally
provides a strictly local and deterministic calculation of interactions in a

formalism which derives its validity in measurements from considering every

demonstrates how these can be used for distributed computation with minimal
communication between various processors. The problem considered is that of
estimating the mean of N items to a certain precision. First a serial quantum
mechanical algorithm for this is presented that is faster than any classical
algorithm. Next it is shown how this can be efficiently parallelized with
quantum mechanical processors that are remotely located. These processors
consist of coupled EPR particles. Each processor has just to communicate one

  multiplicity problem of SU(n): (I) Littlewood rule and a complementary group
  of SU(n)</title><description>  A complementary group to SU(n) is found that realizes all features of the
Littlewood rule for Kronecker products of SU(n) representations. This is
accomplished by considering a state of SU(n) to be a special Gel'fand state
of the complementary group {\cal U}(2n-2). The labels of {\cal U}(2n-2) can
be used as the outer multiplicity labels needed to distinguish multiple
occurrences of irreducible representations (irreps) in the SU(n)\times
SU(n)\downarrow SU(n) decomposition that is obtained from the Littlewood rule.
Furthermore, this realization can be used to determine SU(n)\supset
SU(n-1)\times U(1) Reduced Wigner Coefficients (RWCs) and Clebsch-Gordan
Coefficients (CGCs) of SU(n), using algebraic or numeric methods, in either
the canonical or a noncanonical basis. The method is recursive in that it uses
simpler RWCs or CGCs with one symmetric irrep in conjunction with standard
recoupling procedures. New explicit formulae for the multiplicity for SU(3)
and SU(4) are used to illustrate the theory.

coefficients for the coupling (\lambda_{1}\mu_{1})\times
(\lambda_{2}\mu_{2})\downarrow (\lambda\mu)^{\eta}, where \eta is the outer
multiplicity label needed in the decomposition, is proposed based on a
recoupling approach according to the complementary group technique given in
(I). It is proved that the non-multiplicity-free reduced Wigner coefficients of
SU(n) are not unique with respect to canonical outer multiplicity labels, and
can be transformed from one set of outer multiplicity labels to another. The
transformation matrices are elements of SO(m), where m is the number of
occurrence of the corresponding irrep (\lambda\mu) in the decomposition
(\lambda_{1}\mu_{1})\times (\lambda_{2}\mu_{2})\downarrow (\lambda\mu). Thus, a
kind of the reduced Wigner coefficients with multiplicity is obtained after a
special SO(m) transformation. New features of this kind of reduced Wigner
coefficients and the differences from the reduced Wigner coefficients with
other choice of the multiplicity label given previously are discussed. The
method can also be applied to the derivation of general SU(n) Wigner or reduced
Wigner coefficients with multiplicity. Algebraic expression of another kind of
reduced Wigner coefficients, the so-called reduced auxiliary Wigner
coefficients for SU(3)\supset U(2), are also obtained.

crossing problem. It is pointed out that weak and strong potential curve
crossing interactions are interchanged under this transformation, and thus
realizing a naive strong and weak duality. A reliable perturbation theory
should thus be formulated in the both limits of weak and strong interactions.
In fact, main characteristics of the potential crossing phenomena such as the
Landau-Zener formula including its numerical coefficient are well-described by
simple (time-independent) perturbation theory without referring to Stokes
phenomena. We also show that quantum coherence in a double well potential is
generally suppressed by the effect of potential curve crossing, which is
analogous to the effect of Ohmic dissipation on quantum coherence.

find one-dimensional quantum codes of length n=13 and 15 that correct burst

that corrects t=3 errors must have length n &gt; 18. In general, we show that it
is possible to build quantum burst-correcting codes that have near optimal
dimension. For example, we show that for any constant b, there exist
b-burst-correcting quantum codes with length n, and dimension k=n-log n -O(b);
as a comparison, the Hamming bound for the case with t (constant) random errors
yields k &lt; n - t log n - O(1) .

describing the evolution of an individual physical system in terms of the

relation to Quantum Mechanics as Bohmian Mechanics but which differ from the
latter for what concerns the trajectories followed by the particles. Obviously,
one has to impose on the hypothetical alternative theory precise physical
requirements. We analyse various such constraints and we show step by step how
to meet them. This way of attacking the problem allows to recall and focus on
some relevant features of Bohm's theory. One of the central requirements we
impose on the models we are going to analyse has to do with their
transformation properties under the transformations of the extended Galilei
group. In a context like the one we are interested in one can put forward
various requests that we refer to as physical and genuine covariance and
invariance. Other fundamental requests are that the theory allows the
description of isolated physical systems as well as that it leads to a solution
(in the same sense as Bohmian Mechanics) of the measurement problem. We show
that there are infinitely many inequivalent (from the point of view of the
trajectories) bohmian-like theories reproducing the predictions of Quantum
Mechanics.

The formalism is checked for cases such as a simple model of a double barrier

  Theory</title><description>  The geometry of decoherence in generalized &quot;consistent histories&quot; quantum
theory is explored, revealing properties of the theory that are independent of
any particular application of it. It is shown how the decoherence functional of
a closed quantum system may be regarded as an Hermitian form on the space of
linear operators on the Hilbert space of the system. This identification makes
manifest a number of structural properties of decoherence functionals. For
example, a bound on the maximum number of histories in a consistent set is
determined. When the decoherence functional is positive -- as in conventional
quantum mechanics -- it defines a semi-inner product on the space of history
operators. This shows that consistent sets of histories are just orthogonal
sets in this inner product. It further implies the existence in general of
Cauchy-Schwarz and triangle inequalities for positive decoherence functionals.
The geometrical significance of the ILS theorem classifying all possible
decoherence functionals is illuminated, and a version of the ILS theorem for
decoherence functionals on class operators is given. The class of history
operators consistent according to a given decoherence functional is found, and,
conversely, it is shown how to construct the decoherence functionals according
to which a given set of histories is consistent. More generally, the
&quot;geometric&quot; point of view here developed supplies a powerful unified language
with which to solve problems in generalized quantum theory.

spacetime metric signatures. However, the Clifford algebras associated with
each are inequivalent, R(4) in the first case (real 4 by 4 matrices), H(2) in
the latter (quaternionic 2 by 2). Multivector reformulations of Dirac theory by
various authors look quite inequivalent pending the algebra assumed. It is not
clear if this is mere artifact, or if there is a right/wrong choice as to which
one describes reality. However, recently it has been shown that one can map
from one signature to the other using a &quot;tilt transformation&quot; [see P. Lounesto,
&quot;Clifford Algebras and Hestenes Spinors&quot;, Found. Phys. 23, 1203-1237 (1993)].
The broader question is that if the universe is signature blind, then perhaps a
complete theory should be manifestly tilt covariant. A generalized multivector
wave equation is proposed which is fully signature invariant in form, because
it includes all the components of the algebra in the wavefunction (instead of
restricting it to half) as well as all the possibilities for interaction terms.

the case of codes of minimum distance 2; thus, it makes sense to examine such
codes in the hopes that techniques that prove effective there will generalize.
With this in mind, we present a number of results on codes of minimum distance
2. We first compute the linear programming bound on the dimension of such a
code, then show that this bound can only be attained when the code either is of
even length, or is of length 3 or 5. We next consider questions of uniqueness,
showing that the optimal code of length 2 or 4 is unique (implying that the
well-known one-qubit-in-five single-error correcting code is unique), and
presenting nonadditive optimal codes of all greater even lengths. Finally, we
compute the full automorphism group of the more important distance 2 codes,
allowing us to determine the full automorphism group of any GF(4)-linear code.

theory for systems of interacting q-particles. These particles obey exotic
statistics and are the q-generalization of the colored particles which appear
in many problems of condensed matter physics, magnetism and quantum optics.
Motivated by the general ideas of standard field theory we prove the
q-functional analogues of Hori's formulation of Wick's theorems for the
different ordered q-particle creation and annihilation operators. The
formulae have the same formal expressions as fermionic and bosonic ones but
differ by a nature of fields. This allows us to derive the perturbation series
for the theory and develop analogues of standard quantum field theory
constructions in q-functional form.

published before the famous works by Heisenberg and Schr\&quot;odinger, and
contemporary with the fundamental works of L. de Broglie. In that paper, one
can find the basic formulae and their interpretation as they were adopted by
Feynman twenty years later. We believe that Wentzel's work was forgotten for
several reasons: (I) Schr\&quot;odinger's equation was much simpler to deal with
(Wentzel himself contributed to its development in the same way as L.Brillouin
and H.Kramers did). (II) The first application was rejected by Heisenberg and
Kramers. (III) The approximation used by Wentzel was too na\&quot;\i ve and failed.
Nevertheless, the foundation laid by Wentzel was sound, as it has been shown by
Feynman's work. Therefore, Wentzel has to be considered as one of the founders
of quantum mechanics.

Bayesian theory yields the common asymptotic (minimax and maximin) redundancy
of universal data compression in a parametric setting. We seek a possible
analogue of this result for the two-level {\it quantum} systems. We restrict
our considerations to prior probability distributions belonging to a certain
one-parameter family, $q(u)$, $-\infty &lt; u &lt; 1$. Within this setting, we are
able to compute exact redundancy formulas, for which we find the asymptotic
limits. We compare our quantum asymptotic redundancy formulas to those derived
by naively applying the classical counterparts of Clarke and Barron, and find
certain common features. Our results are based on formulas we obtain for the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $2^n \times 2^n$ (Bayesian density) matrices,
$\zeta_{n}(u)$. These matrices are the weighted averages (with respect to
$q(u)$) of all possible tensor products of $n$ identical $2 \times 2$ density
matrices, representing the two-level quantum systems. We propose a form of
{\it universal} coding for the situation in which the density matrix
describing an ensemble of quantum signal states is unknown. A sequence of $n$

SS for n observables X_i can be constructed as eigenstates of their linear
complex combinations or as states which minimize the Robertson uncertainty
relation. When X_i close a Lie algebra L the generalized SS could also be
introduced as orbit of Aut(L^C). It is shown that for the nilpotent algebra h_N
the three generalizations are equivalent. For the simple su(1,1) the family of
eigenstates of uK_- + vK_+ (K_\pm being lowering and raising operators) is a
family of ideal K_1-K_2 SS, but it cannot be represented as an Aut(su^C(1,1))
orbit although the SU(1,1) group related coherent states (CS) with symmetry are
contained in it.
  Eigenstates |z,u,v,w;k&gt; of general combination uK_- + vK_+ + wK_3 of the
three generators K_j of SU(1,1) in the representations with Bargman index k =

the large particle is also coupled to a thermal environment producing the
decoherence necessary for classicality. The effective theory is obtained by
tracing out both the environment and the small particle variables. It consists
of a formula for the probabilities of a set of histories of the large particle,

has the form of an almost classical particle coupled to a stochastic variable
whose probabilities are determined by a formula very similar to that given by
quantum measurement theory for continuous measurements of the small particle's

system as continuously and imprecisely measured by the classical system. The
effective equations of motion for the classical system therefore consist of
treating the quantum variable $x$ as a stochastic c-number $\x (t) $ the
probability distibution for which is given by the theory of continuous quantum
measurements. The resulting theory is similar to the usual mean field equations
(in which $x$ is replaced by its quantum expectation value) but with two
differences: a noise term, and more importantly, the state of the quantum
subsystem evolves according to the stochastic non-linear Schrodinger equation
of a continuously measured system. In the case in which the quantum system
starts out in a superposition of well-separated localized states, the classical
system goes into a statistical mixture of trajectories, one trajectory for each
individual localized state.

this higher order pole. This microphysical state is a mixture of non-reducible

the polynomial time-dependence which one always associates with higher order

reduction through a foliating family of spacelike surfaces. That is because
evaporating black hole geometries cannot be foliated by a non-singular family
of spacelike surfaces. A four-dimensional notion of information is reviewed.
Although complete information may not be available on every spacelike surface,
information is not lost in a spacetime sense in an evaporating black hole
spacetime. Rather complete information is distributed about the
four-dimensional spacetime. Black hole evaporation is thus not in conflict with
the principles of quantum mechanics when suitably generally stated. (Talk

unpredictability means not knowing which of a set of alternatives is the actual
one; determining the actual alternative yields information. The degree of
unpredictability is neatly quantified by the information measure introduced by
Shannon. This perspective is applied to three kinds of unpredictability in
physics: the absolute unpredictability of quantum mechanics, the
unpredictability of the coarse-grained future due to classical chaos, and the
unpredictability of open systems. The incompatibility of the first two of these
is the root of the difficulty in defining quantum chaos, whereas the
unpredictability of open systems, it is suggested, can provide a unified
characterization of chaos in classical and quantum dynamics.

its origin less than two years ago. Encoded quantum information can be
protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the
environment. Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional
mistakes occur during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum
information can be processed without serious propagation of errors. Hence, an
arbitrarily long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that
the average probability of error per quantum gate is less than a certain
critical value, the accuracy threshold. A quantum computer storing about 10^6
qubits, with a probability of error per quantum gate of order 10^{-6}, would be
a formidable factoring engine. Even a smaller, less accurate quantum computer
would be able to perform many useful tasks. (This paper is based on a talk

where the parties are supplied with an extra resource: particles in an

cannot be used to simulate a communication channel, it can reduce the
communication complexity of functions in some cases. Specifically, we show
that, for a particular function among three parties (each of which possesses
part of the function's input), a prior quantum entanglement enables them to
learn the value of the function with only three bits of communication occurring
among the parties, whereas, without quantum entanglement, four bits of
communication are necessary. We also show that, for a particular two-party
probabilistic communication complexity problem, quantum entanglement results in
less communication than is required with only classical random correlations
(instead of quantum entanglement). These results are a noteworthy contrast to
the well-known fact that quantum entanglement cannot be used to actually
simulate communication among remote parties.

choices among alternative approaches. I list some of these ``forks in the
road'' and offer reasons for taking one alternative over the other. In
particular, I advocate the following: the sum-over-histories framework for
quantum dynamics over the ``observable and state-vector'' framework; relative
probabilities over absolute ones; spacetime over space as the gravitational
``substance'' (4 over 3+1); a Lorentzian metric over a Riemannian
(``Euclidean'') one; a dynamical topology over an absolute one; degenerate
metrics over closed timelike curves to mediate topology-change; ``unimodular
gravity'' over the unrestricted functional integral; and taking a discrete
underlying structure (the causal set) rather than the differentiable manifold
as the basis of the theory.
  In connection with these choices, I also mention some results from unimodular
quantum cosmology, sketch an account of the origin of black hole entropy,
summarize an argument that the quantum mechanical measurement scheme breaks
down for quantum field theory, and offer a reason why the cosmological constant
of the present epoch might have a magnitude of around $10^{-120}$ in natural
units.

ratios of gamma functions) are found between the average polarizations with

observation that the coherent states of the Heisenberg-Weyl, $su(2)$,
$su(r+1)$, $su(1,1)$ and $su(r,1)$ algebras in certain symmetric (bosonic)
representations give the ``probability amplitudes'' (or the ``square roots'')

negative multinomial distributions in probability theory. New probability
distributions are derived based on coherent states of the classical algebras
$B_r$, $C_r$ and $D_r$ in symmetric representations. These new probability
distributions are simple generalisation of the multinomial distributions with
some added new features reflecting the quantum and Lie algebraic construction.
As byproducts, simple proofs and interpretation of addition theorems of Hermite
polynomials are obtained from the `coordinate' representation of the (negative)
multinomial states. In other words, these addition theorems are higher rank
counterparts of the well-known generating function of Hermite polynomials,
which is essentially the `coordinate' representation of the ordinary

network respectively, whereas forward propagation maps a one-way propagation of
logical implication, from input to output. Conversely, hard NP-complete
problems are characterized by a two-way propagation of logical implication from
input to output and vice versa, given that both are partly defined from the
beginning. Logical implication can be propagated forward and backward in a
computation by constructing the gate array corresponding to the entire
reversible Boolean network and constraining output bits as well as input bits.
The possibility of modeling the physical process undergone by such a network by

renormalization. We contrast physical results obtained using dimensional
regularization and cutoff schemes and show explicitly that in certain cases
dimensional regularization fails to reproduce the results obtained using cutoff
regularization. First we consider a delta-function potential in arbitrary space
dimensions. Using cutoff regularization we show that for $d \ge 4$ the
renormalized scattering amplitude is trivial. In contrast, dimensional
regularization can yield a nontrivial scattering amplitude for odd dimensions
greater than or equal to five. We also consider a potential consisting of a
delta function plus the derivative-squared of a delta function in three
dimensions. We show that the renormalized scattering amplitudes obtained using
the two regularization schemes are different. Moreover we find that in the
cutoff-regulated calculation the effective range is necessarily negative in the
limit that the cutoff is taken to infinity. In contrast, in dimensional
regularization the effective range is unconstrained. We discuss how these
discrepancies arise from the dimensional regularization prescription that all
power-law divergences vanish. We argue that these results demonstrate that
dimensional regularization can fail in a non-perturbative setting.

In this paper we show how to ``engineer'' a squeezed-bath-type interaction for
an effective two-level system. In the simplest example, our two-level atom is
represented by the two ground levels of an atom with angular momentum J=1/2 -&gt;
J=1/2 transition (a four level system) which is driven by (weak) laser fields
and coupled to the vacuum reservoir of radiation modes. Interference between
the spontaneous emission channels in optical pumping leads to a squeezed bath
type coupling, and thus to symmetry breaking of decay on the Bloch sphere. With
this system it should be possible to observe the effects predicted in the
context of squeezed bath - atom interactions. The laser parameters allow one to
choose properties of the squeezed bath interaction, such as the (effective)
photon number expectation number N and the squeezing phase phi. We present
results of a detailed analytical and numerical study.

completely random order. To find someone's phone number with a probability of
50%, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need
to access the database a minimum of O(N) times. Quantum mechanical systems can
be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By

that the probe measurement satisfies the projection postulate, a new formula

mechanical effects, namely generalised Casimir forces, on any scatterer.
  Symmetries of vacuum therefore raise fundamental questions when confronted
with the principle of relativity of motion in vacuum. The specific case of
uniformly accelerated motion is particularly interesting, in connection with
the much debated question of the appearance of vacuum in accelerated frames.
The choice of Rindler representation, commonly used in General Relativity,
transforms vacuum fluctuations into thermal fluctuations, raising difficulties
of interpretation. In contrast, the conformal representation of uniformly
accelerated frames fits the symmetry properties of field propagation and
quantum vacuum and thus leads to extend the principle of relativity of motion
to uniform accelerations.
  Mirrors moving in vacuum with a non uniform acceleration are known to
radiate. The associated radiation reaction force is directly connected to
fluctuating forces felt by motionless mirrors through fluctuation-dissipation
relations. Scatterers in vacuum undergo a quantum Brownian motion which
describes irreducible quantum fluctuations. Vacuum fluctuations impose ultimate
limitations on measurements of position in space-time, and thus challenge the
very concept of space-time localisation within a quantum framework.
  For test masses greater than Planck mass, the ultimate limit in localisation
is determined by gravitational vacuum fluctuations. Not only positions in
space-time, but also geodesic distances, behave as quantum variables,
reflecting the necessary quantum nature of an underlying geometry.

nature of physical observables. It has been known for a long time that
Poincar\'e symmetry of field theory can be extended to the larger conformal
symmetry. We use these symmetries to define quantum observables associated with
positions in space-time, in the spirit of Einstein theory of relativity. This
conception of localisation may be applied to massive as well as massless
fields. Localisation observables are defined as to obey Lorentz covariant
commutations relations and in particular include a time observable conjugated
to energy. Whilst position components do not commute in presence of a
non-vanishing spin, they still satisfy quantum relations which generalise the
differential laws of classical relativity. We also give of these observables a
representation in terms of canonical spatial positions, canonical spin
components and a proper time operator conjugated to mass. These results plead
for a new representation not only of space-time localisation but also of
motion.

from a trap in the recent MIT experiment (Phys. Rev. Lett., 78 (1997) 582) is
established with a simple many-boson system of two states with linear coupling.
Its exact solution for the many-body problem shows a factorization of dynamical

product of a vacuum state and a coherent state remains in a direct product of
two coherent states at any instance in the evolution of the total system. This
conclusion always holds even for a system with a finite average particle number
in the initial state. Its thermodynamical limit can be directly dealt with in
the Bogoliubov approximation and manifests that an ideal condensate in the trap
will remain in a coherent state after the r.f. interaction while the
output-coupler pulse of atoms is also in a coherent state, which means a
coherent output of atomic beam to form a macroscopic quantum state in a

probability of a non-relativistic particle crossing $x=0$ during an interval of
time. For a system consisting of a single non-relativistic particle, histories
coarse-grained according to whether or not they pass through spacetime regions
are generally not decoherent, except for very special initial states, and thus
probabilities cannot be assigned. Decoherence may, however, be achieved by
coupling the particle to an environment consisting of a set of harmonic
oscillators in a thermal bath. Probabilities for spacetime coarse grainings are
thus calculated by considering restricted density operator propagators of the
quantum Brownian motion model. We also show how to achieve decoherence by
replicating the system $N$ times and then projecting onto the number density of
particles that cross during a given time interval, and this gives an
alternative expression for the crossing probability. The latter approach shows
that the relative frequency for histories is approximately decoherent for
sufficiently large $N$, a result related to the Finkelstein-Graham-Hartle
theorem.

Hilbert space. The space of rays has, naturally, the structure of a K\&quot;ahler
manifold. This leads to a geometrical formulation of the postulates of quantum
mechanics which, although equivalent to the standard algebraic formulation, has
a very different appearance. In particular, states are now represented by
points of a symplectic manifold (which happens to have, in addition, a
compatible Riemannian metric), observables are represented by certain
real-valued functions on this space and the Schr\&quot;odinger evolution is captured
by the symplectic flow generated by a Hamiltonian function. There is thus a
remarkable similarity with the standard symplectic formulation of classical
mechanics. Features---such as uncertainties and state vector reductions---which
are specific to quantum mechanics can also be formulated geometrically but now
refer to the Riemannian metric---a structure which is absent in classical
mechanics. The geometrical formulation sheds considerable light on a number of
issues such as the second quantization procedure, the role of coherent states
in semi-classical considerations and the WKB approximation. More importantly,
it suggests generalizations of quantum mechanics. The simplest among these are
equivalent to the dynamical generalizations that have appeared in the
literature. The geometrical reformulation provides a unified framework to
discuss these and to correct a misconception. Finally, it also suggests
directions in which more radical generalizations may be found.

value had previously been conjectured to be a lower bound. We use the method
introduced by Shor and Smolin of concatenating a non-random (cat) code within a
random code to obtain good codes. The cat code with block size five is shown to
be optimal for single concatenation. The best known multiple-concatenated code

of the inner code states.

decision trees. A natural classical algorithm is to then run a random walk on
the tree, starting at the root, to see if the tree contains a node n levels
from the root. We devise a quantum mechanical algorithm that evolves a state,
initially localized at the root, through the tree. We prove that if the
classical strategy succeeds in reaching level n in time polynomial in n, then
so does the quantum algorithm. Moreover, we find examples of trees for which
the classical algorithm requires time exponential in n, but for which the
quantum algorithm succeeds in polynomial time. The examples we have so far,
however, could also be solved in polynomial time by different classical
algorithms.

  Chaotic Eigenstates</title><description>  The approach is developed for the description of isolated Fermi-systems with
finite number of particles, such as complex atoms, nuclei, atomic clusters etc.
It is based on statistical properties of chaotic excited states which are
formed by the interaction between particles. New type of ``microcanonical''
partition function is introduced and expressed in terms of the average shape of
eigenstates $F(E_k,E)$ where $E$ is the total energy of the system. This
partition function plays the same role as the canonical expression
$exp(-E^{(i)}/T)$ for open systems in thermal bath. The approach allows to
calculate mean values and non-diagonal matrix elements of different operators.
In particular, the following problems have been considered: distribution of
occupation numbers and its relevance to the canonical and Fermi-Dirac
distributions; criteria of equilibrium and thermalization; thermodynamical
equation of state and the meaning of temperature, entropy and heat capacity,
increase of effective temperature due to the interaction. The problems of
spreading widths and shape of the eigenstates are also studied.

entanglement purification; that is, the transformation of a partially entangled

alternate purely local operations with one- or two-way classical communication.
In the present work, we consider a more general, but simpler, class of

separable superoperator, bounds on separable superoperators apply as well to
EPPs; we use this fact to give a new upper bound on the rate of EPPs on
Bell-diagonal states, and thus on the capacity of Bell-diagonal channels.

Although these solutions can be associated with definite charge, linear

quantum mechanics where there is no role for an additional symmetry due to
nondegeneracy, matrix hamiltonians allow for non-trivial residual symmetries.
This approach is based on a generalization of the intertwining relations
familiar in SUSY Quantum Mechanics. The corresponding matrix supercharges, of
first or of second order in derivatives, lead to an algebra which incorporates
an additional block diagonal differential matrix operator (referred to as a
&quot;hidden&quot; symmetry operator) found to commute with the superhamiltonian. We
discuss some physical interpretations of such dynamical systems in terms of
spin 1/2 particle in a magnetic field or in terms of coupled channel problem.

characterized by a loss, a quantity that depends on the channel input and the
quantum operation performed by the channel. The loss reflects the transmission
quality: if the loss is zero, quantum information can be perfectly transmitted
at a rate measured by the quantum source entropy. By using block coding based
on sequences of n entangled symbols, the average loss (defined as the overall
loss of the joint n-symbol channel divided by n, when n tends to infinity) can
be made lower than the loss for a single use of the channel. In this context,
we examine several upper bounds on the rate at which quantum information can be
transmitted reliably via a noisy channel, that is, with an asymptotically
vanishing average loss while the one-symbol loss of the channel is non-zero.
These bounds on the channel capacity rely on the entropic Singleton bound on
quantum error-correcting codes [Phys. Rev. A 56, 1721 (1997)]. Finally, we
analyze the Singleton bounds when the noisy quantum channel is supplemented
with a classical auxiliary channel.

state. By applying local operations and communicating with each other using a
classical channel, Alice and Bob can manipulate it into some other states.
Previous investigations of entanglement manipulations have been largely limited
to a small number of strategies and their average outcomes. Here we consider a
general entanglement manipulation strategy and go beyond the average property.
For a pure entangled state shared between two separated persons Alice and Bob,
we show that the mathematical interchange symmetry of the Schmidt decomposition
can be promoted into a physical symmetry between the actions of Alice and Bob.
Consequently, the most general (multi-step two-way-communications) strategy of
entanglement manipulation of a pure state is, in fact, equivalent to a strategy
involving only a single (generalized) measurement by Alice followed by one-way
communications of its result to Bob. We also prove that strategies with one-way
communications are generally more powerful than those without communications.
In summary, one-way communications is necessary and sufficient for the
entanglement manipulations of a pure bipartite state. The supremum probability
of obtaining a maximally entangled state (of any dimension) from an arbitrary
state is determined and a strategy for achieving this probability is
constructed explicitly. One important question is whether collective
manipulations in quantum mechanics can greatly enhance the probability of large
deviations from the average behavior. We answer this question in the negative
for a specific problem.

However, the feedback mechanism can never compensate the dissipative effects of

  The possibility of using the properties of the Schmidt decomposition to

  Another algorithm is proposed that selects the consistent set (formed using
Schmidt projections) with the highest Shannon information. This is applied to a
simple model and shown to produce physically sensible histories. The theory is
capable of unconditional probabilistic prediction for closed quantum systems,
and is strong enough to be falsifiable. Ideas on applying the theory to more

of view that `experience only makes statements of this type: an observer has
made a certain observation; and never any like this: a physical quantity has a
certain value.' The supposition that the observables of a system `possess'
objective values is purely idealistic. According to the SI view, the state-
vector collapse cannot result from the Schroedinger evolution of a system (even
with its environment), but only from the empirical production of a mathematical
symbol, irreducible to the quantum level. The production of a symbol always
takes some time. Thus the state-vector collapse cannot be instantaneous
(Schneider 1994), a specific prediction of the present model.
  From this interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, the appearances of the body
are the result of state-vector collapses of several types, i.e. the production
of different kinds of symbols. In fact the universe of symbols is very rich: a
symbol can have a conceptual `value' (like in physics and then give rise to a
measurement), or other qualitative values (like in many human behaviors). In
the latter case, the Semiotic Interpretation of QM gives a way to understand
how a mental representation can modify the state of the body.

manipulating entanglement in multiparticle systems. We describe how this scheme
allows to establish multiparticle entanglement between particles belonging to
distant users in a communication network through a prior distribution of

We highlight the practical advantages of using a series of entanglement

information theory, computer science, and quantum physics. This review aims to
summarise not just quantum computing, but the whole subject of quantum
information theory. It turns out that information theory and quantum mechanics
fit together very well. In order to explain their relationship, the review
begins with an introduction to classical information theory and computer
science, including Shannon's theorem, error correcting codes, Turing machines
and computational complexity. The principles of quantum mechanics are then
outlined, and the EPR experiment described. The EPR-Bell correlations, and
quantum entanglement in general, form the essential new ingredient which
distinguishes quantum from classical information theory, and, arguably, quantum
from classical physics. Basic quantum information ideas are described,
including key distribution, teleportation, data compression, quantum error
correction, the universal quantum computer and quantum algorithms. The common
theme of all these ideas is the use of quantum entanglement as a computational
resource. Experimental methods for small quantum processors are briefly
sketched, concentrating on ion traps, high Q cavities, and NMR. The review
concludes with an outline of the main features of quantum information physics,
and avenues for future research.

finding that the simplest $[[n,1,d]]$ block codes can tolerate more noise with
smaller overheads than the $7^L$-bit concatenated code. The scaling is such
that block codes remain the better choice for all computations one is likely to

measurements of the system's state has been called the quantum Zeno effect (or
paradox). Here we investigate theoretically and numerically the effect of
repeated measurements on the quantum dynamics of the multilevel systems that
exhibit the quantum localization of the classical chaos. The analysis is based
on the wave function and Schroedinger equation, without introduction of the
density matrix. We show how the quantum Zeno effect in simple few-level systems
can be recovered and understood by formal modeling the measurement effect on
the dynamics by randomizing the phases of the measured states. Further the
similar analysis is extended to investigate of the dynamics of multilevel
systems driven by an intense external force and affected by frequent
measurement. We show that frequent measurements of such quantum systems results
in the delocalization of the quantum suppression of the classical chaos. This
result is the opposite of the quantum Zeno effect. The phenomenon of
delocalization of the quantum suppression and restoration of the classical-like
time evolution of these quasiclassical systems, owing to repetitive frequent
measurements, can therefore be called the 'quantum anti-Zeno effect'. From this
analysis we furthermore conclude that frequently or continuously observable
quasiclassical systems evolve basically in a classical manner.

of a quantum system requires choosing a framework or consistent family, and
then calculating probabilities for the different histories which it contains.
It is argued that the framework is chosen by the physicist constructing a
description of a quantum system on the basis of questions he wishes to address,
in a manner analogous to choosing a coarse graining of the phase space in
classical statistical mechanics. The choice of framework is not determined by
some law of nature, though it is limited by quantum incompatibility, a concept
which is discussed using a two-dimensional Hilbert space (spin half particle).
Thus certain questions of physical interest can only be addressed using
frameworks in which they make (quantum mechanical) sense. The physicist's
choice does not influence reality, nor does the presence of choices render the
theory subjective. On the contrary, predictions of the theory can, in
principle, be verified by experimental measurements. These considerations are
used to address various criticisms and possible misunderstandings of the
consistent history approach, including its predictive power, whether it
requires a new logic, whether it can be interpreted realistically, the nature
of ``quasiclassicality'', and the possibility of ``contrary'' inferences.

electrodynamics models of monopoles are able to explain the quantization of

magnetic photon. Its discovery by the predicted effect would have far-reaching

which may find applications in medicine. (ii) Evidence for symmetrized Maxwell
equations. (iii) Evidence for an absolute rest frame that gives rise to local

bath is studied. The register consists of $N$ qubits (i.e. spin ${1/2}$ degrees
of freedom), the bath is described by $N_b$ bosonic modes. The register-bath
coupling is chosen in such a way that the total number of excitations is
conserved. The Hilbert space splits allowing the study of the dynamics
separately in each sector. Assuming that the coupling with the bath is the same
for all qubits, the excitation sectors have a further decomposition according
the irreducible representations of the $su(2)$ spin algebra. The stability
against environment-generated noise of the information encoded in a quantum
state of the register depends on its $su(2)$ symmetry content. At zero
temperature we find that states belonging to the vacuum symmetry sector have
for long time vanishing fidelity, whereas each lowest spin vector is decoupled
from the bath and therefore is decoherence free. Numerical results are shown in
the one-excitation space in the case qubit-dependent bath-system coupling.

Liouville-von Neumann 1-particle dynamics to an arbitrary number of particles
is described. It is shown at a general level that the dynamics so obtained is
completely separable, which is the strongest condition one can impose on
dynamics of composite systems. It requires that for all initial states
(entangled or not) a subsystem not only cannot be influenced by any action
undertaken by an observer in a separated system (strong separability), but
additionally that the self-consistency condition $Tr_2\circ
\phi^t_{1+2}=\phi^t_{1}\circ Tr_2$ is fulfilled. It is shown that a correct
extension to $N$ particles involves integro-differential equations which, in
spite of their nonlocal appearance, make the theory fully local. As a
consequence a much larger class of nonlinearities satisfying the complete
separability condition is allowed than has been assumed so far. In particular
all nonlinearities of the form $F(|\psi(x)|)$ are acceptable. This shows that
the locality condition does not single out logarithmic or 1-homeogeneous
nonlinearities.

to construct a Hamiltonian $H$ according to Feynman's prescription. Differences
between these models and the models of Deutsch are discussed and reviewed. It
is emphasized that the models with $H$ constructed from $T$ include fully
quantum mechanical processes that take computation basis states into linear
superpositions of these states. The requirement that $T$ be distinct path
generating is reviewed. The advantage of this requirement is that
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger evolution under $H$ is one dimensional along distinct finite or
infinite paths of nonoverlapping states in some basis $B_{T}$. It is emphasized
that $B_{T}$ can be arbitrarily complex with extreme entanglements between
states of component systems. The new aspect of quantum Turing machines
introduced here is the emphasis on the structure of graphs obtained when the
states in the $B_{T}$ paths are expanded as linear superpositions of states in
a reference basis such as the computation basis $B_{C}$. Examples are discussed
that illustrate the main points of the paper. For one example the graph
structures of the paths in $B_{T}$ expanded as states in $B_{C}$ include finite
stage binary trees and concatenated finite stage binary trees with or without
terminal infinite binary trees. Other examples are discussed in which the graph
structures correspond to interferometers and iterations of interferometers.

the eigenenergies exhibit strong level repulsions when the angle between the

conventional perturbation theory. However, it is well reproduced by an extended

a quantum manifestation of classical intramanifold chaos. This interpretation

Hamiltonians are considered that commute with the system's Hamiltonian so that

that the decoherence process is controlled by spectral properties of the

only the radial modes. We solve explicitly the radial equations for the uniform
magnetic field inside a solenoid of a finite radius and consider in detail the
scattering of scalar and Dirac particles in this field. For particles with low

  Distributions</title><description>  We exploit results on the classical Stieltjes moment problem to obtain
completely explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for the photon number
distribution p(n) of a radiation field mode to be classical. These conditions
are given in two forms - respectively local and global in the individual photon
number probabilities. Central to the first approach is the recognition of the
important fact that the quantities n!p(n) are moments of a quasiprobability
distribution, notwithstanding the fact that p(n)'s can by themselves be
considered as a probability distribution over the nonnegative integers. This
leads to local classicality conditions involving p(n)'s for only a small number
of values of n. This local approach enables us to present detailed quantitative
statements on the connection between nonclassicality and oscillations in the
photon number distribution. The second approach is in terms of the traditional
factorial moments of p(n). Equivalence of the two approaches is established.

behavior, the prevailing view on the interpretation of quantum mechanics
appears to be gradually changing. A (highly unscientific) poll taken at the
1997 UMBC quantum mechanics workshop gave the once all-dominant Copenhagen
interpretation less than half of the votes. The Many Worlds interpretation
(MWI) scored second, comfortably ahead of the Consistent Histories and Bohm
interpretations. It is argued that since all the above-mentioned approaches to
nonrelativistic quantum mechanics give identical cookbook prescriptions for how
to calculate things in practice, practical-minded experimentalists, who have
traditionally adopted the ``shut-up-and-calculate interpretation'', typically
show little interest in whether cozy classical concepts are in fact real in
some untestable metaphysical sense or merely the way we subjectively perceive a
mathematically simpler world where the Schrodinger equation describes
everything - and that they are therefore becoming less bothered by a profusion
of worlds than by a profusion of words.
  Common objections to the MWI are discussed. It is argued that when
environment-induced decoherence is taken into account, the experimental
predictions of the MWI are identical to those of the Copenhagen interpretation
except for an experiment involving a Byzantine form of ``quantum suicide''.
This makes the choice between them purely a matter of taste, roughly equivalent
to whether one believes mathematical language or human language to be more
fundamental.

with the hypothesis that all experimental measurements consist of positional
measurements at different times, we characterize directly a class of nonlinear
quantum theories physically equivalent to linear quantum mechanics through
nonlinear gauge transformations. We show that under two physically-motivated
assumptions, these transformations are uniquely determined: they are exactly
the group of time-dependent, nonlinear gauge transformations introduced
previously for a family of nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger equations. The general
equation in this family, including terms considered by Kostin, by
Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski, and by Doebner and Goldin, with time-dependent
coefficients, can be obtained from the linear Schr\&quot;odinger equation through
gauge transformation and a subsequent process we call gauge generalization. We
thus unify, on fundamental grounds, a rather diverse set of nonlinear
time-evolutions in quantum mechanics.

we introduced a self-adjoint operator $\hat {{\cal T}}(X)$ whose eigenstates
can be used to define consistently a probability distribution of the time of
arrival at a given spatial point. In the present work we show that the
probability distribution previously proposed can be well understood on
classical grounds in the sense that it is given by the expectation value of a
certain positive definite operator $\hat J^{(+)}(X)$ which is nothing but a
straightforward quantum version of the modulus of the classical current. For
quantum states highly localized in momentum space about a certain momentum $p_0
\neq 0$, the expectation value of $\hat J^{(+)}(X)$ becomes indistinguishable
from the quantum probability current. This fact may provide a justification for
the common practice of using the latter quantity as a probability distribution

`operational' weak energy condition: the energy of an isolated device
constructed to measure or trap the energy in a region, plus the energy it
measures or traps, cannot be negative. There are good reasons for thinking that
similar results hold locally for linear quantum fields in curved space-times. A
thought experiment to measure energy density is analyzed in some detail, and
the operational positivity is clearly manifested.
  If operational energy conditions do hold for quantum fields, then the
negative energy densities predicted by theory have a will-o'-the-wisp
character: any local attempt to verify a total negative energy density will be
self-defeating on account of quantum measurement difficulties. Similarly,
attempts to drive exotic effects (wormholes, violations of the second law,
etc.) by such densities may be defeated by quantum measurement problems. As an
example, I show that certain attempts to violate the Cosmic Censorship
principle by negative energy densities are defeated.
  These quantum measurement limitations are investigated in some detail, and
are shown to indicate that space-time cannot be adequately modeled classically
in negative energy density regimes.

The Hamiltonian is
given by the Laplace -- Beltrami operator on the group manifold, and the
purpose is to get the (Feynman's) evolution kernel. The spectral expansion,
which produced a series of the representation characters for the evolution
kernel in the compact case, does not exist for non-compact group, where the
spectrum is not bounded. In this work real analytical groups are investigated,
some of which are of interest for physics. An integral representation for the
evolution operator is obtained in terms of the Green function, i.e. the
solution to the Helmholz equation on the group manifold. The alternative series
expressions for the evolution operator are reconstructed from the same integral
representation, the spectral expansion (when exists) and the sum over classical
paths. For non-compact groups, the latter can be interpreted as the (exact)
semi-classical approximation, like in the compact case. The explicit form of
the evolution operator is obtained for a number of non-compact groups.

the Lagrangian density for the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation is extended by terms
polynomial in $\Delta^{m}\ln (\Psi^{*}/{\Psi})$ multiplied by $\Psi^{*}{\Psi}$.
This introduces a homogeneous nonlinearity in a Galilean invariant manner
through the phase $S$ rather than the amplitude $R$ of the wave function $\Psi
=R\exp (iS)$. From this general scheme we choose the simplest minimal model
defined in some reasonable way. The model in question offers the simplest way
to modify the Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics so as to allow a leading
phase contribution to the quantum potential and a leading quantum contribution
to the probability current removing asymmetries present in Bohm's original
formulation. It preserves most of physically relevant properties of the
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation including stationary states of quantum-mechanical
systems. It can be thought of as the simplest model of nonlinear quantum
mechanics of extended objects among other such models that also emerge within
the general scheme proposed. The extensions of this model to $n$ particles and
the question of separability of compound systems are studied. It is noted that
there exists a weakly separable extension in addition to a strongly separable
one. The place of the general modification scheme in a broader spectrum of
nonlinear modifications of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation is discussed. It is
pointed out that the models it gives rise to have a unique definition of energy
in that the field-theoretical energy functional coincides with the
quantum-mechanical one. It is found that the Lagrangian for its simplest

analog of the conditional probability which has been introduced in
[quant-ph/9512022]. The spectrum of the conditional operator characterizing a
quantum bipartite system is invariant under local unitary transformations and
reflects its inseparability. More specifically, it is shown that the
conditional amplitude operator of a separable state cannot have an eigenvalue
exceeding 1, which results in a necessary condition for separability. This
leads us to consider a related separability criterion based on the positive map
$\Gamma:\rho \to (Tr \rho) - \rho$, where $\rho$ is an Hermitian operator. Any
separable state is mapped by the tensor product of this map and the identity
into a non-negative operator, which provides a simple necessary condition for
separability. In the special case where one subsystem is a quantum bit,
$\Gamma$ reduces to time-reversal, so that this separability condition is
equivalent to partial transposition. It is therefore also sufficient for
$2\times 2$ and $2\times 3$ systems. Finally, a simple connection between this
map and complex conjugation in the &quot;magic&quot; basis is displayed.

Furthermore, it is shown how classical constraints not in involution with the

gravity the anomaly is very complicated and the equations picking out physical

theory it is possible, given initial and final states, to construct two
different consistent families of histories, in each of which there is a
proposition that can be inferred with probability one, and such that the
projectors representing these two propositions are mutually orthogonal. In this
note we stress that, according to the rules of consistent history reasoning two
such propositions are not contrary in the usual logical sense namely, that one
can infer that if one is true then the other is false, and both could be false.
No single consistent family contains both propositions, together with the
initial and final states, and hence the propositions cannot be logically
compared. Consistent histories quantum theory is logically consistent,
consistent with experiment as far as is known, consistent with the usual

  \bar B^0 System</title><description>  Considering semileptonic decays of the entangled B^0 \bar B^0 state which is
generated in the decay of Upsilon(4S), we simply multiply the
quantum-mechanical interference term by a factor (1-\zeta) and use the
``decoherence parameter'' \zeta as a measure for deviations from quantum
mechanics. We investigate several consequences of this modification of
semileptonic B^0 \bar B^0 decays. In particular, we show that when confronted
with the experimental values of the ratio R=(# like-sign dilepton events)/(#
opposite-sign dilepton events) and of the B_H--B_L mass difference, the ensuing
one standard deviation range of the decoherence parameter depends strongly on
the basis in the B^0--\bar B^0 space used to build the entangled B^0 \bar B^0
state. On the other hand, in quantum mechanics physical quantities are, of
course, independent of such arbitrary basis choices.

described in terms of the associated de Broglie waves and classical wave
optics. However, for weakly bound and relatively large systems, such as the
He_2 dimer, this might no longer hold true due to the possibility of break-up
processes and finite-size effects. We therefore study the diffraction of weakly
bound two-particle systems. If the bar and slit widths of the grating are much
larger than the diameter of the two-particle system we recover the usual optics
results. For smaller widths, however, deviations therefrom occur. We find that
the location of possible diffraction peaks is indeed still governed by the
usual grating function from optics, but the peaks may have a lower intensity.
This is not unexpected when break-up processes are allowed. More unusually
though, diffraction peaks which would be absent for de Broglie waves may
reappear. The results are illustrated for diffraction of He_2.

hole mass $M$ might have a discrete spectrum. I review the physical arguments
for the expectation that black hole horizon area eigenvalues are uniformly
spaced, or equivalently, that the spacing between stationary black hole mass
levels behaves like 1/M. This sort of spectrum has also emerged in a variety of
formal approaches to black hole quantization by a number of workers (with some
notable exceptions). If true, this result indicates a distortion of the
semiclassical Hawking spectrum which could be observable even for macroscopic
black holes. Black hole entropy suggests that the mentioned mass levels should
be degenerate to the tune of an exponential in $M^2$, as first noted by
Mukhanov. This has implications for the statistics of the radiation. I also
discuss open questions: whether radiative decay will spread the levels beyond
recognition, whether extremal black holes can be described by this scheme, etc.
I then describe an elementary algebra for the relevant black hole observables,
an outcome of work by Mukhanov and myself, which reproduces the uniformly
spaced area spectrum.

between the spherical and cylindrical bases of the oscillator are calculated.
It is shown that the relevant coefficients are expressed through the

Limiting transitions to a free motion and flat space are considered in detail.
Elliptic bases of the oscillator are constructed in the form of expansion over

of the free energy, for a minimally coupled scalar field in a Schwarzschild
geometry at finite temperature. This gives us the zero-point energy density as
a function of the distance from the massive object generating the gravitational
field. The contribution to the zero-point energy due to the curvature is
extracted too, in this way arriving at a renormalised expression for the energy
density (the Casimir energy density). We use this to find an expression for
other physical quantities: internal energy, pressure and entropy. It turns out
that the disturbance of the surrounding vacuum generates entropy. For $\beta$
small the entropy is positive for $r&gt;2M$. We also find that the internal energy
can be negative outside the horizon pointing to the existence of bound states.
The total energy inside the horizon turns out to be finite but complex, the
imaginary part being interpreted as responsible for particle creation.

that a tree falling in a forest makes no sound unless there is a listener
present. In fact, this conclusion is far from obvious. Furthermore, if a
tunnelling particle is observed in the barrier region, it collapses to a state
in which it is no longer tunnelling. Does this imply that while tunnelling, the
particle can not have any physical effects? I argue that this is not the case,
and moreover, speculate that it may be possible for a particle to have effects
on two spacelike separate apparatuses simultaneously. I discuss the measurable
consequences of such a feat, and speculate about possible statistical tests
which could distinguish this view of quantum mechanics from a ``corpuscular''
one. Brief remarks are made about an experiment underway at Toronto to

  Mechanics</title><description>  Examination of the Einstein energy-momentum relationship suggests that simple
unbound forms of matter exist in a four-dimensional Euclidean space. Position,
momentum, velocity, and other vector quantities can be expressed as Euclidean
four-vectors, with the magnitude of the velocity vector having a constant
value, the speed of light. We see that charge may be simply a manifestation of
momentum in the new fourth direction, which implies that charge conservation is
a form of momentum conservation. The constancy of speed implies that all
elementary free particles can be described in the same manner as photons, by
means of a wave equation. The resulting wave mechanics (with a few small
assumptions) is simply the traditional form of quantum mechanics. If one begins
by assuming the wave nature of matter, it is shown that special relativistic
results follow simply. Thus we see evidence of a strong connection between
relativity and quantum mechanics. Comparisons between the theory presented here
and Kaluza-Klein theories reveal some similarities, but also many significant
differences between them.

Therefore it is valid only in the short time limit. Using a renormalization

particle in the electric field is believed to be a topological effect closely
related to the known Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. We study how it depends on the
spin of the particle involved. Duality of the AB and AC effects is demonstrated
to exist only for two extreme spin (and magnetic moment) projections.
  Classical consideration confirms the conclusion. Motion of a classical
magnetized particle with generally oriented magnetic moment in the AC field
appears to be subjected to both forces and torques. Only for two special
orientations of the magnetic moment (same as in the quantum case) the motion is
effectively free and similar to the AB motion of a charged particle. Thus, the
AC effect is not really topological.
  Presence of higher multipoles totally destroys the possible AB-AC duality.

remote parties, but it can reduce the communication needed for some problems.
Let each of k parties hold some partial input data to some fixed k-variable
function f. The communication complexity of f is the minimum number of
classical bits required to be broadcasted for every party to know the value of
f on their inputs.
  We construct a function G such that for the one-round communication model and
three parties, G can be computed with n+1 bits of communication when the
parties share prior entanglement. We then show that without entangled
particles, the one-round communication complexity of G is (3/2)n + 1. Next we
generalize this function to a function F. We show that if the parties share
prior quantum entanglement, then the communication complexity of F is exactly
k. We also show that if no entangled particles are provided, then the
communication complexity of F is roughly k*log(k).
  These two results prove for the first time communication complexity
separations better than a constant number of bits.

by interfering the field with an effectively classical local oscillator of
known phase. The standard technique is to have the local oscillator detuned
from the system (heterodyne detection) so that it is sometimes in phase and
sometimes in quadrature with the system over the course of the measurement.
This enables both quadratures of the system to be measured, from which the
phase can be estimated. One of us [H.M. Wiseman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4587
(1995)] has shown recently that it is possible to make a much better estimate
of the phase by using an adaptive technique in which a resonant local
oscillator has its phase adjusted by a feedback loop during the single-shot
measurement. In Ref.~[H.M. Wiseman and R.B. Killip, Phys. Rev. A 56, 944] we
presented a semiclassical analysis of a particular adaptive scheme, which
yielded asymptotic results for the phase variance of strong fields. In this
paper we present an exact quantum mechanical treatment. This is necessary for
calculating the phase variance for fields with small photon numbers, and also
for considering figures of merit other than the phase variance. Our results
show that an adaptive scheme is always superior to heterodyne detection as far
as the variance is concerned. However the tails of the probability distribution
are surprisingly high for this adaptive measurement, so that it does not always
result in a smaller probability of error in phase-based optical communication.

generation in the opposite direction by the oscillation of side walls. This can
be understood as the classical counterpart of the photon production. In the
case of two opposite walls oscillating with the same frequency but with a phase

dynamically induced phases of the atomic polarization in determining the
optimal phase matching conditions and angular distributions of harmonics. We
demonstrate that the phase matching and the spatial coherence can be controlled
by changing the focusing parameters of the fundamental laser beam. Then we
present a detailed study of the temporal and spectral properties of harmonics.
We discuss how the focusing conditions influence the individual harmonic
spectra and time profiles, and how the intensity dependence of the dynamically
induced phase leads to a chirp of the harmonic frequency. This phase modulation
can be used to control the temporal and spectral properties of the harmonic
radiation. Temporally, the harmonic chirped pulse can be recompressed to very
small durations. Spectrally, chirping of the fundamental beam may be employed
to compensate for the dynamically induced chirp and to control the individual
harmonic spectrum. Finally, we discuss the short pulse effects, in particular
nonadiabatic phenomena and the possibility of generating attosecond pulses.

Furthermore, we find the map reducing any system to the free one with vanishing

energy. These are uncertainty principle-type restrictions on the magnitude and
duration of negative energy densities or fluxes. We consider several examples
of apparent failures of the quantum inequalities, which involve passage of an
observer through regions where the negative energy density becomes singular. We
argue that this type of situation requires one to formulate quantum
inequalities using sampling functions with compact support. We discuss such
inequalities, and argue that they remain valid even in the presence of singular
energy densities.

quantum theory, some subset of 'beables' that can be consistently ascribed
determinate values. Moreover, this subset should be selected so as to guarantee
(among other things) that we can dispense with the orthodox interpretation's
loose talk about 'measurement values': &quot;...the probability of a beable being a
particular value would be calculated just as was formerly calculated the
probability of observing that value&quot;. Working in the framework of C*-algebras
(in particular, Segal algebras), I propose an algebraic characterization of
those subsets of bounded observables of a quantum system that can have beable
status with respect to any (fixed) state of the system. It turns out that
observables with beable status in a state need not all commute (a possibility
Bell himself does not consider), but they must at least form a certain kind of
'quasicommutative' subalgebra determined by the state. A virtue of the analysis
is that it applies to beables with continuous spectra, usually neglected in
discussions of the no-hidden-variables theorems. In the (very) special case
where the algebra of observables for a system is representable on a
finite-dimensional Hilbert space, I give a complete characterization of the
maximal beable subalgebras determined by any state of the system; the
infinite-dimensional case remains open. These results are discussed in relation
to previous results of a similar nature, to 'no-collapse' interpretations of
quantum mechanics, and to algebraic relativistic quantum field theory.

  coherent rotation and vortices</title><description>  We study the creation of vortex states in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate
by a rotating force. For a harmonic trapping potential the rotating force
induces only a circular motion of the whole condensate around the trap center
which does not depend on the interatomic interaction. For the creation of a
pure vortex state it is necessary to confine the atoms in an anharmonic
trapping potential. The efficiency of the creation can be greatly enhanced by a
sinusodial variation of the force's angular velocity. We present analytical and
numerical calculations for the case of a quartic trapping potential. The
physical mechanism behind the requirement of an anharmonic trapping potential
for the creation of pure vortex states is explained.

  Densities-of-States for Thermodynamic Purposes. I</title><description>  Among the monotone metrics on the (n^{2} - 1)-dimensional convex set of n x n
density matrices, as Petz and Sudar have recently elaborated, there are a
minimal (Bures) and a maximal one. We examine the proposition that it is
physically meaningful to treat the volume elements of these metrics as
densities-of-states for thermodynamic purposes. In the n = 2 (spin-1/2) case,
use of the maximal monotone metric, in fact, does lead to the adoption of the
Langevin (and not the Brillouin) functions, thus, completely conforming with a
recent probabilistic argument of Lavenda. Brody and Hughston also arrived at
the Langevin function in an analysis based on the Fubini-Study metric. It is a
matter of some interest, however, that in the first (subsequently modified)
version of their paper, they had reported a different result, one fully
consistent with the alternative use of the minimal monotone metric. In this
part I of our investigation, we first study scenarios involving partially
entangled spin-1/2 particles (n = 4, 6,...) and then a certain three-level
extension of the two-level systems. In part II, we examine, in full generality,
and with some limited analytical success, the cases n = 3 and 4.

of light. The wave function consists of a broad frequency forerunner generated
by the onset of the source, and of a monochromatic front which carries the
oscillation frequency of the source. For a medium with Schr\&quot;{o}dinger-like
dispersion the monochromatic front propagates with a velocity which is in
agreement with the traversal time, and in the relativistic case the velocity of
the fronts is limited by the velocity of light. For sources with a sharp onset,
the forerunners are not attenuated and in magnitude far exceed the
monochromatic front. In contrast, for sources which are frequency-band limited,
the forerunners are also attenuated and become comparable to the monochromatic
front: like in the propagating case, there exists a time at which a broad
frequency forerunner is augmented by a monochromatic wave.

Equivalently they are the set of normalized eigenstates (for all possible

leads to a three term recursion relation for the expansion coefficients, which
can be explicitly solved in the cases k = 1, 2. The solutions are essentially
Hermite and Pollaczek polynomials, respectively. k = 1 gives the ordinary
squeezed states, i.e. displaced squeezed vacua. For k equal to or larger than
three, where no explicit solution has been found, the recursion relation for
the symmetric operator given by the real part of the k:th power of the
annihilation operator defines a Jacobi matrix corresponding to a classical
Hamburger moment problem, which is undetermined. This implies that the operator
has an infinity of self-adjoint extensions, all with disjoint discrete spectra.
The corresponding squeezed states are well-defined, however.

of projection operators that represent propositions about time average of the

an operator corresponding to velocity that is quite distinct from the momentum

straightforward. We show that entanglement, in the Wigner representation, is
just a correlation that involves both signal and vacuum fluctuations. An
analysis of the detection process opens the way to a complete description of
parametric down conversion in terms of pure Maxwell electromagnetic waves.

interconnected in some standard way (e.g. by a mechanical transmission). We
explore the possibility of porting reductionism in quantum operations.
Conceptually, first parts are made independent of each other by assuming that
all ``transmissions'' are removed. The overall state would thus become a
superposition of tensor products of the eigenstates of the independent parts.
Transmissions are restored by projecting off all the tensor products which
violate them. This would be performed by particle statistics; the plausibility
of this scheme is based on the interpretation of particle statistics as
projection. The problem of the satisfiability of a Boolean network is
approached in this way. This form of quantum reductionism appears to be able of
taming the quantum whole without clipping its richness.

atomic transitions, and in parametric down conversion by nonlinear optical
crystals, may be represented by positive Wigner densities of the relevant sets
of mode amplitudes. The light fields of all such states are represented as a
real probability ensemble (not a pseudoensemble) of solutions of the
unquantized Maxwell equation.
  The local realist analysis of light-detection events in spatially separated
detectors requires a theory of detection which goes beyond the currently
fashionable single-mode photon theory. It also requires us to recognize that
there is a payoff between detector efficiency and signal-noise discrimination.
Using such a theory, we have demonstrated that all experimental data, both in
atomic cascades and in parametric down conversions, have a consistent local
realist explanation based on the unquantized Maxwell field.
  Finally we discuss current attempts to demonstrate Schroedinger-cat-like
behaviour of microwave cavities interacting with Rydberg atoms. Here also we
demonstrate that there is no experimental evidence which cannot be described by
the unquantized Maxwell field.
  We conclude that misuse of the Photon Concept has resulted in a mistaken
recognition of &quot;nonlocal&quot; phenomena.

proposed a quantum stochastic Schrodinger equation linked to dilations of
quantum dynamical semigroups. Such an equation has found applications in
physics, mainly in quantum optics, but not in its full generality. It has been
used to give, at least approximately, the dynamics of photoemissive sources
such as an atom absorbing and emitting light or matter in an optical cavity,
which exchanges light with the surrounding free space. But in these cases the
possibility of introducing the gauge (or number) process in the dynamical
equation has not been considered. In this paper we show, in the case of the
simplest photoemissive source, namely a two-level atom stimulated by a laser,
how the full Hudson-Parthasarathy equation allows to describe in a consistent
way not only absorption and emission, but also the elastic scattering of the
light by the atom. Morever, we study the differential and total cross sections
for the scattering of laser light by the atom, as a function of the frequency
of the stimulating laser. The resulting line-shape is very interesting. Not
only a Lorentzian shape is permitted, but the full variety of Fano profiles can
be obtained. The dependence of the line shape on the intensity of the
stimulating laser is computed; in particular, the resonance position turns out
to be intensity dependent, a phenomenon known as lamp shift.

  dislocations</title><description>  The motion of a conducting electron in a quantum dot with one or several
dislocations in the underlying crystal lattice is considered in the continuum
picture, where dislocations are represented by torsion of space. The possible
effects of torsion are investigated on the levels of classical motion,
non-relativistic quantum motion, and spin-torsion coupling terms derivable in
the non-relativistic limit of generalizations of the Dirac equation in a space
with torsion. Finally, phenomenological spin-torsion couplings analogous to
Pauli terms are considered in the non-relativistic equations. Different
prescriptions of classical and non-relativistic quantum motion in a space with
torsion are shown to give effects that should in principle be observable.
Semi-classical arguments are presented to show that torsion is not relevant for
the classical motion of the center of a wave packet. The correct semi-classical
limit can instead be described as classical trajectories in a Hamiltonian given
by the band energy. In the special case of a spherically symmetric band this
motion reduces to straight lines, independently of local crystal orientations.
By dimensional analysis the coupling constants of the possible spin-torsion
interactions are postulated to be proportional to a combination of the
effective mass of the electron, the lattice constant and $\hbar$. The
level-splitting is then very small with transition frequencies on the order of
1 kHz or smaller.

E(t,x) at different times t. For rational t, E(t,x) is a weighted sum of
delta-functions, and, therefore, exhibits the same regularity as at t=0. For
irrational t, the regularity of E(t,x) is better and depends on how well t is
approximated by rationals. For badly approximated t (e.g., when t is a
quadratic irrational, or, more generally, when t has bounded quotients in its
continued fraction expansion), E(t,x) is a &quot;1/2-derivative&quot; more regular than
E(0,x). For a generic irrational t, E(t,x) is almost &quot;1/2-derivative&quot; more
regular. However, the better t is approximated by rationals, the lower is the
regularity of E(t,x). We describe different thin classes of irrationals which
prescribe their particular regularity to the fundamental solution. These

fraction expansions of their members.

for bit commitment. However, we, and independently Mayers, showed that all
proposed quantum bit commitment schemes are, in principle, insecure because the
sender, Alice, can almost always cheat successfully by using an
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type of attack and delaying her measurements. One
might wonder if secure quantum bit commitment protocols exist at all. We answer
this question by showing that the same type of attack by Alice will, in
principle, break any bit commitment scheme. The cheating strategy generally
requires a quantum computer. We emphasize the generality of this ``no-go
theorem'': Unconditionally secure bit commitment schemes based on quantum
mechanics---fully quantum, classical or quantum but with measurements---are all
ruled out by this result. Since bit commitment is a useful primitive for
building up more sophisticated protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs, our
results cast very serious doubt on the security of quantum cryptography in the
so-called ``post-cold-war'' applications. We also show that ideal quantum coin
tossing is impossible because of the EPR attack. This no-go theorem for ideal
quantum coin tossing may help to shed some lights on the possibility of
non-ideal protocols.

Schr\&quot;odinger cat states. Macroscopic superpositions of 2^{n-1} sp(N,R) CS (2^n
canonical CS, n=1,2,...) are pointed out which are overcomplete in the N-mode
Hilbert space and the relation between the canonical CS and the u(p,q) BG-type
CS representations is established. The sets of u(p,q) and sp(N,R) BG CS and
their discrete superpositions contain many states studied in quantum optics
(even and odd N-mode CS, pair CS) and provide an approach to quadrature
squeezing, alternative to that of intelligent states. New subsets of weakly and
strongly nonclassical states are pointed out and their statistical properties
(first- and second-order squeezing, photon number distributions) are discussed.
For specific values of the angle parameters and small amplitude of the
canonical CS components these states approaches multimode Fock states with one,
two or three bosons/photons. It is shown that eigenstates of a squared

The
channel based on direct detection of number states, which for a lossless
transmission line would achieve the ultimate quantum channel capacity, is
easily degraded by loss. The same holds true for the channel based on homodyne
detection of squeezed states, which also is very fragile to loss. On the
contrary, the ``classical'' channel based on heterodyne detection of coherent
states is loss-invariant. We optimize the a priori probability for the
squeezed-state and the number-state channels, taking the effect of loss into
account. In the low power regime we achieve a sizeable improvement of the
mutual information, and both the squeezed-state and the number-state channels
overcome the capacity of the coherent-state channel. In particular, the
squeezed-state channel beats the classical channel for total average number of
photons $N&lt;8$. However, for sufficiently high power the classical channel
always performs as the best one. For the number-state channel we show that with
a loss $\eta\lesssim .6$ the optimized a priori probability departs from the
usual thermal-like behavior, and develops gaps of zero probability, with a
considerable improvement of the mutual information (up to 70 % of improvement
at low power for attenuation $\eta=.15$).

discovery of a quantum algorithm which can factor large numbers in polynomial
time. The usefulness of a quantum com puter is limited by the effect of errors.
Simulation is a useful tool for determining the feasibility of quantum
computers in the presence of errors. The size of a quantum computer that can be
simulat ed is small because faithfully modeling a quantum computer requires an
exponential amount of storage and number of operations. In this paper we define
simulation models to study the feasibility of quantum computers. The most
detailed of these models is based directly on a proposed imple mentation. We
also define less detailed models which are exponentially less complex but still
pro duce accurate results. Finally we show that the two different types of
errors, decoherence and inaccuracies, are uncorrelated. This decreases the
number of simulations which must be per formed.

apply the quantum singular time dependent oscillator model to describe the

that the relative motion of the ions, in contradistinction to its center of

systems. Here, we investigate the connection between the spectral properties of
the quantum-mechanical scattering matrix and its semiclassical equivalent based
on the semiclassical zeta-function of Gutzwiller and Voros. Our
quantum-mechanical calculation is well-defined at every step, as the on-shell
T-matrix and the multiscattering kernel M-1 are shown to be trace-class. The
multiscattering determinant can be organized in terms of the cumulant expansion
which is the defining prescription for the determinant over an infinite, but
trace-class matrix. The quantum cumulants are then expanded by traces which, in
turn, split into quantum itineraries or cycles. These can be organized by a
simple symbolic dynamics. The semiclassical reduction of the coherent
multiscattering part takes place on the level of the quantum cycles. We show
that the semiclassical analog of the m-th quantum cumulant is the m-th
curvature term of the semiclassical zeta function. In this way quantum
mechanics naturally imposes the curvature regularization structured by the
topological (not the geometrical) length of the pertinent periodic orbits onto
the semiclassical zeta function. However, since the cumulant limit m-&gt;infinity
and the semiclassical limit hbar-&gt;0 do not commute in general, the
semiclassical analog of the quantum multiscattering determinant is a curvature
expanded, truncated semiclassical zeta function. We relate the order of this
truncation to the topological entropy of the corresponding classical system.

ensemble of mixed states. We prove that for arbitrary coding schemes the least
number of qubits needed to convey the signal states asymptotically faithfully
is bounded from below by the Holevo function
$S(\varrho)-\sum_ip_iS(\varrho_i)$. We also show that a compression protocol
can be composed with another one, provided that the latter offers perfect
transmission. Such a compound protocol is applied to the case of binary source.
It is conjectured to reach the obtained bound. Finally, we point out that in
the case of mixed signal states there could be a difference between the maximal
compression rates at the coding schemes which are ``blind'' to the signal and
the ones which assume the knowledge about the identities of the signal states.

rely upon the notion of a system evolving in a superposition of quantum states

  Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  Intrinsic microphysical irreversibility is the time asymmetry observed in
exponentially decaying states. It is described by the semigroup generated by
the Hamiltonian $\QTR{it}{H}$ of the quantum physical system, not by the
semigroup generated by a Liouvillian $\QTR{it}{L}$ which describes the
irreversibility due to the influence of an external reservoir or measurement
apparatus. The semigroup time evolution generated by $\QTR{it}{H}$ is
impossible in the Hilbert Space (HS) theory, which allows only time symmetric
boundary conditions and an unitary group time evolution. This leads to problems
with decay probabilities in the HS theory. To overcome these and other problems
(non-existence of Dirac kets) caused by the Lebesgue integrals of the HS, one
extends the HS to a Gel'fand triplet, which contains not only Dirac kets, but
also generalized eigenvectors of the self-adjoint $\QTR{it}{H}$ with complex
eigenvalues ($E_R-i\Gamma /2$) and a Breit-Wigner energy distribution. These
Gamow states $\psi ^G$ have a time asymmetric exponential evolution. One can
derive the decay probability of the Gamow state into the decay products
described by $\Lambda $ from the basic formula of quantum mechanics
$\QTR{cal}{P}(t)=Tr(|\psi ^G&gt; &lt; \psi ^G|\Lambda)$, which in HS quantum
mechanics is identically zero. From this result one derives the decay rate
$\QTR{group}{\dot c}(t)$ and all the standard relations between
$\QTR{group}{\dot c}(0)$, $\Gamma $ and the lifetime $\tau_R$ used in the
phenomenology of resonance scattering and decay. In the Born approximation one
obtains Dirac's Golden Rule.

Then this technique is used to clarify the physical nature of thermal effects
as seen by an accelerated observer in Minkowski space-time (Unruh effect) and
by a far observer in the field of a black hole (Hawking effect). The physical
nature of the &quot;thermal atmosphere&quot; around the observer is analysed in three
cases: a) the Unruh effect, b) an eternal (Kruskal) black hole and c) a black
hole forming in the process of collapse. It is shown that thermal particles are
real only in the case (c). In the case (b) they cannot be distinguished from
real particles but they do not carry away mass of the black hole until some of
these particles are absorbed by the far observer. In the case (a) thermal
particles are virtual.

distinguishability for quantum-mechanical states. This is done from the point
of view of the cryptographer with a particular eye on applications in quantum
cryptography. Each of the measures considered is rooted in an analogous
classical measure of distinguishability for probability distributions: namely,
the probability of an identification error, the Kolmogorov distance, the
Bhattacharyya coefficient, and the Shannon distinguishability (as defined
through mutual information). These measures have a long history of use in
statistical pattern recognition and classical cryptography. We obtain several
inequalities that relate the quantum distinguishability measures to each other,
one of which may be crucial for proving the security of quantum cryptographic
key distribution. In another vein, these measures and their connecting
inequalities are used to define a single notion of cryptographic exponential
indistinguishability for two families of quantum states. This is a tool that
may prove useful in the analysis of various quantum cryptographic protocols.

with the quantum system under observation, and then it must be given a
classical description so that the result of the measurement appears as
objective reality. Alternatively, the apparatus may always be treated by
quantum mechanics, and be measured by a second apparatus which has such a dual
description. This article examines whether these two different descriptions are
mutually consistent. It is shown that if the dynamical variable used in the
first apparatus is represented by an operator of the Weyl-Wigner type (for
example, if it is a linear coordinate), then the conversion from quantum to
classical terminology does not affect the final result. However, if the first
apparatus encodes the measurement in a different type of operator (e.g., the
phase operator), the two methods of calculation may give different results.

protected from errors that arise due to uncontrolled interactions with the

Recovery from errors can work effectively even if occasional mistakes occur
during the recovery procedure. Furthermore, encoded quantum information can be
processed without serious propagation of errors. In principle, an arbitrarily
long quantum computation can be performed reliably, provided that the average
probability of error per gate is less than a certain critical value, the
accuracy threshold. It may be possible to incorporate intrinsic fault tolerance
into the design of quantum computing hardware, perhaps by invoking topological
Aharonov-Bohm interactions to process quantum information.

The overall state would thus become a superposition of tensor products of the

off all the tensor products which violate them. This would be performed by
