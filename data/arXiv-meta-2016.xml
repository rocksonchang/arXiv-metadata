anyone's knowledge of its properties. The important question is not what
quantum states represent but how they are used---as informational bridges.
Knowing about some physical situations (its backing conditions), an agent may
assign a quantum state to form expectations about other possible physical
situations (its advice conditions). Quantum states are objective: only
expectations based on correct state assignments are generally reliable. If a
quantum state represents anything, it is the objective probabilistic relations
between its backing conditions and its advice conditions. This paper offers an
account of quantum states and their function as informational bridges, in
quantum teleportation and elsewhere.

refined and reformulated his views on locality and causality. Although his
formulations of local causality were in terms of probability, he had little to
say about that notion. But assumptions about probability are implicit in his
arguments and conclusions. Probability does not conform to these assumptions
when quantum mechanics is applied to account for the particular correlations
Bell argues are locally inexplicable. This account involves no superluminal
action and there is even a sense in which it is local, but it is in tension
with the requirement that the direct causes and effects of events are nearby.

projective measurements by the steering party. In the simplest nontrivial
scenario of two projective measurements, we solve this problem completely by
virtue of the connection between the steering problem and the joint-measurement
problem. A necessary and sufficient criterion is derived together with a simple
geometrical interpretation. Our study shows that a Bell-diagonal state is
steerable by two projective measurements iff it violates the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, in sharp contrast with the strict
hierarchy expected between steering and Bell nonlocality. We also introduce a
steering measure and clarify its connections with concurrence and the volume of
the steering ellipsoid. In particular, we determine the maximal concurrence and
ellipsoid volume of Bell-diagonal states that are not steerable by two
projective measurements. Finally, we explore the steerability of Bell-diagonal
states under three projective measurements. A simple sufficient criterion is
derived, which can detect the steerability of many states that are not
steerable by two projective measurements. Our study offers valuable insight on
steering of Bell-diagonal states as well as the connections between
entanglement, steering, and Bell nonlocality.

optical experiments to the chip-scale, allowing for demonstrations of
large-scale quantum information processing and quantum simulation. However,
despite these advances, practical implementations of quantum photonic circuits
remain limited because they consist of large networks of waveguide
interferometers that path encode information which do not easily scale.
Increasing the dimensionality of current quantum systems using higher degrees
of freedom such as transverse spatial field distribution, polarization, time,
and frequency to encode more information per carrier will enable scalability by
simplifying quantum computational architectures, increasing security and noise
tolerance in quantum communication channels, and simulating richer quantum
phenomena. Here we demonstrate a scalable platform for photonic quantum
information processing using waveguide quantum circuit building blocks based on
the transverse spatial mode degree of freedom: mode multiplexers and mode
beamsplitters. A multimode waveguide is inherently a densely packed system of
spatial and polarization modes that can be coupled by perturbations to the
waveguide. We design a multimode waveguide consisting of three spatial modes
(per polarization) and a nanoscale grating beamsplitter to show tunable quantum
interference between pairs of photons in different transverse spatial modes. We
also cascade these structures and demonstrate NOON state interferometry within
a multimode waveguide. These devices have potential to perform transformations
on more modes and be integrated with existing architectures, providing a
scalable path to higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces and entanglement.

particular the evolution time of a system cannot be arbitrarily fast. Bounds on
the speed of evolution for unitary dynamics have been long studied. A few
bounds on the speed of evolution for noisy dynamics have also been obtained
recently, these bounds, however, are in general not tight. In this article we
present a new framework for quantum speed limit of noisy dynamics. With this
framework we obtain the exact maximal angle that a noisy dynamics can achieve
at any given time, this then provides tight bounds on the evolution time for
noisy dynamics. The obtained bound reveals that noisy dynamics are generically
different from unitary dynamics, in particular we show that the
'orthogonalization' time, which is the minimum time needed to evolve any state
to its orthogonal states, is in general not applicable to noisy dynamics.

  graphene-nanomechanical system</title><description>  We optomechanically measure the vibrations of a nanomechanical system made of
a graphene membrane suspended on a silicon nitride nanoresonator. When probing
the thermal noise of the coupled nanomechanical device, we observe a
significant deviation from the normal mode expansion. It originates from the
heterogeneous character of mechanical dissipation over the spatial extension of
coupled eigenmodes, which violates one of the fundamental prerequisite for
employing this commonly used description of the nanoresonators' thermal noise.
We subsequently measure the local mechanical susceptibility and demonstrate
that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem still holds and permits a proper
evaluation of the thermal noise of the nanomechanical system. Since it
naturally becomes delicate to ensure a good spatial homogeneity at the
nanoscale, this approach is fundamental to correctly describe the thermal noise
of nanomechanical systems which ultimately impact their sensing capacity.

far-off-resonant Raman absorption in ensembles of $\Lambda$-type atoms. However
at room temperature these systems exhibit unwanted four-wave mixing, which is
prohibitive for applications at the single-photon level. Here we show how this

optical cavity, thereby removing the main roadblock hindering this approach to
quantum memory.

measuring mechanical pressure in manufacturing to detecting protein
concentration in biomedical samples. A variety of sensing approaches exist, and
plasmonic systems in particular have received much attention due to their
ability to confine light below the diffraction limit, greatly enhancing
sensitivity. Recently, quantum techniques have been identified that can
outperform classical sensing methods and achieve sensitivity below the
so-called shot-noise limit. Despite this significant potential, the use of
definite photon number states in lossy plasmonic systems for further improving
sensing capabilities is not well studied. Here, we investigate the sensing
performance of a plasmonic interferometer that simultaneously exploits the
quantum nature of light and its electromagnetic field confinement. We show
that, despite the presence of loss, specialised quantum resources can provide
improved sensitivity and resolution beyond the shot-noise limit within a
compact plasmonic device operating below the diffraction limit.

  Environment</title><description>  We study on the tripartite entanglement dynamics when each party is initially
entangled with other parties, but they locally interact with their own
non-Markovian environment. First, we consider three GHZ-type initial states,
all of which have GHZ symmetry provided that the parameters are chosen
appropriately. However, this symmetry is broken due to the effect of
environment. The corresponding $\pi$-tangles, one of the tripartite
entanglement measure, are analytically computed at arbitrary time. The revival
phenomenon of entanglement occurs after complete disappearance of entanglement.
We also consider two W-type initial states. The revival phenomenon also occurs
in this case. On the analytical ground the robustness issue against the effect
of environment is examined for both GHZ-type and W-type initial states.

  Bell-type tests using generalized phase-space distributions</title><description>  We present Bell-type tests of nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity for
single-mode fields employing a generalized quasiprobability function. Our
nonclassicality tests are based on the observation that two orthogonal
quadratures in phase space (position and momentum) behave as independent
realistic variables for a coherent state. Taking four (three) points at the
vertices of a rectangle (right triangle) in phase space, our tests detect every
pure nonclassical Gaussian state and a range of mixed Gaussian states. These
tests also set an upper bound for all Gaussian states and their mixtures, which
thereby provide criteria for genuine quantum non-Gaussianity. We optimize the
non-Gaussianity tests by employing a squeezing transformation in phase space
that converts a rectangle (right triangle) to a parallelogram (triangle), which
enlarges the set of non-Gaussian states detectable in our formulation. We
address fundamental and practical limits of our generalized phase-space tests
by looking into their relation with decoherence under a lossy Gaussian channel
and their robustness against finite data and nonoptimal choice of phase-space
points. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our parallelogram test can identify
useful resources for nonlocality testing in phase space.

localization regime). We prove that for any dimension d the expectation of
entanglement entropy of the cubic block of side length L divided by the surface
area of the block has a finite limit as L tends to infinity and we identify the

results by Pastur L., Slavin V., Phys. Rev. Lett. 113 (2014) 150404, the

process as a rotation on the Bloch sphere for a pseudo-spin-1/2 system. The
spin state of a spin-1/2 quantum system can be described by a point on the

pulse area, the relative intensities and phases, and the relative frequencies.
We experimentally demonstrate key features of this model with a $^{87}$Rb

geometric interpretation, we use the Raman process to create and tailor as well

  with ultracold atoms in an optical lattice</title><description>  Since the well-known PT symmetry has its fundamental significance and
implication in physics, where PT denotes the combined operation of
space-inversion P and time-reversal T, it is extremely important and intriguing
to completely classify exotic PT-invariant topological metals and to physically
realize them. Here we, for the first time, establish a rigorous classification
of topological metals that are protected by the PT symmetry using KO-theory. As
a physically realistic example, a PT-invariant nodal loop (NL) model in a 3D
Brillouin zone is constructed, whose topological stability is revealed through
its PT-symmetry-protected nontrivial Z2 topological charge. Based on these
exact results, we propose an experimental scheme to realize and to detect
tunable PT-invariant topological NL states with ultracold atoms in an optical
lattice, in which atoms with two hyperfine spin states are loaded in a
spin-dependent 3D OL and two pairs of Raman lasers are used to create
out-of-plane spin-flip hopping with site-dependent phase. Such a realistic
cold-atom setup can yield topological NL states, having a tunable ring-shaped
band-touching line with the two-fold degeneracy in the bulk spectrum and
non-trivial surface states. The states are actually protected by the combined
PT symmetry even in the absence of both P and T symmetries, and are
characterized by a Z2-type invariant (a quantized Berry phase). Remarkably, we
demonstrate with numerical simulations that (i) the characteristic NL can be
detected by measuring the atomic transfer fractions in a Bloch-Zener
oscillation; (ii) the topological invariant may be measured based on the
time-of-flight imaging; and (iii) the surface states may be probed through
Bragg spectroscopy. The present proposal for realizing topological NL states in
cold atom systems may provide a unique experimental platform for exploring
exotic PT-invariant topological physics.

  delayed-choice experiments</title><description>  Many delayed-choice experiments based on Mach-Zehnder interferometers (MZI)
have been thought and made to address the fundamental problem of wave-particle
duality. Conventional wisdoms long hold that by inserting or removing the
second beam splitter (BS2) in a controllable way, microscopic particles
(photons, electrons, etc.) transporting within the MZI can lie in the quantum
superposition of the wave and particle state as
\psi=a_w\psi_wave+a_p\psi_particle. Here we present an alternative
interpretation to these delayed-choice experiments. We notice that as all
composite devices of MZI including BS2 are purely classical, the inserting and
removing operation of BS2 imposes a time-modulated Hamiltonian
H_mod(t)=a(t)H_in+b(t)H_out, instead of a quantum superposition of H_in and
H_out as H=a_wH_in+b_pH_out, to act upon the incident wave function. Solution
of this quantum scattering problem, rather than the long held quantum
eigen-problem yields a synchronically time-modulated output wave function as
\psi_mod=a(t)\psi_wave+b(t)\psi_particle. As a result, the probability of
particle output from the MZI behaves as if they are in the superposition of the
wave and particle state when many events over time accumulation are counted and
averaged. We expect these elementary but insightful analyses will shed a new
light on exploring basic physics beyond the long-held wisdom of wave-particle
duality and principle of complementarity.

of quantum superposition compete with classical dynamics of optical pumping and
atomic diffusion? Is it optical pumping that first prepares a thermal ensemble,
with coherent superposition developing subsequently or is it the other way
round: coherently superposed atoms driven to steady state via optical pumping?
Using a stroboscopic probing technique, here we experimentally explore these
questions. A 100 ns pulse is used to probe an experimentally simulated, closed
three-level, lambda-like configuration in rubidium atoms, driven by strong
coherent control and incoherent fields. Temporal evolution of probe
transmission shows an initial overshoot with turn-on of control, resulting in a
scenario akin to lasing without inversion (LWI). The corresponding rise time is
dictated by coherent dynamics, with a distinct experimental signature of
half-cycle Rabi flop in a thermal ensemble of atoms. Our results indicate that,
in fact, optical pumping drives the atoms to a steady state in a significantly
longer time-scale that sustains superposed dark states. Eventual control
turn-off leads to a sudden fall in transmission with an ubiquitous signature
for identifying closed and open systems. Numerical simulations and toy-model
predictions confirm our claims. These studies reveal new insights into a rich

  conformal field theory</title><description>  Matrix product states (MPS) illustrate the suitability of tensor networks for
the description of interacting many-body systems: ground states of gapped $1$-D
systems are approximable by MPS as shown by Hastings [J. Stat. Mech. Theor.
Exp., P08024 (2007)]. In contrast, whether MPS and more general tensor networks
can accurately reproduce correlations in critical quantum systems, respectively
quantum field theories, has not been established rigorously. Ample evidence
exists: entropic considerations provide restrictions on the form of suitable

  from Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  We construct a macroscopic thermodynamical theory that satisfies the second
law of thermodynamics, based on quantum mechanics. More concretely, our
macroscopic theory satisfies the following two features: (1) A macroscopic
equilibrium state is expressed as a set of macroscopic variables
$\vec{a}=(a_1,\cdots,a_L)$, which represents coarse-grained values of a set of
physical quantities, and (2) An adiabatic transformation from an equilibrium
state $\vec{a}$ to another state $\vec{a}'$ is possible if and only if
$s_{\vec{a}}\le s_{\vec{a}'}$ holds. Here, $s_{\vec{a}}$ is a real-valued
function corresponding to the thermodynamical entropy, which depends only on
macroscopic variables $\vec{a}$. We show that such a macroscopic
thermodynamical theory can be consistently constructed if the von-Neumann
entropy of a generalized microcanonical state satisfies a generalized central
limit theorem. We also show that even when the von-Neumann entropies do not
satisfy the condition, a macroscopic thermodynamic-like theory with a similar
structure exists, which could be at the foundations of nonequilibrium
thermodynamics. Finally, we make a replica of $(U,V,N)$ expression of
thermodynamics satisfying (1) and (2), using a toy model of free particles in a
box.

the second one the coherent evolution is completely suppressed and the

ergodicity and mixing using the structure of the system's energy levels and
spacings. Our definitions are consistent with usual understanding of ergodicity
and mixing. Two parameters concerning the degeneracy in energy levels and
spacings are introduced; their relations to quantum ergodicity and mixing are
demonstrated with right triangular billiards. With this billiard system, we
find that a system is ergodic in its quantum dynamics may not be ergodic in its
classical dynamics. At the end, we argue that, besides ergodicity and mixing,
there may exist a third class of quantum dynamics which is characterized by a
maximized entropy.

interaction in the context of high impedance waveguides, focusing on the
behavior of the emitted photonic states, in the framework of the spin-boson
model Quantum quenches as well as scattering of an incident coherent pulse are
studied using two complementary methods. First, we develop an approximate
ansatz for the electromagnetic waves based on a single multimode coherent state
wavefunction; formally, this approach combines ideas from adiabatic
renormalization, the Born-Markov approximation, and input-output theory.
Second, we present numerically exact results for scattering of a weak intensity
pulse by using NRG calculations. NRG provides a benchmark for any linear
response property throughout the ultra-strong coupling regime. We find that in
a sudden quantum quench, the coherent state approach produces physical
artifacts, such as improper relaxation to the steady state. These previously
unnoticed problems are related to the simplified form of the ansatz that
generates spurious correlations within the bath. In the scattering problem, NRG
is used to find the transmission and reflection of a single photon, as well as
the inelastic scattering of that single photon. Simple analytical formulas are
established and tested against the NRG data that predict quantitatively the
transport coefficients for up to moderate environmental impedance. These
formulas resolve pending issues regarding the presence of inelastic losses in
the spin-boson model near absorption resonances, and could be used for
comparison to experiments in Josephson waveguide QED. Finally, the scattering
results using the coherent state wavefunction approach are compared favorably
to the NRG results for very weak incident intensity. We end our study by
presenting results at higher power where the response of the system is
nonlinear.

explore all states over time, known as ergodic dynamics. In isolated quantum
systems, however, the occurrence of ergodic behavior has remained an
outstanding question. Here, we demonstrate ergodic dynamics in a small quantum
system consisting of only three superconducting qubits. The qubits undergo a
sequence of rotations and interactions and we measure the evolution of the
density matrix. Maps of the entanglement entropy show that the full system can
act like a reservoir for individual qubits, increasing their entropy through
entanglement. Surprisingly, these maps bear a strong resemblance to the phase

with higher entanglement entropy. We further show that in regions of high

which holds a potential for explaining the mystery of high-temperature
superconductivity. Recent progress in ultracold atoms in optical lattices has
paved the way to studying the model's phase diagram using the tools of quantum
simulation, which emerged as a promising alternative to the numerical
calculations plagued by the infamous sign problem. However, the temperatures
achieved using elaborate laser cooling protocols so far have been too high to
show the appearance of antiferromagnetic and superconducting quantum phases
directly. In this work, we demonstrate that using the machinery of dissipative
quantum state engineering, one can efficiently prepare antiferromagnetic order
in present-day experiments with ultracold fermions. The core of the approach is
to add incoherent laser scattering in such a way that the antiferromagnetic
state emerges as the dark state of the driven-dissipative dynamics. In order to
elucidate the development of the antiferromagnetic order we employ two
complementary techniques: Monte Carlo wave function simulations for small

operating in the thermodynamic limit. The controlled dissipation channels

with solid-state sources, however absolute source efficiencies remain close to
the 1% level, and indistinguishability only demonstrated for photons emitted
consecutively on the few nanosecond scale. Here we employ deterministic quantum
dot-micropillar devices to demonstrate solid-state single-photon sources with
scalable performance. In one device, an absolute brightness at the output of a
single-mode fibre of 14% and purities of 97.1-99.0% are demonstrated. When
non-resontantly excited, it emits a long stream of photons that exhibit
indistinguishability up to 70%---above the classical limit of 50%---even after
33 consecutively emitted photons, a 400 ns separation between them. Resonant
excitation in other devices results in near-optimal indistinguishability

transport - we prove that non-Gaussian initial states become locally
indistinguishable from fermionic Gaussian states after a short and well

pure and mixed initial states, including thermal and ground states of
interacting Hamiltonians on and large classes of lattices as well as certain

within the framework given by quantum mechanics (QM). In a sense, QM therefore
has the character of a metaphysical theory. Consequently, if it is possible to
derive QM from more basic principles, these principles should be of general,
philosophical nature. Here, we derive the formalism of QM from well-motivated
epistemic principles. A key assumption is that a physical theory that relies on
entities or distinctions that are unknowable in principle gives rise to wrong
predictions. First, an epistemic formalism is developed, using concepts like
knowledge and potential knowledge, identifying a physical state $S$ with the
potential knowledge of the physical world. It is demonstrated that QM emerges
from this formalism. However, Hilbert spaces, wave functions and probabilities
are defined in certain well-defined observational contexts only. This means
that the epistemic formalism is broader than QM. In the fundamental layer of
description, the physical state $S$ is a subset of a state space
$\mathcal{S}=\{Z\}$, such that $S$ always contains many elements $Z$. These
elements correspond to unattainable states of complete knowledge of the world.
The evolution of $S$ cannot be determined in terms of the individual evolution
of the elements $Z$, unlike the evolution of an ensemble in classical phase
space. The evolution of $S$ is described in terms of sequential time $n\in
\mathbf{\mathbb{N}}$, which is updated according to $n\rightarrow n+1$ each
time an event occurs, each time potential knowledge changes. Sequential time
$n$ can be separated from relational time $t$, which describes distances
between events in space-time. There is an entire space-time associated with
each $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at sequential time $n$ about
the temporal relations between present and past events.

a two-level system (TLS) driven by any periodic driving and coupled to multiple
reservoirs. The formalism is derived analytically based on the combination of
Floquet theory and Born-Markov master equation. The formalism allows us to
calculate the spectrum when the Floquet states and quasienergies are
analytically or numerically solved for simple or complicated driving fields. We
can systematically explore the spectral features by implementing the present
formalism. To exemplify this theory, we apply the unified formalism to
comprehensively study a generic model that a harmonically driven TLS is
simultaneously coupled to a radiative reservoir and a dephasing reservoir. We
demonstrate that the significant features of the fluorescence spectra, the
driving-induced asymmetry and the dephasing-induced asymmetry, can be
attributed to the violation of detailed balance condition, and explained in
terms of the driving-related transition quantities between Floquet-states and
their steady populations. In addition, we find the distinguished features of
the fluorescence spectra under the biharmonic and multiharmonic driving fields
in contrast with that of the harmonic driving case. In the case of the
biharmonic driving, we find that the spectra is significantly different from
the result of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) under the multiple
resonance conditions. By the three concrete applications, we illustrate that
the present formalism provides a routine tool for comprehensively exploring the

characterize the kernel of the retarded response function, under the assumption
that the initial state is a ground state. In this article I demonstrate its
generalization to mixed states (ensembles). To make the proof work, the weights
in the ensemble need to be decreasing for increasing energies of the pure
states from which the mixed state is constructed. The resulting conditions are
not easy to verify, but under the additional assumptions that the ensemble
weights are directly related to the energies and that the full spectrum of the
Hamiltonian participates in the ensemble, it is shown that potentials only
belong to the kernel of the retarded response function if they commute with the
initial Hamiltonian. These additional assumptions are valid for thermodynamic
ensembles, which makes this result also physically relevant. The conditions on
the potentials for the thermodynamic ensembles are much stronger than in the

quantum-mechanical particles have been extensively studied experimentally and
theoretically, experimental investigations of the real time evolution of
magnetization in the quantum regime were not possible until recent developments
in pump-probe techniques. Here we investigate the quantum dynamics of effective
spin systems by means of analytical and numerical treatments. Particular
attention is paid to the quantum revival time and its relation to the
magnetization tunneling. The quantum revival time has been initially defined as
the recurrence time of a total wave-function. Here we show that the quantum
revivals of wave-functions and expectation values in spin systems may be quite
different which gives rise to a more sophisticated definition of the quantum
revival within the realm of experimental research. Particularly, the revival
times for integer spins coincide which is not the case for half-integer spins.
Furthermore, the quantum revival is found to be shortest for integer ratios
between the on-site anisotropy and an external magnetic field paving the way to
novel methods of anisotropy measurements. We show that the quantum tunneling of
magnetization at avoided level crossing is coherent to the quantum revival time
of expectation values, leading to a connection between these two fundamental
properties of quantum mechanical spins.

interesting to know what kind of states can generate EPR nonlocal correlations
in the simplest nontrivial scenario, that is, two projective measurements for
each party that share a two-qubit state. In this paper we settle this problem
by deriving a necessary and sufficient analytical criterion. It turns out that
a two-qubit state can demonstrate EPR nonlocal correlations in this scenario
iff it can demonstrate Bell nonlocal correlations. This phenomenon is in sharp
contrast with the strict hierarchy expected between the two forms of
nonlocality. However, the strict hierarchy can emerge if both parties are
restricted to performing mutually unbiased measurements. In addition, we

Meanwhile the industry prefers practical and easier solutions, even without
security verification in some cases. In this paper, we present a concrete
example of ID Quantique's random-detector-efficiency countermeasure against
detector blinding attacks. As a third-party tester, we have found that the
first industrial implementation of this countermeasure is effective against the
original blinding attack, but not immune to a modified blinding attack.
Moreover, we show experimentally that the full countermeasure as in academic
proposal [C. C. W. Lim et al., IEEE J. Sel. Top. Quantum Electron. 21, 6601305
(2015)] is still vulnerable against the modified blinding attack. Our testing
results show several specific disparities between the industrial practical
solution and the academic perfect solutions. Our work illustrates that forming
an implementation-and-testing closed loop is necessary to bridge the gaps and
improve the practical security of QKD systems.

to quantum dynamics on general graph structures. For so, we discuss such class
of systems under the energy domain Green's function ($G$) framework. Such
approach is particularly interesting because $G$ can be written as a sum over
classical-like paths, where local quantum effects are taking into account
through the scattering matrix amplitudes (basically, transmission and
reflection coefficients) defined on each one of the graph vertices. So, the
{\em exact} $G$ has the functional form of a generalized semiclassical formula,
which through different calculation techniques (addressed in details here)
always can be cast into a closed analytic expression. This allows to solve
exactly arbitrary large (although finite) graphs in a recursive and fast way.
Using the Green's function method, we survey many properties for open and
closed quantum graphs, like scattering solutions for the former and
eigenspectrum and eigenstates for the latter, also addressing quasi-bound
states. Concrete examples, like cube, binary trees and Sierpi\'nski-like,
topologies are considered. Along the work, possible distinct applications using
the Green's function methods for quantum graphs are outlined.

I -- The 21 cm Line</title><description>  We have applied the concept of superradiance introduced by Dicke in 1954 to
astrophysics by extending the corresponding analysis to the magnetic dipole
interaction characterizing the atomic hydrogen 21 cm line. Although it is
unlikely that superradiance could take place in thermally relaxed regions and
that the lack of observational evidence of masers for this transition reduces
the probability of detecting superradiance, in situations where the conditions
necessary for superradiance are met (i.e., close atomic spacing, high velocity
coherence, population inversion, and long dephasing time-scales compared to
those related to coherent behavior), our results suggest that relatively low
levels of population inversion over short astronomical length-scales (e.g., as
compared to those required for maser amplification) can lead to the cooperative
behavior required for superradiance in the ISM. Given the results of our
analysis, we expect the observational properties of 21-cm superradiance to be
characterized by the emission of high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like
features potentially taking place over short periods ranging from minutes to
days.

II -- The OH 1612 MHz Line</title><description>  We apply the concept of superradiance introduced by Dicke in 1954 to the OH
molecule 1612 MHz spectral line often used for the detection of masers in
circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars. As the detection of 1612 MHz OH
masers in the outer shells of envelopes of these stars implies the existence of
a population inversion and a high level of velocity coherence, and that these
are two necessary requirements for superradiance, we investigate whether
superradiance can also happen in these regions. Superradiance is characterized
by high intensity, spatially compact, burst-like features taking place over
time-scales on the order of seconds to years, depending on the size and
physical conditions present in the regions harboring such sources of radiation.
Our analysis suggests that superradiance provides a valid explanation for
previous observations of intensity flares detected in that spectral line for
the U Orionis Mira star and the IRAS18276-1431 pre-planetary nebula.

special phenomena that exist only in the transient regime. Besides how fast the
steady states are approached, one interesting aspect of transient transport
arises from its strong dependence on the initial state of the system. Here we
address the issue of how the symmetries embedded in the initial state interplay
with those of the system structure in the course of transient transports. We
explicitly explore the transient currents arising from various initial
occupations in a double-quantum-dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. We find
symmetry relations between the transient in-tunneling and out-tunneling
dynamics for initially empty or full quantum dots when the energy levels in the
electrodes are symmetrically distributed with respect to the energy levels in
the QDs. This is true for whatever applied fluxes. We also find the flux-even
components of the currents and the flux-odd components of the currents exhibit
distinct cross-lead symmetric relations.

Here, we report the realization of a photonic space-time transcoder, by which
light with an arbitrary OAM superposition is experimentally converted into a

that coherence is well conserved and there is no cross-talk between orthogonal

frequency shifts, due to atomic motion can play an important role in adiabatic
population transfer processes of atomic internal states by a pair of laser
fields. For the limiting case of slow atoms ( Doppler shift much smaller than
the photon recoil energy) the atoms occupy the same target state regardless of
the order of switching of laser fields, while for the case of fast atoms
interacting with the intuitive sequence of pulses, the target state is the
intermediate atomic state. It is shown that these processes are robust with

fundamental importance but also has recently been confirmed in a laboratory
experiment. In this paper, we study the vacuum excitation of a scalar field by
the instantaneous appearance and disappearance of a both-sided Dirichlet wall
in the middle of a 1D cavity, as toy models of bifurcating and merging
spacetimes, respectively. It is shown that the energy flux emitted positively
diverges on the null lines emanating from the (dis-)appearance event, which is
analogous to the result of Anderson and DeWitt. This result suggests that the
semiclassical effect prevents the spacetime both from bifurcating and merging.
In addition, we argue that the diverging flux in the disappearance case plays
an interesting role to compensate for the lowness of ambient energy density
after the disappearance, which is lower than the zero-point level.

  gain, and complete positivity</title><description>  There are several inequalities in physics which limit how well we can process
physical systems to achieve some intended goal, including the second law of
thermodynamics, entropy bounds in quantum information theory, and the
uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Recent results provide physically
meaningful enhancements of these limiting statements, determining how well one
can attempt to reverse an irreversible process. In this paper, we apply and
extend these results to give strong enhancements to several entropy
inequalities, having to do with entropy gain, information gain, entropic
disturbance, and complete positivity of open quantum systems dynamics. Our
first result is a remainder term for the entropy gain of a quantum channel.
This result implies that a small increase in entropy under the action of a
subunital channel is a witness to the fact that the channel's adjoint can be
used as a recovery map to undo the action of the original channel. Our second
result regards the information gain of a quantum measurement, both without and
with quantum side information. We find here that a small information gain
implies that it is possible to undo the action of the original measurement if
it is efficient. The result also has operational ramifications for the
information-theoretic tasks known as measurement compression without and with
quantum side information. Our third result shows that the loss of Holevo
information caused by the action of a noisy channel on an input ensemble of
quantum states is small if and only if the noise can be approximately corrected
on average. We finally establish that the reduced dynamics of a
system-environment interaction are approximately completely positive and
trace-preserving if and only if the data processing inequality holds
approximately.

Burgarth et al., Nat. Commun. 5, 5173 (2014)] that a strong amplitude damping
process applied locally on a part of a quantum system can have a beneficial
effect on the dynamics of the remaining part of the system. Quantum operations
that cannot be implemented without the dissipation become achievable by the
action of the strong dissipative process. Here we generalize this idea by
identifying decoherence-free subspaces (DFS's) as the subspaces in which the
dynamics becomes more complex. Applying methods from quantum control theory we
characterize the set of reachable operations within the DFS's. We provide three
examples which become fully controllable within the DFS's while the control
over the original Hilbert space in the absence of dissipation is trivial. In
particular, we show that the (classical) Ising Hamiltonian is turned into a
Heisenberg Hamiltonian by strong collective decoherence, which provides
universal quantum computation within the DFS's. Moreover we perform numerical
gate optimization to study how the process fidelity scales with the noise
strength. As a byproduct a subsystem fidelity which can be applied in other
optimization problems for open quantum systems is developed.

work and applied to the problem of collapse. The first category is concerned
with local and transient features of the entanglement between a macroscopic
measuring system and a measured one. These properties result directly from the
Schr\&quot;odinger equation. They cannot be formulated in terms of observables, do
not affect the wave functions themselves but express their history in an
irreversible way. They carry a specific new kind of local probabilities, which
evolve with a finite velocity under nonlinear wave equations. The second
category of results extends these local properties to the case of a macroscopic
system and its environment. Fluctuations in their interaction are predicted
then and generate a specific incoherence in the quantum state of the system.
These two kinds of effects act together when a macroscopic measuring system
interacts with a measured system and with an environment. Their combination
yields then an explicit and effective mechanism of collapse, with a random
behavior resulting from random incoherence. Born's basic probability rule for
the results of measurements turns out then simply a consequence of quantum
dynamics. Some conjectures still enter into the derivation of these effects,
which one may recognize to look hardly credible at first sight. They fit
however so well together that one proposes a more thorough investigation of
their approach as a promising strategy for a self-contained explanation of
collapse.

a unique (fixed) decomposition of the system into subsystems, without fully
exploiting the rich structure of the state-space. Here, we show several
examples in which the consideration of different ways to decompose a physical
system enhances the quantum resources and accounts for a more flexible
definition of quantumness-measures. Furthermore, we give a new perspective
regarding how to reassess the fact that local operations play a key role in
general quantumness-measures that go beyond entanglement --as discord-like
ones. We propose a way to quantify the maximum quantumness of a given state.
Applying our definition to low-dimensional bipartite states, we show that
different behaviours are reported for separable and entangled states than those
corresponding to the usual measures of quantum correlations. We show that there
is a close link between our proposal and the criterion to witness quantum
correlations based on the rank of the correlation matrix, proposed by Daki\'c,

differences in Casimir energies are quite often finite --- a fortunate
circumstance which luckily made some of the early calculations, (for instance,

finite? When the Casimir energy differences are not finite, can anything useful
be said? We shall see that it is the difference in the first few Seeley-DeWitt
coefficients that is central to answering these questions. In particular, for
any collection of conductors (perfect or imperfect) and/or dielectrics, as long

  electric dipole in front of a flat dielectric surface</title><description>  We investigate spontaneous emission of a two-level atom with an arbitrarily
polarized electric dipole in front of a flat dielectric surface. We treat the
general case where the atomic dipole matrix element is a complex vector, that
is, the atomic dipole can rotate with time in space. We calculate the rates of
spontaneous emission into evanescent and radiation modes and study the angular
densities of the rates in the space of wave vectors for the field modes. We
show that, when the ellipticity of the atomic dipole is not zero, the angular
density of the spontaneous emission rate of the atom may have different values
for modes with opposite in-plane wave vectors. We find that this asymmetry of
the angular density of the spontaneous emission rate under central inversion in
the space of in-plane wave vectors is a result of spin-orbit coupling of light
and occurs when the ellipticity vector of the atomic dipole polarization
overlaps with the ellipticity vector of the field mode polarization. Due to the
fast decay of the field in the evanescent modes, the difference between the
rates of spontaneous emission into evanescent modes with opposite in-plane wave
vectors decreases monotonically with increasing distance from the atom to the
interface. Due to the oscillatory behavior of the interference between the
emitted and reflected fields, the difference between the rates of spontaneous
emission into radiation modes with opposite in-plane wave vectors oscillates
with increasing distance from the atom to the interface. This difference can be
positive or negative, depending on the atom-interface distance, and is zero for
the zero distance.

information, especially with the emergence of more advanced experimental
implementations of computation and secure communication. Within this, the
theory of device-independent robust self-testing via Bell tests has reached a
level of maturity now that many quantum states and measurements can be verified
without direct access to the quantum systems: interaction with the devices is
solely classical. However, the requirements for this robust level of
verification are daunting and require high levels of experimental accuracy. In
this paper we discuss the possibility of self-testing where we have direct
access to part of the quantum device. This motivates the study of self-testing
via EPR-steering, an intermediate form of entanglement verification between
full state tomography and a Bell test. Quantum non-locality implies
EPR-steering so results in the former can apply in the latter, but we ask what
advantages may be gleaned from the latter over the former given that one can do
partial state tomography. We show in the case of self-testing a maximally
entangled two-qubit state, or ebit, EPR-steering allows for simpler analysis
and better error tolerance than in the case of full device-independence. On the
other hand, this improvement is only a constant improvement and (up to
constants) is the best one can hope for. Finally, we indicate that the main
advantage in self-testing based on EPR-steering could be in the case of
self-testing multi-partite quantum states and measurements. For example, it may
be easier to establish a tensor product structure for a particular party's
Hilbert space even if we do not have access to their part of the global quantum
system.

i.e. observables, such as the number of excitations, stop oscillating and reach

assuming the system can be effectively described by a thermal-like

direct exact numerical simulation. This allows us to show the limitations of

single-photon sources typically employ resonant excitation pulses with fixed
repetition rates, creating a string of single photons with predetermined
arrival times. However, in future applications, an independent electronic
signal from a larger quantum circuit or network will trigger the generation of
an indistinguishable photon. Further, operating the photon source up to the
limit imposed by its lifetime is desirable. Here, we report on the application
of a true on-demand approach in which we can electronically trigger the precise
arrival time of a single photon as well as control the excitation pulse
duration based on resonance fluorescence from a single InAs/GaAs quantum dot.
We investigate in detail the effect of the finite duration of an excitation
$\pi$ pulse on the degree of photon antibunching. Finally, we demonstrate that
highly indistinguishable single photons can be generated using this on-demand

explicit method to find the ultimate bound on the Allan variance of an atomic

While the method is rigorous and completely general, it becomes numerically

because they obey entanglement area laws. They have been used to construct
explicit simple models realizing many of the interesting structural features of
the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the non-uniqueness of bulk operator
reconstruction in the boundary theory. In this article, we explore the
holographic properties of networks of random tensors. We find that our models
obey the Ryu-Takayanagi entropy formula for all boundary regions, whether
connected or not, a fact closely related to known properties of the
multipartite entanglement of assistance. Moreover, we find that all boundary
regions faithfully encode the physics of their entire bulk entanglement wedges,
not just their smaller causal wedges. Our method is to interpret the average
over random tensors as the partition function of a classical ferromagnetic
Ising model, so that the minimal surfaces of Ryu-Takayanagi appear as domain
walls. Upon including the analog of a bulk field, we find that our model
reproduces the expected corrections to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula: the bulk
minimal surface is displaced and the entropy is augmented by the entanglement
of the bulk field. Increasing the entanglement of the bulk field ultimately
creates the analog of a black hole, with an associated Hawking-Page phase
transition. Extrapolating bulk correlation functions to the boundary permits
the calculation of the scaling dimensions of boundary operators, which exhibit
a large gap between a small number of low-dimension operators and the rest, a
known necessary condition for holography. While we primarily focus on the
AdS/CFT case, the main results of the article define a more general form of
bulk-boundary correspondence which could be useful for extending holography to
other spacetimes.

ground state of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice for square and
cylindrical subsystems. We find that, for both the subsystems, the
free-fermionic contribution to the entanglement entropy $S_E$ exhibits
signatures of the phase transitions between the gapless and gapped phases.
However, we find that $S_E$ does not show an expected monotonic behaviour as a
function of the coupling $J_z$ between the suitably defined one-dimensional
chains within the gapless phase for either geometry; moreover the system
generically reaches a point of minimum entanglement within the gapless phase
before the entanglement saturates or increases again until the gapped phase is
reached. This may be attributed to the competition between the nearest
neighbour correlation functions of the $x-x$ and $z-z$ bonds, and to the onset
of gapless $\vec{k}$-modes in the bulk spectrum. On the other hand $S_E$ always
monotonically varies with $J_z$ in the gapped phase independent of the
subregion size or shape. Finally, further confirming the Li-Haldane conjecture,
we find that the Schmidt gap $\Delta$ defined from the entanglement spectrum
also signals the topological transitions but only if there are corresponding
zero energy Majorana edge states that simultaneously appear or disappear across
the transitions. We analytically corroborate some of our results on
entanglement entropy, Schmidt gap and the bulk-edge correspondence using
perturbation theory.

steering analogy of the CHSH inequality, a generalisation of the result of
Cavalcanti et al, JOSA B, 32(4), A74 (2015). We show that violation of the

maximum violation of our EPR-steering inequality is equal to that for the CHSH

(QOCT), which utilizes two-photon interference between entangled photon pairs,
is a promising approach to overcome the problem with optical coherence
tomography (OCT): As the resolution of OCT becomes higher, degradation of the

report on the realization of 0.54 $\mu$m resolution two-photon interference,
which surpasses the current record resolution 0.75 $\mu$m of low-coherence
interference for OCT. In addition, the resolution for QOCT showed almost no

the interaction is turned off, which apply to arbitrary coupling functions. We
investigate the final state of the system and compute all physically relevant
quantities, such as average particle number, entanglement and change in energy.
Our techniques can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, which include
implementations of time dependent two-mode squeezing, coupled harmonic
oscillators, harmonic oscillators coupled to light. Furthermore, these
techniques can be extended to more complicated time-dependent quadratic
Hamiltonians. We briefly discuss possible applications within the area of
relativistic and quantum information.

  one-variable quantum systems</title><description>  We present a scheme to estimate Gaussian states of one-dimensional continuous
variable systems, based on weak (unsharp) quantum measurements. The estimation
of a Gaussian state requires us to find position ($q$), momentum ($p$) and
their second order moments. We measure $q$ weakly and follow it up with a
projective measurement of $p$ on half of the ensemble, and on the other half we
measure $p$ weakly followed by a projective measurement of $q$. In each case we
use the state twice before discarding it. We compare our results with
projective measurements and demonstrate that under certain conditions such weak
measurement-based estimation schemes, where recycling of the states is
possible, can outperform projective measurement-based state estimation schemes.

quantum tomography, which is an area of science where quantum Physics and
linear algebra overlap. In this article we introduce the algebraic structure of
the parametric-dependent quantum channels for 2-level and 3-level systems such
that the generator of evolution corresponding with the Kraus operators has no
degenerate eigenvalues. In such cases the index of cyclicity of the generator
is equal $1$, which physically means that there exists one observable the
measurement of which performed sufficient number of times at distinct instants
provides enough data to reconstruct the initial density matrix and,
consequently, the trajectory of the state. Necessary conditions for the
parameters and relations between them are introduced. The results presented in
this paper seem to have considerable potential applications in experiments due
to the fact that one can perform quantum tomography by conducting only one kind
of measurement. Therefore, the analyzed evolution models can be considered
optimal in the context of quantum tomography. Finally, we also introduce some
remarks concerning optimal evolution models in case of $n-$dimensional Hilbert
space.

  conditions</title><description>  We revisit the conserved quantities of the spin-1/2 XY model with open
boundary conditions. In the absence of a transverse field, we find new families
of local charges and show that half of the seeming conservation laws are
conserved only if the number of sites is odd. In even chains the set of
noninteracting charges is abelian, like in the periodic case when the number of
sites is odd. In odd chains the set is doubled and becomes non-abelian, like in
even periodic chains. The dependence of the charges on the parity of the
chain's size undermines the common belief that the thermodynamic limit of
diagonal ensembles exists. We consider also the transverse-field Ising chain,
where the situation is more ordinary. The generalization to the XY model in a
transverse field is not straightforward and we propose a general framework to
carry out similar calculations. We conjecture the form of the bulk part of the
local charges and discuss the emergence of quasilocal conserved quantities. We
provide evidence that in a region of the parameter space there is a reduction
of the number of quasilocal conservation laws. As a by-product, we study a
class of block-Toeplitz-plus-Hankel operators and identify the conditions that
their symbols satisfy in order to commute with a given block-Toeplitz.

Compared with previous protocols, our schemes greatly simplify the

the measured spatial-mode state to assist in the analysis of the polarization

models with variable-range power-law interactions: a long-range transverse
Ising model, which has recently been realised in chains of trapped ions, and a
long-range lattice model for spinless fermions with long-range tunnelling. For
the transverse Ising model, the spreading of correlations and growth of
entanglement are computed using numerical matrix product state techniques, and
are compared with exact solutions for the fermionic tunnelling model. We
identify transitions between regimes with and without an apparent linear light
cone for correlations, which correspond closely between the two models. For
long-range interactions (in terms of separation distance r, decaying slower
than 1/r), we find that despite the lack of a light-cone, correlations grow
slowly as a power law at short times, and that -- depending on the structure of
the initial state -- the growth of entanglement can also be sublinear. These
results are understood through analytical calculations, and should be

  Bose-Einstein condensates</title><description>  It is well known that in the presence of a ring cavity the light scattering
from a uniform atomic ensemble can become unstable resulting in the collective
atomic recoil lasing. This is the result of a positive feedback due to the
cavity. We propose to add an additional electronic feedback loop based on the
photodetection of the scattered light. The advantage is a great flexibility in
choosing the feedback algorithm, since manipulations with electric signals are
very well developed. In this paper we address the application of such a
feedback to atoms in the Bose-Einstein condensed state and explore the quantum
noise due to the incoherent feedback action. We show that although the feedback
based on the photodetection does not change the local stability of the initial
uniform distribution with respect to small disturbances, it reduces the region
of attraction of the uniform equilibrium. The feedback-induced nonlinearity
enables quantum fluctuations to bring the system out of the stability region
and cause an exponential growth even if the uniform state is globally stable
without the feedback. Using numerical solution of the feedback master equation
we show that there is no feedback-induced noise in the quadratures of the
excited atomic and light modes. The feedback loop, however, introduces
additional noise into the number of quanta of these modes. Importantly, the
feedback opens an opportunity to position the modulated BEC inside a cavity as
well as tune the phase of scattered light. This can find applications in
precision measurements and quantum simulations.

mainly from a theoretical perspective. Few experimental systems were initially
recognized to exhibit the versatility of being sensitive, at the same time, to
their classical and quantum dynamics. Rydberg atoms provided the main testing
ground of Quantum Chaos concepts until the early nineties, marked by the
development of microwave billiards, ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices, and
low-temperature transport in mesoscopic semiconductor structures. The
mesoscopic regime is attained in small condensed matter systems at sufficiently
low temperatures for the electrons to propagate coherently across the sample.
The quantum coherence of electrons, together with the ballistic motion
characteristic of ultra-clean microstructures, motivated the proposal of
mesocopic systems as a very special laboratory for performing measurements and
testing the theoretical ideas of Quantum Chaos. Experimental realizations and
many important developments, reviewed in this article, followed from such a

confined by a toroidal trap with a tight confinement in the radial direction.
Gross-Pitaevskii simulations show that solitons can be long living objects
passing through many collisional processes. We have observed quite different
behaviors depending on the soliton velocity. Very slow solitons, obtained by
perturbing the stationary solitonic profile, move with a constant angular
velocity until they collide elastically and move in the opposite direction
without showing any sign of lowering their energy. In this case the density
notches are always well separated and the fronts are sharp and straight. Faster
solitons present vortices around the notches, which play a central role during
the collisions. We have found that in these processes the solitons lose energy,
as the outgoing velocity turns out to be larger than the incoming one. To study
the dynamics, we model the gray soliton state with a free parameter that is
related to the soliton velocity. We further analyze the energy, soliton
velocity and turning points in terms of such a free parameter, finding that the
main features are in accordance with the infinite one-dimensional system.

We here investigate the exact DFS of two spatially separated quantum systems

non-Markovian zero-temperature bosonic environment. The exact
distance-dependent DFS and the explicit criterion for forming the DFS are
obtained analytically, which reveal that the DFS can arise only in
one-dimensional environment. It is remarkable to further find that the DFS is
just the system reduced state of the famous bound state in the continuum (BIC)
of the total system predicted by Wigner and von Neumann. On the one hand our
result gives the insight to the physical nature of the DFS, and on the other it
supplies an experimentally accessible scheme to realize the mathematically

regime where device function is affected not only by the presence of individual
dopants, but more critically their position in the structure. The quantitative
determination of the positions of subsurface dopant atoms is an important issue
in a range of applications from channel doping in ultra-scaled transistors to
quantum information processing, and hence poses a significant challenge. Here,
we establish a metrology combining low-temperature scanning tunnelling
microscopy (STM) imaging and a comprehensive quantum treatment of the
dopant-STM system to pin-point the exact lattice-site location of sub-surface
dopants in silicon. The technique is underpinned by the observation that STM
images of sub surface dopants typically contain many atomic-sized features in
ordered patterns, which are highly sensitive to the details of the STM tip
orbital and the absolute lattice-site position of the dopant atom itself. We
demonstrate the technique on two types of dopant samples in silicon -- the
first where phosphorus dopants are placed with high precision, and a second
containing randomly placed arsenic dopants. Based on the quantitative agreement
between STM measurements and multi-million-atom calculations, the precise
lattice site of these dopants is determined, demonstrating that the metrology
works to depths of about 36 lattice planes. The ability to uniquely determine
the exact positions of sub-surface dopants down to depths of 5 nm will provide
critical knowledge in the design and optimisation of nanoscale devices for both

conflicting interest games. However, classical equilibrium strategies can be of
two types, fair and unfair. Whereas in fair equilibrium payoffs of different
players are same, in unfair case they differ. Advantage of nonlocal correlation

greatly practical importance due to its built-in fault tolerance, coherence
stabilization virtues, and short run-time. Here we propose some compact schemes
to implement two- and three-qubit controlled unitary quantum gates and Fredkin

the target qubit is an arbitrary single-qubit gate operation. The controlled
quantum gates can be directly implemented using non-adiabatic holonomy in
decoherence-free subspaces and the required resource for the decoherence-free
subspace encoding is minimal by using only two neighboring physical qubits
undergoing collective dephasing to encode a logical qubit.

The measured spectroscopic response enables optical, atom-based electric field
measurements of high-power microwaves. In our experiments, microwaves are
irradiated into a room-temperature rubidium vapor cell. The microwaves are
tuned near the two-photon 65D-66D Rydberg transition and reach an electric
field strength of 230V/m, about 20% of the microwave ionization threshold of
these atoms. A Floquet treatment is used to model the Rydberg level energies
and their excitation rates. We arrive at an empirical model for the
field-strength distribution inside the spectroscopic cell that yields excellent
overall agreement between the measured and calculated Rydberg EIT-Floquet

replication that are directly amenable to optical or mechanical implementation.
We use a new class of homologically-constructed CV quantum error correcting

replication. As compared to schemes encoding qubits, our CV solution requires
half as many shares per encoded system. We also provide an optimized five-mode
strategy for replicating quantum information in a particular configuration of

good sensing, efforts to harness entanglement to improve sensitivity remain
tantalizing. Here we explore the role of interactions in an analogy between
atomic gyroscopes and SQUIDs, motivated by recent experiments realizing ring
shaped traps for ultracold atoms. We explore the one-dimensional limit of these
ring systems with a moving weak barrier, such as that provided by a
blue-detuned laser beam. In this limit, we employ Luttinger liquid theory and
find an analogy with the superconducting phase-slip qubit, in which the
topological charge associated with persistent currents can be put into
superposition. In particular, we find that strongly-interacting atoms in such a

of this new sensor to an equivalent non-interacting atom interferometer, and
find improvements in sensitivity and bandwidth beyond the atomic shot-noise

reached thermal equilibrium when they undergo the transition to a coherent

for condensation, namely the phase diagram. In this work, we have created a
polariton gas in a semiconductor microcavity in which the quasiparticles have a
lifetime much longer than their thermalization time. This allows them to reach
thermal equilibrium in a laser-generated confining trap. Their energy
distributions are well fit by equilibrium Bose-Einstein distributions over a
broad range of densities and temperatures from very low densities all the way
up to the threshold for Bose-Einstein condensation. The good fits of the

  transitions</title><description>  The mechanism of the transition of a dynamical system from quantum to
classical mechanics is of continuing interest. Practically it is of importance
for the interpretation of multi-particle coincidence measurements performed at
macroscopic distances from a microscopic reaction zone. Here we prove the
generalized iimaging theorem which shows that the spatial wave function of any
multi-particle quantum system, propagating over distances and times large on an
atomic scale but still microscopic, and subject to deterministic external
fields and particle interactions, becomes proportional to the initial momentum
wave function where the position and momentum coordinates define a classical
trajectory. Currently, the quantum to classical transition is considered to
occur via decoherence caused by stochastic interaction with an environment. The
imaging theorem arises from unitary Schroedinger propagation and so is valid
without any environmental interaction. It implies that a simultaneous
measurement of both position and momentum will define a unique classical
trajectory, whereas a less complete measurement of say position alone can lead
to quantum interference effects.

Relativity. In this article the possibility that the wavefunction evolves
continuously and hopefully unitarily during the measurement process is
analyzed. It is argued that such a solution has to be formulated using a time
symmetric replacement of the initial value problem in Quantum Mechanics. Major
difficulties in apparent conflict with unitary evolution are identified, but
eventually its possibility is not completely ruled out. This interpretation is
in a weakened sense both local and realistic, without contradicting Bell's

quantum statistical mechanics. What is more, recent seminal experimental

building our toolbox from techniques available in the laboratory, including
on-site addressing, super-lattices, and time-of-flight measurements,
identifying witnesses based on fluctuations, density-density correlators,

  Mechanical Oscillator</title><description>  Quantum enhanced sensing is a powerful technique in which nonclassical states
are used to improve the sensitivity of a measurement. For enhanced mechanical
displacement sensing, squeezed states of light have been shown to reduce the
photon counting noise that limits the measurement noise floor. It has long been
predicted, however, that suppressing the noise floor with squeezed light should
produce an unavoidable increase in radiation pressure noise that drives the
mechanical system. Such nonclassical radiation pressure forces have thus far
been hidden by insufficient measurement strengths and residual thermal
mechanical motion. Since the ultimate measurement sensitivity relies on the
delicate balance between these two noise sources, the limits of the quantum
enhancement have not been observed. Using a microwave cavity optomechanical
system, we observe the nonclassical radiation pressure noise that necessarily
accompanies any quantum enhancement of the measurement precision. By varying
both the magnitude and phase of the squeezing, we optimize the fundamental
trade-off between mechanical imprecision and backaction noise in accordance
with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As the strength of the measurement
is further increased, radiation pressure forces eventually dominate the
mechanical motion. In this regime, the optomechanical interaction can be
exploited as an efficient quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of the
amplitude fluctuations of the light field. By overwhelming mechanical thermal
noise with radiation pressure by two orders of magnitude, we demonstrate a
mechanically-mediated measurement of the squeezing with an effective homodyne
efficiency of 94%. Thus, with strong radiation pressures forces, mechanical
motion enhances the measurement of nonclassical light, just as nonclassical
light enhances the measurement of the motion.

provides the valuable resource for quantum computation in exceeding the power
of classical algorithms. The exploration of quantum coherence in relativistic
systems is of significance from both the fundamental points of view and
practical applications. We investigate the quantum coherence of two free modes
of scalar and Dirac fields as detected by two relatively accelerated observers
by resorting to the relative entropy of coherence. We show that the relative
entropy of coherence monotonically decreases when acceleration goes up, as a
consequence of the Unruh effect. Specifically, the initial states with
parameters $\alpha=b$ and $\alpha=\sqrt{1-b^2}$ have the same initial relative
entropy coherence at $a=0$ (with $a$ the acceleration), but degrade along two
different trajectories. The relative entropy of coherence reaches vanishing
value in the scalar field in the infinite acceleration limit, but non-vanishing
value in the Dirac field. This suggests that in the Dirac field, the bipartite
state possesses quantum coherence to some extent with the variation of the
relative acceleration, and may lead to potential applications in quantum
computation performed by observers in motion relatively.

Furthermore, our preliminary tests on the information reconciliation suggest

Recently, these states have been observed in the transient dynamics of

this class of systems, including one-photon losses, which are considered
detrimental for the achievement of cat states. We demonstrate that the unique
steady state is a statistical mixture of two cat-like states with opposite

the steady state depends dramatically on the initial state and can pass through
a metastable regime lasting orders of magnitudes longer than the photon
lifetime. By considering individual quantum trajectories in photon-counting
configuration, we find that the system intermittently jumps between two cats.
Finally, we propose and study a feedback protocol based on this behaviour to

  Simulated Annealing</title><description>  Simulated Quantum Annealing (SQA) is a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo algorithm
that samples the equilibrium thermal state of a Quantum Annealing (QA)
Hamiltonian. In addition to simulating quantum systems, SQA has also been
proposed as another physics-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial
optimization, alongside classical simulated annealing. However, in many cases
it remains an open challenge to determine the performance of both QA and SQA.
One piece of evidence for the strength of QA over classical simulated annealing
comes from an example by Farhi, Goldstone and Gutmann . There a bit-symmetric
cost function with a thin, high energy barrier was designed to show an
exponential seperation between classical simulated annealing, for which thermal
fluctuations take exponential time to climb the barrier, and quantum annealing
which passes through the barrier and reaches the global minimum in poly time,
arguably by taking advantage of quantum tunneling. In this work we apply a
comparison method to rigorously show that the Markov chain underlying SQA
efficiently samples the target distribution and finds the global minimum of
this spike cost function in polynomial time. Our work provides evidence for the
growing consensus that SQA inherits at least some of the advantages of
tunneling in QA, and so QA is unlikely to achieve exponential speedups over
classical computing solely by the use of quantum tunneling. Since we analyze
only a particular model this evidence is not decisive. However, techniques
applied here---including warm starts from the adiabatic path and the use of the
quantum ground state probability distribution to understand the stationary
distribution of SQA---may be valuable for future studies of the performance of
SQA on cost functions for which QA is efficient.

detection noise in the security of a continuous-variable quantum key
distribution, considering the Gaussian protocols on the basis of coherent and
squeezed states and studying them in the conditions of Gaussian lossy and noisy
channels. The influence of such a noise on the security of Gaussian quantum
cryptography can be crucial, even despite the fact that a noise is trusted, due
to a strongly nonlinear behavior of the quantum entropies involved in the
security analysis. We recapitulate the known effect of the preparation noise in
both direct and reverse-reconciliation protocols, as well as the detection
noise in the reverse-reconciliation scenario. As a new result, we show the
negative role of the trusted detection noise in the direct-reconciliation
scheme. We also describe the role of the trusted preparation or detection noise
added at the reference side of the protocols in improving the robustness of the
protocols to the channel noise, confirming the positive effect for the
coherent-state reverse-reconciliation protocol. Finally, we address the
combined effect of trusted noise added both in the source and the detector.

analysis of the challenges involved in performing a successful fast gate. We
show that the RWA is a stable approximation with respect to pulse numbers: the
timescale on which we can neglect terms rotating at the atomic frequency is
negligibly affected by the number of pulses in the fast gate. In contrast, we
show that the laser pulse instability does give rise to a pulse-number

we find bounds on the pulse stability required to achieve two-qubit gate

applications. Positioning the sensor at a distance of a few millimeters from
the nerve, corresponding to the distance between the skin and nerves in
biological studies, we detect the magnetic field generated by an action

determine the activity of the nerve and the temporal shape of the nerve

practical devices for medical diagnostics.

under which condition the coherence can be frozen in a relativistic setting. We
find that the frozen condition is either (i) the initial state is prepared as a
incoherence state, or (ii) the detectors have no interaction with the external
field. That is to say, the decoherence of detectors' quantum state is
irreversible under the influence of thermal noise induced by Unruh radiation.
It is shown that quantum coherence approaches zero only in the limit of an
infinite acceleration, while quantum entanglement could reduce to zero for a
finite acceleration. It is also demonstrated that the robustness of quantum
coherence is better than entanglement under the influence of the atom-field

is more robust than entanglement in an accelerating system and the coherence

gauge theories, based on a local gauge invariance. The simplest of them is
quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is an example of an Abelian gauge theory.
Such theories describe the dynamics of massless photons and their coupling to
matter. However, in two spatial dimension (2D) they are known to exhibit gapped
phases at low temperature. In the realm of quantum spin systems, it remains a
subject of considerable debate if their low energy physics can be described by
emergent gauge degrees of freedom. Here we present a class of simple
two-dimensional models that admit a low energy description in terms of an
Abelian gauge theory. We find rich phase diagrams for these models comprising
exotic deconfined phases and gapless phases - a rare example for 2D Abelian
gauge theories. The counter-intuitive presence of gapless phases in 2D results
from the emergence of additional symmetry in the models. Moreover, we propose
schemes to realize our model with current experiments using ultracold bosonic

heterogeneous dependence of plasmon-enhanced Raman scattering intensity on
laser power. By quantization of the molecular vibration coherent state into
phonon number states, and by incorporating different Raman activities for
different Stokes transitions, we theoretically predict a heterogeneous
multi-stage phonon pumping phenomenon for resonant Raman molecules, which
includes a saturation stage and a stimulated phonon emission stage.
Experimental results are presented to prove the theory, by measuring gold
nanosphere-plane antennas under radially polarized excitation, with a monolayer

conformal systems. In this work we study random spin chains whose couplings
present long range correlations, generated as gaussian fields with a power-law
spectral function. Ground states are always planar valence bond states, and
their statistical ensembles are characterized in terms of their block entropy
and their bond-length distribution, which follow power-laws. We conjecture the
existence of a critical value for the spectral exponent, below which the system
behavior is identical to the case of uncorrelated couplings. Above that
critical value, the entanglement entropy violates the area law and grows as a
power law of the block size, with an exponent which increases from zero to one.
Similar planar bond structures are also found in statistical models of RNA
folding and kinetic roughening, and we trace an analogy between them and
quantum valence bond states. Using an inverse renormalization procedure we
determine the optimal spin-chain couplings which give rise to a given planar
bond structure, and study the statistical properties of the couplings whose

phase-shifts $\delta$ of the particles by a formula first published by Busch et
al. It is here used to find an expression for the \it shift \rm of the energy
levels, caused by the interaction, rather than the perturbed spectrum itself.
In the limit of high energy (large quantum number $n$ of the H.O.) this shift
is shown to be given by $-2\frac{\delta}{\pi}$, also valid in the limit of
infinite as well as zero scattering length at all H.O. energies.
  Numerical investigation shows that the shifts differ from the exact result of
Busch et al, by less than $&lt;\frac{1}{2}\%$ except for $n=0$ when it can be as
large as $\approx 2.5\%$.
  This approximation for the energy-shift is well known from another exactly
solvable model, namely that of two particles interacting in a spherical
infinite square-well trap (or box) of radius $R$ in the limit $R\rightarrow
\infty$, and/or in the limit of large energy. It is in this context referred to
as the \it phase-shift approximation \rm.
  It can be (and has been) used in (infinite) nuclear matter calculations to
calculate the two-body effective interaction in situations where in-medium
effects can be neglected. It has also been used in expressing the energy of
free electrons in a metal.

at least approximately (i.e., for an idealized detector). We argue here in
favor of a rule based on a 1-particle Schrodinger equation with a certain
(absorbing) boundary condition at the ideal detecting surface, first considered
by Werner in 1987. We present a novel derivation of this rule and describe how
it arises as a limit of a &quot;soft&quot; detector represented by an imaginary

preparation schemes. Our analysis provides a lower bound on the control power
required for controlled remote preparation of arbitrary D-dimensional states.
We evaluate several existing controlled remote state preparation protocols and
show that some proposed non-maximally entangled channels are not suitable for
perfect controlled remote preparation of arbitrary quantum states from the con-
troller's point of view. We find that for remotely preparing D-dimensional

theory that allow macroscopic objects to be described in a
measurement-independent fashion, while largely preserving a fully quantum
mechanical description of the microscopic world. Objective collapse theories
are examples which attempt to provide a physical mechanism for wavefunction
collapse, and thereby aim to solve the quantum measurement problem. Here we
describe and implement an experimental protocol capable of constraining
theories of this class, and show how it is related to the original Leggett-Garg
test, yet more noise tolerant and conceptually transparent. By conducting a set
of simple 'prepare, shuffle, measure' tests in a superconducting flux qubit, we
rule out (by over 83 standard deviations) those theories which would deny
coherent superpositions of 170 nA currents over a 9 ns timescale. Further, we
address the 'clumsiness loophole' by determining classical disturbance in a set

curvature perturbation $\zeta$ due to quantum decoherence, focusing on the role
played by squeezed-limit mode couplings. We evolve the quantum state $\Psi$ in
the Schr\&quot;odinger picture, for a generic cubic coupling to additional
environment degrees of freedom. Focusing on the case of minimal gravitational
interactions, we find the evolution of the reduced density matrix for a given
long-wavelength fluctuation by tracing out the other (mostly shorterwavelength)
modes of $\zeta$ as an environment. We show that inflation produces phase
oscillations in the wave functional $\Psi[\zeta(\mathbf{x})]$, which suppress
off-diagonal components of the reduced density matrix, leaving a diagonal
mixture of different classical configurations. Gravitational nonlinearities
thus provide a minimal mechanism for generating classical stochastic
perturbations from inflation. We identify the time when decoherence occurs,
which is delayed after horizon crossing due to the weak coupling, and find that
Hubble-scale modes act as the decohering environment. We also comment on the
observational relevance of decoherence and its relation to the squeezing of the
quantum state.

quantum coherence as a special case. We introduce explicitly and study the
robustness of asymmetry, a quantifier of asymmetry of states that we prove to
have many attractive properties, including efficient numerical computability
via semidefinite programming, and an operational interpretation in a channel

that properly constrained asymmetry witnesses provide lower bounds to the
robustness of asymmetry, which is shown to be a directly measurable quantity
itself. We then focus our attention on coherence witnesses and the robustness

an analysis of its specific relevance in phase discrimination and quantum

immersed in a dielectric medium the photon radiation pressure is proportional
to the medium refractive index n. Our work thus contributes to the longstanding

over many decades. We investigate the time evolution of the Gaussian wave
packets governed by the one dimensional Dirac equation. For the free Dirac
equation, we obtain the evolution profiles analytically in many approximation
regimes, and numerical simulations consistent with other numerical schemes.
Interesting behaviors such as Zitterbewegung and Klein paradox are exhibited.
In particular, the dispersion rate as a function of mass is calculated, and it
yields an interesting result that super-massive and massless particles both
exhibit no dispersion in free space. For the Dirac equation with random
potential or mass, we employ the Chebyshev polynomials expansion of the
propagator operator to numerically investigate the probability profiles of the
displacement distribution when the potential or mass is uniformly distributed.
We observe that the widths of the Gaussian wave packets decrease approximately
with the power law of order $o(s^{-\nu})$ with $\frac{1}{2}&lt;\nu&lt;1$ as the
randomness strength $s$ increases. This suggests an onset of localization, but
it is weaker than Anderson localization.

inserting the detected position, at the time of detection, into the wave

  universal phase dependence and orbital degeneracy</title><description>  We investigate experimentally the supercurrent in a clean carbon nanotube
quantum dot, close to orbital degeneracy, connected to superconducting leads in
a regime of strong competition between local electronic correlations and
superconducting proximity effect. For an odd occupancy of the dot and
intermediate coupling to the reservoir, the Kondo effect can develop in the
normal state and screen the local magnetic moment of the dot. This leads to
singlet-doublet transitions that strongly affect the Josephson effect in a
single-level quantum dot: the sign of the supercurrent changes from positive to
negative (0 to $\pi$-junction). In the regime of strongest competition between
the Kondo effect and proximity effect, meaning that the Kondo temperature
equals the superconducting gap, the magnetic state of the dot undergoes a first
order quantum transition induced by the superconducting phase difference across
the junction. This is revealed experimentally by anharmonic current-phase
relations. In addition, the very specific electronic configuration of clean
carbon nanotubes, with two nearly orbitally degenerated states, leads to
different physics depending whether only one or both quasi-degenerate upper
levels of the dots participate to transport, which is determined by their
occupancy and relative widths. When the transport of Cooper pairs takes place
through only one of these levels, we find that the phase diagram of the
phase-dependent 0-$\pi$ transition is a universal characteristic of a
discontinuous level-crossing quantum transition at zero temperature. In the
case were two levels participate to transport, the nanotube Josephson current
exhibits a continuous 0-$\pi$ transition, independent of the superconducting

Coherent exchange between optical photons and microwave photons will also be a

two harmonic oscillator modes, a microwave cavity mode and a magnetostatic mode
called Kittel mode, where microwave photons and magnons in the respective modes
are strongly coupled and hybridized. An itinerant microwave field and a
travelling optical field can be coupled through the hybrid system, where the
microwave field is coupled to the hybrid system through the cavity mode, while
the optical field addresses the hybrid system through the Kittel mode via
Faraday and inverse Faraday effects. The conversion efficiency is theoretically
analyzed and experimentally evaluated. The possible schemes for improving the

However, experiments have so far been limited to generating only a few squeezed

single-mode squeezing in Laguerre-Gauss and Bessel-Gauss modes, as well as an
arbitrary intensity pattern, all from a single setup using a spatial light

initial squeezing and diffractive losses introduced by the SLM, while no excess

only a portion of the whole system. In particular, we consider Dicke-like
superradiant systems made of an ensmble of two-level atoms interacting with a
single-mode radiation field at zero effective temperature, and address
estimation of the coupling by measurements performed only on radiation. At
first, we obtain analytically the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and show
that optimal estimation of the coupling may be achieved by tuning the frequency
of the radiation field to drive the system towards criticality. The scaling
behavior of the QFI at the critical point is obtained explicitly upon
exploiting the symplectic formalism for Gaussian states. We then analyze the
performances of feasible detection schemes performed only on the radiation
subsystem, namely homodyne detection and photon counting, and show that the
corresponding Fisher Informations (FIs) approach the global QFI in the critical
region. We thus conclude that criticality is a twofold resource. On the one
hand, global QFI diverges at the critical point, i.e. the coupling may be
estimated with the arbitrary precision. On the other hand, the FIs of feasible
local measurements, (which are generally smaller than the QFI out of the
critical region), show the same scaling of the global QFI, i.e. optimal
estimation of coupling may be achieved by locally probing the system, despite
its strongly interacting nature.

Ohmic two-state system by exploiting the equivalence of this model to the
interacting resonant level model. For the thermodynamics, we show, by using the
numerical renormalization group (NRG) method, how the universal specific heat
and susceptibility curves evolve with increasing dissipation strength,
$\alpha$, from those of an isolated two-level system at vanishingly small
dissipation strength, with the characteristic activated-like behavior in this
limit, to those of the isotropic Kondo model in the limit $\alpha\to 1^{-}$.
For the transient dynamics of the two-level system, $P(t)=\langle
\sigma_{z}(t)\rangle$, with initial-state preparation $P(t\leq0)=+1$, we apply
the time-dependent extension of the NRG (TDNRG) to the interacting resonant
level model, and compare the results obtained with those from the
noninteracting-blip approximation (NIBA), the functional renormalization group
(FRG), and the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG).
We demonstrate excellent agreement on short to intermediate time scales between
TDNRG and TD-DMRG for $0\lesssim\alpha \lesssim 0.9$ for $P(t)$, and between
TDNRG and FRG in the vicinity of $\alpha=1/2$. Furthermore, we quantify the
error in the NIBA for a range of $\alpha$, finding significant errors in the
latter even for $0.1\leq \alpha\leq 0.4$. We also briefly discuss why the
long-time errors in the present formulation of the TDNRG prevents an
investigation of the crossover between coherent and incoherent dynamics. Our
results for $P(t)$ at short to intermediate times could act as useful
benchmarks for the development of new techniques to simulate the transient

functions is needed because many electronic processes occur in excited states.
But since the excited energies are saddle points in the Hilbert space of wave
functions, the standard computational methods, based on orthogonality to lower
lying approximants, resort to huge and incomprehensible wave functions,
otherwise, the truncated wave function is veered away from the exact. The
presented variational principle for excited states, Fn, is demonstrated to lead
to the correct excited eigenfunction in necessarily small truncated spaces.
Using Hylleraas coordinates for He 1S 1s2s, the standard method based on the
theorem of Hylleraas - Unheim, and MacDonald, yields misleading main orbitals
1s1s' and needs a series expansion of 27 terms to be corrected, whereas
minimizing Fn goes directly to the corect main orbitals, 1s2s, and can be
adequately improved by 8 terms. Fn uses crude, rather inaccurate, lower lying
approximants and does not need orthogonality to them. This reduces
significantly the computation cost. Thus, having a correct 1st excited state
{\psi}1, a ground state approximant can be immediately improved toward an
orthogonal to psi_1 function. Also higher lying functions can be found that
have the energy of psi_1, but are orthogonal to psi_1. Fn can also recognize a
flipped root in avoided crossings: The excited state, either flipped or not,
has the smallest Fn. Thus, state average is unnecessary. The method is further
applied via conventional configuration interaction to the three lowest singlet
states of He 1S.

Hamiltonian with spin-orbit coupling included of a spin one-half particle in
electromagnetic fields that are confined to a curved surface embedded in a
three-dimensional space spanned by a general Orthogonal Curvilinear Coordinate

squeezing the particle to the surface by a potential, then it is the physical
gauge-covariant kinematical momentum operator (velocity operator) transverse to
the surface that should be dropped from the Hamiltonian(s). In both cases,the
resulting Hermitian gauge-invariant Hamiltonian on the surface is free from any
reference to the component of the vector potential transverse to the surface,
and the approach is completely gauge-independent. In particular, for the Pauli
Hamiltonian these results are obtained exactly without any further assumptions

  Formulation of Systems with Spin-Orbit Coupling</title><description>  The question of gauge-covariance in the non-Abelian gauge-field formulation
of two space-dimensional systems with spin-orbit coupling relevant to
spintronics is investigated. Although, these are generally gauge-fixed models,
it is found that for the class of gauge fields that are space-time independent
and satisfy a U(1) algebra, thus having a vanishing field strength, there is a
residual gauge freedom in the Hamiltonian. The gauge transformations assume the
form of a space-dependent rotation of the transformed wave functions with
rotation angles and axes determined by the specific form of the gauge-field,
i.e., the spin-orbit coupling. The fields can be gauged away, reducing the
Hamiltonian to one which is isospectral to the free-particle Hamiltonian, and
giving rise to the phenomenon of persistent spin helix reported first by
B.~A.~Bernevig \emph{et al.} [Phys.~Rev.~Lett. \textbf{97}, 236601 (2006)]. The
investigation of the global gauge transformations leads to the derivation of a
continuity equation where the component of the spin-density along given
directions, again fixed by the specific form of the gauge field, is conserved.

challenge for quantum communications [1-8]. Particularly promising in this
context are the N00N states, which are entangled N-photon wavepackets
delocalized between two different locations, providing measurement sensitivity
limited only by the uncertainty principle [1, 10-15]. However, these states are
notoriously vulnerable to losses, making it difficult both to share them
between remote locations, and to recombine them to exploit interference
effects. Here we address this challenge by utilizing the reverse version of the
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect [16] to prepare a high-fidelity two-photon N00N state
shared between two parties connected by a lossy optical channel. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the enhanced phase sensitivity can be directly exploited in
the two distant locations, and we remotely prepare superpositions of coherent
states, known as Schr\&quot;odinger's cat states&quot; [17, 18].

are generally finite, even in the thermodynamic limit, when the entirety
$S$$+$$E$ is at finite temperature. Notably, applying perturbation theory with
respect to the system-environment coupling strength, we find that under common
Hamiltonian symmetries, up to first order in the coupling strength it is
sufficient to consider $S$ uncoupled from $E$, but entangled with $E$, to
predict decoherence and thermalization measures of $S$. This decoupling allows
closed form expressions for perturbative expansions for the measures of
decoherence and thermalization in terms of the free energies of $S$ and of $E$.
Large-scale numerical results for both coupled and uncoupled entireties with up

closed systems, we study the classical limit of coarse-grained spacetime
histories and their decoherence. The system under consideration is
one-dimensional and consists of a particle coupled to a von Neumann apparatus
that performs a measurement of the position of the particle during the finite
time interval during which the histories of this system take place. We consider
two cases: a free particle and a harmonic oscillator. The real line is divided
into intervals of the same length, and coarse-grained histories are defined by
the time average of the position of the particle on a given Feynman path to be
within one of these intervals. The position of the pointer in each Feynman path
correlates with this time average. The class operators for this system have
been evaluated, and the decoherence functional shows that these coarse-grained
histories do not decohere, not even when initially either the particle or the
pointer is in an eigenstate of position. Decoherence is obtained only when the
classical limit is taken. Qualitative arguments for decoherence in the
classical limit are presented for the case of a general particle potential.

implementation of such protocols requires an efficient quantum memory with long
coherence time. Beating the no-cloning limit, for example, requires
efficiencies above 50\%. An ideal optical fibre loop has a loss of 50% in 100
$\mu$ s, and until now no universal quantum memory has beaten this
time-efficiency limit. Here, we report results of a gradient echo memory (GEM)

maximum efficiency up to 87$\pm$2% for short storage times. Our experimental

Quantum storage ability is verified beyond the ideal fibre limit using

ergodic dynamics, assuming full access to the output state for arbitrarily long

are orbits of a Lie group acting on the space of dynamical parameters. Second,
we define an information geometric structure on this space, including a
principal bundle given by the action of the group, as well as a compatible
connection, and a Riemannian metric based on the quantum Fisher information of
the output. We compute the metric explicitly in terms of the Markov covariance
of certain &quot;fluctuation operators&quot;, and relate it to the horizontal bundle of
the connection. Third, we show that the system-output and reduced output state
satisfy local asymptotic normality, i.e. they can be approximated by a Gaussian

constructed from the Markov covariance &quot;data&quot;. We illustrate the result by
working out the details of the information geometry of a physically relevant
two-level system.

statement expresses the dominant way of thinking in physics: Physics is about
the impersonal laws of nature; the &quot;I&quot; never makes an appearance in it. Since
the advent of quantum theory, however, there has always been a nagging pressure
to insert a first-person perspective into the heart of physics. In incarnations
of lesser or greater strength, one may consider the &quot;Copenhagen&quot; views of Bohr,
Heisenberg, and Pauli, the observer-participator view of John Wheeler, the
informational interpretation of Anton Zeilinger and Caslav Brukner, the
relational interpretation of Carlo Rovelli, and, most radically, the QBism of
N. David Mermin, Ruediger Schack, and the present author, as acceding to the
pressure. These views have lately been termed &quot;participatory realism&quot; to
emphasize that rather than relinquishing the idea of reality (as they are often
accused of), they are saying that reality is more than any third-person
perspective can capture. Thus, far from instances of instrumentalism or
antirealism, these views of quantum theory should be regarded as attempts to
make a deep statement about the nature of reality. This paper explicates the
idea for the case of QBism. As well, it highlights the influence of John

results and insights into archetypal many-body problems, including quantum
phase transitions. Still, the question whether out-of-equilibrium quantities,
such as fluctuations of work, exhibit critical scaling after a sudden quench in
a closed system has remained elusive. Here, we take a novel approach to the
problem by studying a quench across an impurity quantum critical point. By
performing density matrix renormalization group computations on the
two-impurity Kondo model, we are able to establish that the irreversible work
produced in a quench exhibits finite-size scaling at quantum criticality. This
scaling faithfully predicts the equilibrium critical exponents for the
crossover length and the order parameter of the model, and, moreover, implies a
new exponent for the rescaled irreversible work. By connecting the irreversible
work to the two-impurity spin correlation function, our findings can be tested
experimentally.

not only provided new insights into the nature of non-local spatial
correlations in quantum mechanics, but also serves as a resource for one-sided
device-independent quantum information tasks. Here, we investigate how EPR
steering behaves when one-half of a maximally-entangled pair of qudits
(multidimensional quantum systems) is cloned by a universal cloning machine. We
find that EPR steering, as verified by a criterion based on the mutual
information between qudits, can only be found in one of the copy subsystems but
not both. We prove that this is also true for the single-system analogue of EPR
steering. We find that this restriction, which we term &quot;no-cloning of quantum
steering&quot;, elucidates the physical reason why steering can be used to secure
sources and channels against cloning-based attacks when implementing quantum

Floquet topological phases, here we propose a scheme to engineer
large-Chern-number phases with ease by periodic quenching. Using a two-band
system as an example, we theoretically show how a variety of topological phases
with widely tunable Chern numbers can be generated by periodic quenching
between two simple Hamiltonians that otherwise give low Chern numbers. The
obtained large Chern numbers are explained through the emergence of multiple
Dirac cones in the Floquet spectra. The transition lines between different
topological phases in the two-band model are also explicitly found, thus
establishing a class of easily solvable but very rich systems useful for
further understandings and applications of topological phases in periodically

the entanglement of a given initial three-qubit state which is governed by
hamiltonian of a three-spin Ising chain in site-dependent transverse fields. We
show that according to anti-symmetric property of the hamiltonian with respect
to some operators mimicking the time reversal operator, the dynamics of the
system can be effectively reversed. It equips us to control the dynamics of the
system. The control procedure is implemented as a sequence of cyclic evolution;
accordingly the entanglement of the system is protected for any given initial
state with any desired accuracy an long-time. Using this approach we could
control not only the multiparty entanglement but also the pairwise
entanglement. It is also notable that in this paper although we restrict
ourselves mostly within a three-spin Ising chain in site-dependent transverse

precision with given resources and design schemes that attain that precision.
Two schemes, the sequential feedback scheme and the parallel scheme, are
usually considered in quantum parameter estimation, although the sequential
feedback scheme is more general, it remained unclear whether it can ever
outperform the parallel scheme for any practical quantum parameter estimation
tasks. In this article we study the problem of simultaneously estimating all
three components of a magnetic field, which is a key problem in quantum
parameter estimation. We show that, contrary to the conventional belief, it is
possible to simultaneously achieve the highest precision in estimating all
three parameters of a magnetic field. The precision is obtained by optimizing
all steps of the estimation procedure, thus represents the ultimate precision
for estimating all components of a magnetic field. Our results also show that
the sequential feedback scheme can outperform the parallel scheme in quantum
parameter estimation which sheds light on the comparison between these two
schemes.

for two-particle Hermitian operators constructed in terms of Schwinger
operators, and study its role in detecting entanglement in a two-particle
state: the violation of the uncertainty relation for a partially transposed
state implies that the original state is entangled. This generalizes a result
obtained for continuous-variable systems to the discrete-variable-system case.
This is significant because testing entanglement in terms of an uncertainty
relation has a physically appealing interpretation. We study the case of a
Werner state, which is a mixed state constructed as a convex combination with a
parameter $r$ of a Bell state $|\Phi^{+} \rangle$ and the completely incoherent

signaling must fail in this and in similar cases, often citing consistency with
relativity as the justification. I argue that this objection fails to rule out
nonlocal signaling in the presence of a CTC. I argue that the reason these
authors are motivated to exclude the prediction of nonlocal signaling is
because the No Signaling principle is considered to a fundamental part of the
formulation of the quantum information approach. I draw out the relationship
between nonlocal signaling, quantum information, and relativity, and argue that
the principle theory formulation of quantum mechanics, which is at the
foundation of the quantum information approach, is in tension with foundational
assumptions of Deutsch's D-CTC model, on which this protocol is based.

  Perturbation</title><description>  A number of recent studies have investigated the introduction of decoherence
in quantum walks and the resulting transition to classical random walks.
Interestingly, it has been shown that algorithmic properties of quantum walks
with decoherence such as the spreading rate are sometimes better than their
purely quantum counterparts. Not only quantum walks with decoherence provide a
generalization of quantum walks that naturally encompasses both the quantum and
classical case, but they also give rise to new and different probability
distribution. The application of quantum walks with decoherence to large graphs
is limited by the necessity of evolving a state vector whose size is quadratic
in the number of nodes of the graph, as opposed to the linear state vector of
the purely quantum (or classical) case. In this technical report, we show how
to use perturbation theory to reduce the computational complexity of evolving a
continuous-time quantum walk subject to decoherence. More specifically, given a
graph over n nodes, we show how to approximate the eigendecomposition of the
n^2 x n^2 Lindblad super-operator from the eigendecomposition of the n x n
graph Hamiltonian.

  using a 7-qubit quantum simulator</title><description>  Anyons, quasiparticles living in two-dimensional spaces with exotic exchange
statistics, can serve as the fundamental units for fault-tolerant quantum
computation. However, experimentally demonstrating anyonic statistics is a
challenge due to the technical limitations of current experimental platforms.
Here, we take a state perpetration approach to mimic anyons in the Kitaev
lattice model using a 7-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum simulator.
Anyons are created by dynamically preparing the ground and excited states of
the 7-qubit Kitaev lattice model, and are subsequently braided along two
distinct, but topologically equivalent, paths. We observe that the phase
acquired by the anyons is independent of the path, and coincides with the ideal
theoretical predictions when decoherence and implementation errors are taken
into account. As the first demonstration of the topological path independence
of anyons, our experiment helps to study and exploit the anyonic properties
towards the goal of building a topological quantum computer.

  Complementarity between separable and maximally entangled states</title><description>  Modern applications in quantum computation and quantum communication require
the precise characterization of quantum states and quantum channels. In
practice, this means that one has to determine the quantum capacity of a
physical system in terms of measurable quantities. Witnesses, if properly
constructed, succeed in performing this task. We derive a method that is
capable to compute witnesses for identifying deterministic evolutions and
measurement-induced collapse processes. At the same time, applying the
Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, it uncovers the entanglement characteristics of
bipartite quantum states. Remarkably, a statistical mixture of unitary
evolutions is mapped onto mixtures of maximally entangled states, and classical
separable states originate from genuine quantum-state reduction maps. Based on
our treatment we are able to witness these opposing attributes at once and,
furthermore, obtain an insight into their different geometric structures. The
complementarity is further underpinned by formulating a complementary Schmidt
decomposition of a state in terms of maximally entangled states and discrete
Fourier-transformed Schmidt coefficients.

  Weyl, Dirac and Maxwell quantum cellular automata</title><description>  After leading to a new axiomatic derivation of quantum theory, the new
informational paradigm is entering the domain of quantum field theory,
suggesting a quantum automata framework that can be regarded as an extension of
quantum field theory to including an hypothetical Planck scale, and with the
usual quantum field theory recovered in the relativistic limit of small
wave-vectors. Being derived from simple principles (linearity, unitarity,
locality, homogeneity, isotropy, and minimality of dimension), the automata
theory is quantum ab-initio, and does not assume Lorentz covariance and
mechanical notions. Being discrete it can describe localized states and
measurements (unmanageable by quantum field theory), solving all the issues
plaguing field theory originated from the continuum. These features make the
theory an ideal framework for quantum gravity, with relativistic covariance and
space-time emergent solely from the interactions, and not assumed a priori. The
paper presents a synthetic derivation of the automata theory, showing how from
the principles lead to a description in terms of a quantum automaton over a
Cayley graph of a group. Restricting to Abelian groups we show how the automata
recover the Weyl, Dirac and Maxwell dynamics in the relativistic limit. We
conclude with some new routes about the more general scenario of non-Abelian
Cayley graphs.

quantum cellular automata (QCA) theory follows, whose relativistic limit of
small wave-vector provides the free dynamics of quantum field theory. The QCA
theory can be regarded as an extended quantum field theory that describes in a

the usual Fermi scale. The present paper reviews the elementary automaton

terms of a dispersive differential equation for narrowband wave-packets, and
some account on the position space description in terms of a discrete

subject to a uniform magnetic field. The electric dipole-dipole interaction
between the molecules creates entangled pair-eigenstates of two types. In one
type, the Zeeman interaction between the inherently paramagnetic molecules and
the magnetic field destroys the entanglement of the pair-eigenstates, whereas
in the other type it does not. The pair-eigenstates exhibit numerous
intersections, which become avoided for pair-eigenstates comprised of
individual states that meet the selection rules $\Delta J_{i}=0,\pm 1$, $\Delta
N_{i}=0,\pm 2$, and $\Delta M_{i}=0,\pm 1$ imposed by the electric
dipole-dipole operator. Here $J_{i}$, $N_{i}$ and $M_{i}$ are the total,
rotational and projection angular momentum quantum numbers of molecules $i=1,2$
in the absence of the electric dipole-dipole interaction. We evaluate the
mutual alignment of the pair-eigenstates and find it to be independent of the
magnetic field, except for states that undergo avoided crossings, in which case
the alignment of the interacting states is interchanged at the magnetic field
corresponding to the crossing point. We present an analytic model which

a prominent example particles can spontaneously form stationary periodic
configurations which simultaneously maximize the light scattering and minimize
the atomic potential energy in the emerging optical lattice. Such self-ordering
effects resulting in periodic lattices via bimodal symmetry breaking have been
experimentally observed with cold gases and Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs)
inside an optical resonator. Here we study a new regime of periodic pattern
formation for an atomic BEC in free space, driven by far off-resonant
counterpropagating and non-interfering lasers of orthogonal polarization. In
contrast to previous works, no spatial light modes are preselected by any
boundary conditions and the transition from homogeneous to periodic order
amounts to a crystallization of both light and ultracold atoms breaking a
continuous translational symmetry. In the crystallized state the BEC acquires a
phase similar to a supersolid with an emergent intrinsic length scale whereas
the light-field forms an optical lattice allowing phononic excitations via
collective back scattering, which are gapped due to the infinte-range
interactions. The studied system constitutes a novel configuration allowing the
simulation of synthetic solid state systems with ultracold atoms including
long-range phonon dynamics.

provides a conceptually motivated procedure to compute the meaning of
sentences, given grammatical structure and the meanings of its words. This
approach has outperformed other models in mainstream empirical language
processing tasks. However, until recently it has lacked the crucial feature of
lexical entailment -- as do other distributional models of meaning.
  In this paper we solve the problem of entailment for categorical
compositional distributional semantics. Taking advantage of the abstract
categorical framework allows us to vary our choice of model. This enables the
introduction of a notion of entailment, exploiting ideas from the categorical
semantics of partial knowledge in quantum computation.
  The new model of language uses density matrices, on which we introduce a
novel robust graded order capturing the entailment strength between concepts.
This graded measure emerges from a general framework for approximate
entailment, induced by any commutative monoid. Quantum logic embeds in our
graded order.
  Our main theorem shows that entailment strength lifts compositionally to the
sentence level, giving a lower bound on sentence entailment. We describe the
essential properties of graded entailment such as continuity, and provide a
procedure for calculating entailment strength.

accompanied by a reliable means to characterize the efficiency of that process
is needed in the study of correlated photon pairs and entangled states
involving more than three photons, which have important potential applications
in quantum information and quantum communication. In this study, we report the
first characterization of the efficiency of generation of correlated photon
pairs emitted from a CuCl single crystal using the biexciton-resonance
hyper-parametric scattering (RHPS) method which is the highly efficient method
of generation of correlated photon pairs. In order to characterize the
generation efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio of correlated photon pairs
using this method, we investigated the excitation density dependence on the
photon counting rate and coincidence counting rate under resonant excitation.
The excitation density dependence shows that the power characteristics of the
photon counting rates changes from linear to quadratic dependence of the
excitation density. This behavior represents a superposition of contributions
from correlated photon pairs and non-correlated photons. Photon counting
signals in this study were recorded as time-tag data, which provide the photon
counting rate and coincidence counting rate simultaneously, and improve the
coincidence counting rate by the factor of 200 compared to that obtained in
previous work [K. Edamatsu $\it{et\ al}$. Nature $\bf{431}$, 167-170 (2004)].
The analysis of the excitation density dependence shows that one photon-pair is
produced by a pump pulse with $2 \times 10^6$ photons. Moreover, the generation
efficiency of this method is improved by a factor of $10^7$ compared to that of
several methods based on the $\chi^{(3)}$ parametric process.

quantum circuits (SQCs), because the Rabi frequency of the strong controlling
field corresponding to EIT is limited by the decay rates of the SQCs. Here, we
show that EIT can be achieved by engineering decay rates in a superconducting
circuit QED system through a classical driving field on the qubit. Without such
a driving field, the superconducting qubit and the cavity field are
approximately decoupled in the large detuning regime, and thus the eigenstates
of the system are approximately product states of the cavity field and qubit
states. However, the driving field can strongly mix these product states and
so-called polariton states can be formed. The weights of the states for the
qubit and cavity field in the polariton states can be tuned by the driving
field, and thus the decay rates of the polariton states can be changed. We

  measurement perspective</title><description>  The purpose of the present note is twofold. Firstly, we highlight the
similarities between the ontologies of Kastner's possibilist transactional
interpretation (PTI) of quantum mechanics - an extension of Cramer's
transactional interpretation - and the authors' hidden-measurement
interpretation (HMI). Secondly, we observe that although a weighted symmetry
breaking (WSB) process was proposed in the PTI, to explain the actualization of
incipient transactions, no specific mechanism was actually provided to explain
why the weights of such symmetry breaking are precisely those given by the Born
rule. In other terms, PTI, similarly to decoherence theory, doesn't explain a
quantum measurement in a complete way, but just the transition from a pure
state to a fully reduced density matrix state. On the other hand, the recently
derived extended Bloch representation (EBR) - a specific implementation the HMI
- precisely provides such missing piece of explanation, i.e., a qualitative
description of the WSB as a process of actualization of hidden
measurement-interactions and, more importantly, a quantitative prediction of
the values of the associated weights that is compatible with the Born rule of
probabilistic assignment. Therefore, from the PTI viewpoint, the EBR provide
the missing link for a complete description of a quantum measurement. However,
EBR is in a sense more general than PTI, as it does not rely on the specific
notion of transaction, and therefore remains compatible with other physical
mechanisms that could be at the origin of the measurement-interactions.

proposals for realizing effective TACT transformed from OAT require stringent

theoretic ideas with an accurate quantum-mechanical description of reality to
give a more accurate and complete theory with new and more powerful
possibilities for information processing. The goal of both classical and
quantum information theory is to quantify the optimal rates of interconversion
of different resources. These rates are usually characterized in terms of
entropies. However, nonadditivity of many entropic formulas often makes finding
answers to information theoretic questions intractable. In a few auspicious
cases, such as the classical capacity of a classical channel, the capacity
region of a multiple access channel and the entanglement assisted capacity of a
quantum channel, additivity allows a full characterization of optimal rates.
Here we present a new mathematical property of entropic formulas, uniform
additivity, that is both easily evaluated and rich enough to capture all known
quantum additive formulas. We give a complete characterization of uniformly
additive functions using the linear programming approach to entropy
inequalities. In addition to all known quantum formulas, we find a new and

uncover a remarkable coincidence---the classical and quantum uniformly additive

  In symmetric quantum dots, one of the dark exciton eigenstate is totally dark

polarized along the symmetry axis (growth direction) of the quantum dot. In
non-symmetric quantum dots, the two dark excitons' eigenstates are mixed with
the bright excitons' eigenstates which have cross-linearly polarized
perpendicular to the growth direction dipole moments. As a result of this

potential to revolutionize quantum technologies by speeding up the time
evolution while mimicking adiabatic dynamics. These nonadiabatic protocols can

The outer bounds match the inner bounds in the infinite-energy limit, thereby

arises due to phase of the periodic force experienced by the oscillator due to
the relative motion of the lattice.

the quantized motion of an electron in a magnetic field and in a dissipative
environment. It is established from first principles that the quantum work
operator W has a Gaussian distribution even though the system under

dynamics and has characteristic quantum features, especially at low

have been intensely studied due to their exceptionally long coherence times.
More recently bismuth donor electron spins have become popular because Bi has a
large nuclear spin which gives rise to clock transitions (first-order
insensitive to magnetic field noise). At every clock transition there are two
nearly degenerate transitions between four distinct states which can be used as
a pair of qubits. Here it is experimentally demonstrated that these transitions
are excited by microwaves of opposite helicity such that they can be
selectively driven by varying microwave polarization. This work uses a
combination of a superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) microresonator and a

single atoms introduces optical non-linearities for which nontrivial
interference phenomena are predicted. Their observation, however, has been
hampered by difficulties in preparing the required atomic distribution,
controlling the optical phases and detecting the faint light. Here we overcome
all of these experimental challenges by combining an optical lattice for atom

resonance fluorescence for constructive interference of the scattered light and
nonzero emission with huge photon bunching for destructive interference. The
latter is explained by atomic saturation and photon pair generation. Our
experimental setting is scalable and allows one to realize the Tavis-Cummings

these three relations can be seen as the quasi-classical limit of three fully

Previous works have addressed the probabilities involved in these measurements

enhancements can be obtained with mode-separable states and local measurements.
The crucial resource for quantum enhancement is shown to be a large number
variance in the probe state, which can be obtained without any entanglement
between the modes. This has important practical implications because local
strategies using separable states have many advantages over global schemes
using multi-mode-entangled states. Such advantages include a robustness to
local estimation failure, more flexibility in the distribution of resources,
and comparatively easier state preparation. We obtain our results by analyzing
two different schemes: the first uses a set of interferometers, which can be
used as a model for a network of quantum sensors, and the second looks at
measuring a number of phases relative to a reference, which is concerned

optically induced 13 C nuclear spin hyperpolarisation in diamond at room

tomography based on strong or weak measurements carried out on an ensemble of
identically prepared systems. By contrast, the use of protective measurements
offers the possibility of determining quantum states from a series of weak,
long measurements performed on a single system. Because the fidelity of a
protectively measured quantum state is determined by the amount of state
disturbance incurred during each protective measurement, it is crucial that the
initial quantum state of the system is disturbed as little as possible. Here we
show how to systematically minimize the state disturbance in the course of a
protective measurement, thus enabling the maximization of the fidelity of the
quantum-state measurement. Our approach is based on a careful tuning of the
time dependence of the measurement interaction and is shown to be dramatically
more effective in reducing the state disturbance than the previously considered
strategy of weakening the measurement strength and increasing the measurement
time. We describe a method for designing the measurement interaction such that
the state disturbance exhibits polynomial decay to arbitrary order in the
inverse measurement time $1/T$. We also show how one can achieve even faster,
subexponential decay, and we find that it represents the smallest possible
state disturbance in a protective measurement. In this way, our results show
how to optimally measure the state of a single quantum system using protective

Schr\&quot;odinger equation in the presence of the earth's gravitational field.
Transitions between energy levels are induced by an oscillating driving force
of frequency $\omega$. The driving force is created by oscillating a
macroscopic mass in the neighbourhood of the system of neutrons. The neutrons
decay in 880 seconds while the probability of transitions increase as $t^2$.
Hence the optimal strategy is to drive the system for 2 lifetimes. The
transition amplitude then is of the order of $1.06\times 10^{-5}$ hence with a
million ultra cold neutrons, one should be able to observe transitions.

  Field</title><description>  Randomness is an indispensable resource in modern science and information
technology. Fortunately, an experimentally simple procedure exists to generate
randomness with well-characterized devices: measuring a quantum system in a
basis complementary to its preparation. Towards realizing this goal one may
consider using atoms or superconducting qubits, promising candidates for
quantum information processing. However, their unavoidable interaction with the
electromagnetic field affects their dynamics. At large time scales, this can
result in decoherence. Smaller time scales in principle avoid this problem, but
may not be well analysed under the usual rotating wave and single-mode
approximation (RWA and SMA) which break the relativistic nature of quantum
field theory. Here, we use a fully relativistic analysis to quantify the
information that an adversary with access to the field could get on the result
of an atomic measurement. Surprisingly, we find that the adversary's guessing
probability is not minimized for atoms initially prepared in the ground state
(an intuition derived from the RWA and SMA model).

proposed a method to evaluate pure quantum contributions from total statistical
characteristics of two coupled oscillators interacting with thermal reservoirs.
The natural way to extract pure quantum characteristic of the system under
study is a calculation of difference between the total value and its pure
classical part. A numerical study of temporal behavior of quantum variances and
covariances from given initial states up to states in the infinite time limit
is given using the proposed method. It is shown that at comparatively high
temperatures the steady state total variances are almost classical, because
their pure quantum parts tend to zero in this regime. Otherwise, at
comparatively low temperatures, the pure quantum parts of variances are not
zeroing in steady states manifesting a finite contribution to total values. The
same is true for the covariance. The larger the temperature, the lower is the
quantum contribution to the total covariance. As well as entanglement measures,
quantum discord, the pure quantum contributions in the covariance matrix
elements are important characteristics of the temporal dynamics of complex
quantum systems.

very expensive in terms of the number of gates required, although individual

no-signaling adversaries has so far been studied under the assumption that the
weak source of randomness is uncorrelated with the (quantum) devices used in
the amplification procedure. In this work, we relax this assumption, and
reconsider the original protocol of Colbeck and Renner, Nature Physics 8,
450-454 (2012), on randomness amplification using a Santha-Vazirani (SV)
source. To do so, we introduce an SV-like condition for devices, namely that
any string of SV source bits remains weakly random conditioned upon any other
bit string from the same SV source and the outputs obtained when this further
string is input into the devices. Assuming this condition, we show that a
quantum device using a singlet state to violate the chained Bell inequalities
leads to full randomness in the asymptotic scenario of a large number of
settings, for a restricted set of SV sources (with $0 \leq \varepsilon &lt;
\frac{(2^{(1/12)} - 1)}{2(2^{(1/12)} + 1)} \approx 0.0144$). We also study a
device-independent protocol that allows for correlations between the sequence
of boxes used in the protocol and the SV source bits used to choose the
particular box from whose output the randomness is obtained. Assuming the
SV-like condition for devices, we show that the honest parties can achieve
amplification of the weak source against this attack for the parameter range $0
\leq \varepsilon&lt;0.0132$. We leave the case of a yet more general attack on the
amplification protocol as an interesting open problem.

many-body systems, it seems that there is not a one-to-one correspondence
between topological phases and quantum phases. As a well-known example, it has
been shown that all one-dimensional (1D) quantum phases are topologically
trivial\cite{spt}. By such a fact, it seems a challenging task to understand
when a quantum phase transition between different topological models
necessarily reveals different topological classes of them. In this paper, we
make an attempt to consider this problem by studying a phase transition between
two different quantum phases which belong to a universal topological phase. We
define a Hamiltonian which describes an interpolation between the toric code
model with $Z_2$ topological order and the color code model with $Z_2 \times
Z_2$ topological order on a hexagonal lattice. We show such a model is exactly
mapped to many copies of 1D quantum Ising model in transverse field by
rewriting the Hamiltonian in a new complete basis. Consequently, we show that
the universal topological phase of the color code model and the toric code
model reflects in the 1D nature of the phase transition. We also consider the
expectation value of Wilson loops by a perturbative calculation and show that
behavior of the Wilson loop captures the non-topological nature of the quantum
phase transition. The result on the point of phase transition also show that
the color code model is strongly robust against the toric code model.

order allows for quantum processes in which operations in local laboratories
are neither causally ordered nor in a probabilistic mixture of definite causal
orders. The causal relation between the laboratories is described by the
process matrix. We show that, if the inputs of the laboratories are measured in
a fixed basis, one can introduce an effective process matrix which is
operationally indistinguishable from the original one. This effective process
matrix can be obtained by applying the von Neumann- Lu\&quot;ders update rule for
nonselective measurements to the original process matrix and in the bipartite
case it is compatible with a definite causal order. The latter extends the
original Oreshkov et al. proof where one considers that both the measurement of
the input and the re-preparation of the output are performed in a fixed basis.

the system evolution is constrained to states commensurate with the measurement

that represent real objects with noisy data. To account for noise, we relax the
definition of similarity using the maximum weighted co-$k$-plex relaxation
method, which allows dissimilarities among graphs up to a predetermined level.
We then formulate the problem as a novel quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization problem that can be solved by a quantum annealer. The context of
our study is molecular similarity where the presence of noise might be due to
regular errors in measuring molecular features. We develop a similarity measure
and use it to predict the mutagenicity of a molecule. Our results indicate that
the relaxed similarity measure, designed to accommodate the regular errors,
yields a higher prediction accuracy than the measure that ignores the noise.

general family of self-adjoint Hamiltonians which are quantum mechanically
equivalent to the non self-adjoint proposed ones. Inspired in the probability
density of the problem, we construct an ansatz for the solutions of the family
of self-adjoint Hamiltonians. We use this ansatz to map the solutions of the
time independent Schrodinger equations generated by the non self-adjoint
Hamiltonians into the Hilbert space of the solutions of the respective dual
self-adjoint Hamiltonians. This mapping depends on both the position-dependent

existence of a consistent continuity equation. We identify the non self-adjoint
Hamiltonians here studied to a very general family of Hamiltonians proposed in
a seminal article of Harrison [1] to describe varying band structures in
different types of metals. Therefore, we have self-adjoint Hamiltonians that
correspond to the non self-adjoint ones found in Harrison's article. We analyze
three typical cases by choosing a physical position-dependent mass and a
deformed harmonic oscillator potential . We completely solve the Schrodinger

  Heisenberg-limited displacement sensing</title><description>  Placing a nanomechanical object in the evanescent near-field of a high-$Q$
optical microcavity gives access to strong gradient forces and
quantum-noise-limited displacement readout, offering an attractive platform for
precision sensing technology and basic quantum optics research. Robustly
implementing this platform is challenging, however, as it requires separating
optically smooth surfaces by $\lesssim\lambda/10$. Here we describe a
fully-integrated evanescent opto-nanomechanical transducer based on a
high-stress Si$_3$N$_4$ nanobeam monolithically suspended above a SiO$_2$
microdisk cavity. Employing a novel vertical integration technique based on
planarized sacrificial layers, we achieve beam-disk gaps as little as 25 nm
while maintaining mechanical $Q\times f&gt;10^{12}$ Hz and intrinsic optical
$Q\sim10^7$. The combined low loss, small gap, and parallel-plane geometry
result in exceptionally efficient transduction, characterizing by
radio-frequency flexural modes with vacuum optomechanical coupling rates of 100
kHz, single-photon cooperativities in excess of unity, and zero-point frequency
(displacement) noise amplitudes of 10 kHz (fm)/$\surd$Hz. In conjunction with
the high power handling capacity of SiO$_2$ and low extraneous substrate noise,
the transducer operates particularly well as a sensor. Deploying it in a 4 K
cryostat, we recently demonstrated a displacement imprecision 40 dB below that
at the standard quantum limit (SQL) with an imprecision-back-action product
$&lt;5\cdot\hbar$. In this report we provide a comprehensive description of device
design, fabrication, and characterization, with an emphasis on extending
Heisenberg-limited readout to room temperature. Towards this end, we describe a
room temperature experiment in which a displacement imprecision 30 dB below
that at the SQL and an imprecision-back-action product $&lt;75\cdot\hbar$ is

to solve common tasks without the need for mutual trust. Examples of such tasks
are private access to a database, and secure identification. Quantum
communication enables security for all of these problems in the noisy-storage
model by sending more signals than the adversary can store in a certain time
frame. Here, we initiate the study of device-independent protocols for
two-party cryptography in the noisy-storage model. Specifically, we present a
relatively easy to implement protocol for a cryptographic building block known
as weak string erasure and prove its security even if the devices used in the
protocol are prepared by the dishonest party. Device-independent two-party
cryptography is made challenging by the fact that Alice and Bob do not trust
each other, which requires new techniques to establish security. We fully
analyse the case of memoryless devices (for which sequential attacks are
optimal) and the case of sequential attacks for arbitrary devices. The key
ingredient of the proof, which might be of independent interest, is an explicit
(and tight) relation between the violation of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality observed by Alice and Bob and uncertainty generated by Alice against
Bob who is forced to measure his system before finding out Alice's setting
(guessing with postmeasurement information). In particular, we show that
security is possible for arbitrarily small violation.

of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities, Glauber-Sudarshan P-nonclassicality,
sub-Poissonian number-difference squeezing (also known as the two-mode

We conclude that to date in experiments relevant for analogue gravity,

lossy-noisy bosonic (quantum) channels with a quantum-limited adversary. The
key import of these results was the square-root law (SRL) for covert
communication, which states that $O(\sqrt{n})$ covert bits, but no more, can be
reliably transmitted over $n$ channel uses with $O(\sqrt{n})$ bits of secret
pre-shared between communicating parties. Here we prove the achievability of
the SRL for a general memoryless classical-quantum channel, showing that SRL
covert communication is achievable over any quantum communication channel with
a product-state transmission strategy. We leave open the converse, which, if
proven, would show that even using entangled transmissions and entangling

an impediment to quantum-limited measurement in systems ranging from microwave

smaller dimensions, extrinsic system properties can affect its internal
material dynamics. In this paper, we identify surprising new regimes of
material physics (defect-phonon and defect-defect dynamics) that are produced
by dimensional confinement. Our models show that a range of tell-tale
signatures, encoded in the characteristics of defect-induced noise,
dissipation, and nonlinearity, are profoundly altered by geometry. Building on
this insight, we demonstrate that the magnitude and character of this
material-induced noise is transformed in microscale systems, providing an
opportunity to improve the fidelity of quantum measurements. Moreover, we show
that many emerging nano-electromechanical, cavity optomechanical and
superconducting resonator systems are poised to probe these new regimes of

no-signalling correlations has been studied recently. The one-shot
no-signalling assisted classical zero-error simulation cost of non-commutative
bipartite graphs has been formulated as semidefinite programms [Duan and
Winter, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 62, 891 (2016)]. Before our work, it was
unknown whether the one-shot (or asymptotic) no-signalling assisted zero-error
classical simulation cost for general non-commutative graphs is multiplicative
(resp. additive) or not. In this paper we address these issues and give a
general sufficient condition for the multiplicativity of the one-shot
simulation cost and the additivity of the asymptotic simulation cost of
non-commutative bipartite graphs, which include all known cases such as
extremal graphs and classical-quantum graphs. Applying this condition, we
exhibit a large class of so-called \emph{cheapest-full-rank graphs} whose
asymptotic zero-error simulation cost is given by the one-shot simulation cost.
Finally, we disprove the multiplicativity of one-shot simulation cost by
explicitly constructing a special class of qubit-qutrit non-commutative
bipartite graphs.

refracted and forward refracted beams, produced by the passage of neutrons
through one of the three plates of the LLL interferometer. Secondly, we analyze
their passage through a static magnetic field region. This allows us to find
explicit expressions for the intensities of the four beams exiting the

showing a neutron's phase change, when passing through the magnetic field, is
due to a longitudinal Stern-Gerlach effect, and not to a Larmor precession. We
also emphasize that these experiments do not prove the observability of the
sign change of the wave function, when a neutron is 2$\pi$ rotated, but
strongly indicate that the latter, like any other elementary &quot;particle,&quot; would

a cold ensemble of Rubidium atoms. We follow the DLCZ scheme to implement an
emissive quantum memory, which can be operated as a photon pair source with
controllable delay. We find that the temporal wave shape of the emitted read
photon can be precisely controlled by changing the shape of the driving read
pulse. We generate photons with temporal durations varying over three orders of
magnitude up to 10 {\mu}s without a significant change of the read-out
efficiency. We prove the non-classicality of the emitted photons by measuring
their antibunching, showing near single photon behavior at low excitation
probabilities. We also show that the photons are emitted in a pure state by
measuring unconditional autocorrelation functions. Finally, to demonstrate the
usability of the source for realistic applications, we create ultra-long single
photons with a rising exponential or doubly peaked wave shape which are
important for several quantum information tasks.

  Framework using Wiener-like Processes</title><description>  Wiener processes (the formalization of Brownian Motion random walk) provide a
basis for a model of discrete, mobile elements (Dx, Dy, Dz, Dt) that 'tile'
space-time. The possible migrations of these elements are shown graphically via
computer simulation. The Wiener process is modified by not taking the process
to infinitesimals, and by also allowing the process to be a random walk in time
as well as space. While migrations of a single element can easily be expressed
with such a Wiener-like process, migrations within the completely tiled
space-time (without introducing extra dimensions) require curvature. And since
the quantum vacuum energy fluctuations imply curvature fluctuations, we use
those curvature fluctuations in the model. The process of measurement, the
nature of particle spin, and the quantum mechanical implications of the model
are explored. The following results are obtained: In regions outside mass, the
Schwarzschild metric is deduced (using a plausibility argument) without
employing the General Relativity field equations. And inside mass, the model
gives the remarkable result that for spherical masses greater than the Planck
mass, there is no wave function, so, for example, the 2-slit experiment will
not (even theoretically) show interference when performed with cannonballs.

complicated coupling between multi-level systems. In this Letter, we solve this
problem by proposing a scalable circuit QED lattice with simple realization of
the universal set of non-adiabatic holonomic quantum computation. Compared with
existed proposals, here we can achieve both the single- and two- logical qubit
gates in an unprecedented tunable and all-resonant way through a hybrid
transmon-transmission-line encoding of the logical qubits in the

to information applications. In quantum information theory, from the postulates
of quantum mechanics it often has an intrinsic limitation, which then dictates
and also characterises capabilities of related information tasks. In this work,
we consider discrimination between bipartite two-qubit unitary transformations
by local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and its relations to
entangling capabilities of given unitaries. We show that a pair of entangling
unitaries which do not contain local parts, if they are perfectly
distinguishable by global operations, can also be perfectly distinguishable by
LOCC. There also exist non-entangling unitaries, e.g. local unitaries, that are
perfectly discriminated by global operations but not by LOCC. The results show
that capabilities of LOCC are strictly restricted than global operations in
distinguishing bipartite unitaries for a finite number of repetitions, contrast
to discrimination of a pair of bipartite states and also to asymptotic

telecommunication band is at the core of modern communication. Future quantum
information networks will require coherent microwave-to-optical conversion to
link electronic quantum processors and memories via low-loss optical
telecommunication networks. Efficient conversion can be achieved with
electro-optical modulators operating at the single microwave photon level. In
the standard electro-optic modulation scheme this is impossible because both,
up- and downconverted, sidebands are necessarily present. Here we demonstrate
true single sideband up- or downconversion in a triply resonant whispering
gallery mode resonator by explicitly addressing modes with asymmetric free
spectral range. Compared to previous experiments, we show a three orders of

0.1% photon number conversion for a 10GHz microwave tone at 0.42mW of optical

equations have been obtained for both electromagnetic and particle beams that
include Gouy phase. The solutions for particle beams correspond to those of the
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation in the non-relativistic limit. Here, distinct
canonical and kinetic 4-momentum operators will be defined for quantum
particles in matter wave beams. The kinetic momentum is equal to the canonical
momentum minus the fluctuating terms resulting from the transverse localization
of the beam. Three results are obtained. First, the total energy of a particle
for each beam mode is calculated. Second, the localization terms couple into
the canonical 4-momentum of the beam particles as a Lorentz covariant quantum
4-potential originating at the waist. The quantum 4-potential plays an
analogous role in relativistic Hamiltonian quantum mechanics to the Bohm
potential in the non-relativistic quantum Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Third, the
orbital angular momentum (OAM) operator must be defined in terms of canonical
momentum operators. It is further shown that kinetic 4-momentum does not
contribute to OAM indicating that OAM can therefore be regarded as a pure

relative properties of physical systems) then we can classify the properties of
a quantum system as either `external' or `internal', according to whether or
not they are affected by a change of the reference laboratory; the internal
properties are defined to be independent of the choice of reference frame. For
a system of quantum spins (qubits) the internal properties are typically
assumed to be all properties that are preserved under proper spatial rotations
of the laboratory apparatus, hence the associated symmetry group is SU(2).
However, this assumes that the laboratory itself is not entangled to the
system. One is therefore unable to account for the hypothetical possibility of
one laboratory becoming entangled to the system, as seen by a second laboratory
(a `Wigner's friend' scenario), in which case the relationship between the two
laboratories is not a rotation, but is fundamentally quantum. To overcome this
limitation, we propose that all observers should agree on how difficult it is
to distinguish different parts of a composite system from one another, hence
the fidelities between qubit subsystems should be preserved. By defining the
internal properties to be the fidelities, we re-derive SU(2) as the symmetry
group for N spins. We then consider a laboratory composed of qubits and include
it as part of the system. In that case, we find that the symmetry group of the
M-qubit joint system includes M-1 copies of the binary cyclic group Z(2). As a
consequence, in the absence of an external reference frame, a single spin in a
microscopic superposition relative to a large spin magnet is equivalent to a
macroscopic superposition of the magnet relative to the single spin. We discuss
the physical meaning of this result.

environment coupling is used as part of the state generation. In this work, we

We characterized the resulting states by performing quantum tomography,

subsequently transformed by a quantum channel representing the agent's memory,
while the outcomes of measurements performed at the channel's output determine
the agent's actions. The learning takes place via stepwise modifications of the

the projective simulation (PS) model and equipped with a glow mechanism that
allows for a backpropagation of policy changes, analogous to the eligibility

PS with the ability for generalization, offered by its physical embodiment as a

three-dimensional vector $\mathbf{a}$ and a metric tensor $\mathbf{\hat\Gamma}$
which satisfy $\mathbf{a}\cdot \mathbf{\hat\Gamma} \cdot \mathbf{a}\leq 1$.
This resembles the well known condition for qubit Bloch vectors in which case
$\mathbf{\hat\Gamma}=\hat{I}$. In our case the vector $\mathbf{a}$ corresponds
to spin-1 polarisation, whereas the tensor $\mathbf{\hat\Gamma}$ is a function
of polarisation uncertainties. Alternatively, $\mathbf{a}$ is a local Bloch
vector of a symmetric two-qubit state and $\mathbf{\hat\Gamma}$ is a function
of the corresponding correlation tensor. We also discuss how a purity of states

address (quasi)-steady states of this system that exhibit photonic currents
introduced by engineering driving and dissipation. We investigate two
approaches: in the first one, photonic currents arise as a consequence of a
phase difference of applied lasers and in the second one, photons are injected
locally and currents develop as they redistribute over the lattice. Effects of
interactions are taken into account within a mean-field framework. In the first
approach, we find that the current exhibits a resonant behavior with respect to
the driving frequency. Weak interactions shift the resonant frequency toward
higher values, while in the strongly interacting regime in our mean-field
treatment the effect stems from multiphotonic resonances of a single driven
cavity. For the second approach, we show that the overall lattice current can
be controlled by incorporating few cavities with stronger dissipation rates
into the system. These cavities serve as sinks for photonic currents and their
effect is maximal at the onset of quantum Zeno dynamics.

$\mathcal{H}_{a}\otimes\mathcal{H}_{b}$ with dimensions
$d_{a}=\dim\mathcal{H}_{a}$ and $d_{b}=\dim\mathcal{H}_{b}$ and for

parity state of a pair of Majorana bound states (MBS) using a tunnel coupled
quantum dot. The dot is coupled to one end of the topological wire but isolated
from any reservoir, and is capacitively coupled to a charge sensor for
measurement. The combined parity of the MBS-dot system is conserved and charge
transfer between the MBS and dot only occurs through resonant tunnelling.
Resonance is controlled by the dot potential through a local gate and by the
MBS splitting due to the overlap of the MBS pair wavefunctions. The latter
splitting can be tuned from zero (topologically protected regime) to a finite
value by bringing the spatially separated MBS together via a set of keyboard
gates. Simulations show that the oscillatory nature of the MBS splitting is not
a fundamental obstacle to readout, but requires nanoscale precision in the
control of the MBS spatial position. With experimentally realistic parameters
and fast (sub-ns) control of the dot gate voltage, we find that parity readout
fidelities &gt;99% are possible if the MBS position is controllable within ~1 nm.
Use of the scheme to measure the MBS splitting versus separation would present
a clear signature of the MBS. We show how the scheme can be extended to
distinguish valid parity measurements from invalid ones due to calibration
errors.

Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Here we
revisit this theorem and extend it to quantum circuits composed of Clifford and
T gates, where T is the single-qubit 45-degree phase shift. We assume that the
circuit outputs a bit string x obtained by measuring some subset of w qubits.
Two simulation tasks are considered: (1) computing the probability of a given
output x, and (2) sampling x from the output probability distribution. It is
shown that these tasks can be solved on a classical computer in time
$poly(n,m)+2^{0.5 t} t^3$ and $poly(n,m)+2^{0.23 t} t^3 w^4$ respectively,
where t is the number of T-gates, m is the total number of gates, and n is the
number of qubits. The proposed simulation algorithms may serve as a
verification tool for medium-size quantum computations that are dominated by
Clifford gates. The main ingredient of both algorithms is a subroutine for
approximating the norm of an n-qubit state which is given as a linear
combination of $\chi$ stabilizer states. The subroutine runs in time $\chi n^3
\epsilon^{-2}$, where $\epsilon$ is the relative error. We also develop
techniques for approximating tensor products of &quot;magic states&quot; by linear

the Bloch sphere, the Majorana representation (MR) provide us an intuitive way
to study a physical system with SU(2) symmetry. In this work, based on coherent
states, we propose a method to establish generalization of MR for a general
symmetry. By choosing a generalized coherent state as a reference state, we
give a more general MR for both finite and infinite systems and the
corresponding star equations are given. Using this method, we study the
squeezed vacuum states for three different symmetries, Heisenberg-Weyl, SU(2)

of stars. Furthermore, we also study the dynamical evolution of stars for an
initial coherent state driven by a nonlinear Hamiltonian, and find that at a
special time point, the stars are distributed on two orthogonal large circles.

Coulomb potential. Induced vacuum charge density is calculated and analyzed at
the subcritical and supercritical Coulomb potentials for massless and massive
fermions. For the massless case the induced vacuum charge density is localized
at the origin when the Coulomb center charge is subcritical while it has a
power-law tail when the Coulomb center charge is supercritical. The finite mass
contribution into the induced charge due to the vacuum polarization is small
and insignificantly distorts the Coulomb potential only at distances of order
of the Compton length. The induced vacuum charge has a screening sign. As is
known the quantum electrodynamics vacuum becomes unstable when the Coulomb
center charge is increased from subcritical to supercritical values. In the
supercritical Coulomb potential the quantum electrodynamics vacuum acquires the
charge due to the so-called real vacuum polarization. We calculate the real
vacuum polarization charge density. Screening of the Coulomb center charge are
briefly discussed. We expect that our results will be helpful for more deep
understanding of the fundamental problem of quantum electrodynamics and can as
a matter of principle be tested in graphene with a supercritical Coulomb

Remarkably, a recent proposal has shown that, in principle, such low-noise

squeezed state metrology 8 dB below the standard quantum limit with a detection

(OFR) was proposed for the ultracold alkali-earth (like) atoms, and
experimentally observed in the ultracold gases of $^{{\rm 173}}$Yb atoms.
Unlike most of the magnetic Feshbach resonances of ultracold alkali atoms, when
the OFR of $^{{\rm 173}}$Yb atoms appears, the energy gap between the
thresholds of the open channel (OC) and the closed channel (CC) is much smaller
than the characteristic energy of the inter-atomic interaction, i.e., the van
der Waals energy. In this paper we study the OFR in the systems with small
CC-OC threshold gap. We show that in these systems the OFR can be induced by
the coupling between the OC and either an isolated bound state of the CC or the
scattering states of the CC. Moreover, we also show that in each case the
two-channel Huang-Yang pesudopoential is always applicable for the approximate
calculation of the low-energy scattering amplitude. Our results imply that in
the theoretical calculations for these systems it is appropriate to take into
account the contributions from the scattering states of the CC.

and orbital parts has been a long-standing problem due to the constraint of
transversality condition on its vector wavefunction. A careful analysis shows
that the situation arises from a misuse of the constraint in quantum mechanics.
To use the constraint properly, we convert the vector representation into a
two-component representation in which the wavefunction is not constrained by
any conditions. Upon doing so, we not only separate the spin conceptually from
the orbital angular momentum but also identify the Berry gauge in which the
two-component wavefunction can be canonically quantized. A corollary is that
only in one particular Berry gauge can a radiation field be canonically
quantized in terms of the plane waves. The degree of freedom to fix the Berry
gauge, which reflects a symmetry of the constraint, turns out to have
observable quantum effects.

For attosecond pulses this spot size is within the nanometer scale. Then, we
show that a train of coherent ultrashort pulses can be used to excite a

the light intensity, thereby with the same spot size. The excitation process is
enabled due to quantum electrodynamics in the ultrafast light-matter

the usually neglected rotating terms are decisive to make the excitation
probability nonzero and depending on the light intensity. These results suggest
that a train of coherent attosecond pulses could be used to excite fluorescent

obstacles preventing the implementation of a high fidelity two-body gate below
the fault tolerance threshold. This noise is difficult to refocus as any
refocusing technique could only tackle noise with frequency below the operation
rate. Since the two qubit gate speed is normally the slowest rate in the
system, it constitutes the last bottleneck towards an implementation of a gate
below the fault tolerant threshold. Here we propose to use composite pulses as
a dynamical decoupling approach, in order to reduce two qubit gate noise for
trapped ions systems. This is done by refocusing the building blocks of
ultrafast entangling gates, where the amplitude noise is reduced to
shot-to-shot (STS) noise. We present detailed simulations showing that the
fault-tolerance threshold could be achieved with the proposed approach.

by an external electric field, it works also for weak coherent light fields,
and can e.g. be used as a frequency shifter for quantum memory devices in
quantum communication.

which are advantageous for applications in quantum memories, communication, and
scalable computation. These `binomial quantum codes' are formed from a finite
superposition of Fock states weighted with binomial coefficients. The binomial
codes can exactly correct errors that are polynomial up to a specific degree in
bosonic creation and annihilation operators, including amplitude damping and
displacement noise as well as boson addition and dephasing errors. For
realistic continuous-time dissipative evolution, the codes can perform
approximate quantum error correction to any given order in the timestep between
error detection measurements. We present an explicit approximate quantum error
recovery operation based on projective measurements and unitary operations. The
binomial codes are tailored for detecting boson loss and gain errors by means
of measurements of the generalized number parity. We discuss optimization of
the binomial codes and demonstrate that by relaxing the parity structure, codes
with even lower unrecoverable error rates can be achieved. The binomial codes
are related to existing two-mode bosonic codes but offer the advantage of
requiring only a single bosonic mode to correct amplitude damping as well as
the ability to correct other errors. Our codes are similar in spirit to `cat
codes' based on superpositions of the coherent states, but offer several
advantages such as smaller mean number, exact rather than approximate
orthonormality of the code words, and an explicit unitary operation for
repumping energy into the bosonic mode. The binomial quantum codes are
realizable with current superconducting circuit technology and they should
prove useful in other quantum technologies, including bosonic quantum memories,
photonic quantum communication, and optical-to-microwave up- and
down-conversion.

Neutrinos, and in particular the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations, should
adhere to quantum-mechanical predictions and provide an observable violation of
the Leggett-Garg inequality. We demonstrate how oscillation phenomena can be
used to test for violations of the classical bound. A study of the MINOS

provide strong evidence against &quot;hidden-variable theories,&quot; which are
deterministic alternatives to quantum mechanics. Several alternative tests of
the Leggett-Garg inequality with neutrino oscillations are also discussed.

convexity of various related functions. This result can be used to demonstrate
an interesting result in quantum information theory: the matrix $\Phi$-entropy
of a quantum ensemble is monotone under unital quantum channels. Finally, we
derive the operator Efron-Stein inequality to bound the operator-valued

We use a
new coherence measure with entropic nature and metric properties, based on the
quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence. The metric property allows for the coherence
to be decomposed into various contributions, which arise from local and
intrinsic coherences. We find that there are trade-off relations between the
various contributions of coherence, as a function of parameters of the quantum
state. In bipartite systems the coherence resides on individual sites or
distributed among the sites, which contribute in a complementary way. In more
complex systems, the characteristics of the coherence can display more subtle
changes with respect to the parameters of the quantum state. In the case of the
XXZ Heisenberg model, the coherence changes from a monogamous to a polygamous
nature. This allows us to define the shareability of coherence, leading to
monogamy relations for coherence.

complete-graph-type MQKA protocols. A MQKA protocol also exists that can resist

  regime</title><description>  To control light-matter interaction at the single-quantum level in cavity
quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) or circuit-QED, strong coupling between
the light and matter components is indispensable. Specifically, the coupling
rate $g$ must be larger than the decay rates. If $g$ is increased further and
becomes as large as the frequencies of light and matter excitations, the energy
eigenstates including the ground state are predicted to be highly entangled.
This qualitatively new coupling regime can be called the deep strong-coupling
regime. One approach toward the deep strong-coupling regime is to use huge
numbers of identical systems to take advantage of ensemble enhancement. With
the emergence of so-called macroscopic artificial atoms, superconducting qubits
for example, it has become possible for a single artificial atom to realize
ultrastrong coupling, where $\hbar g$ exceeds ~10% of the energies of the qubit
$\hbar \omega_q$ and the harmonic oscillator $\hbar \omega_o$. By making use of
the macroscopic magnetic dipole moment of a flux qubit, large
zero-point-fluctuation current of an LC oscillator, and large Josephson
inductance of a coupler junction, we have realized circuits in the deep
strong-coupling regime, where $g/\omega_o$ ranges from 0.72 to 1.34 and
$g/\omega_q$ &gt;&gt; 1. Using energy spectroscopy measurements, we have observed
unconventional transition spectra between Schrodinger cat-like energy
eigenstates. These states involve quantum superpositions of Fock states with
phase-space displacements of $\pm g/\omega_o$ and remarkably survive with
environmental noise. Our results provide a basis for ground-state-based
entangled-pair generation and open a new direction in circuit-QED.

discoveries as well as numerous important technologies. Over the last decades,
great strides have been made in increasing the strength of this interaction at
the single-photon level, leading to a continual exploration of new physics and
applications. In recent years, a major achievement has been the demonstration
of the so-called strong coupling regime, a key advancement enabling great
progress in quantum information science. In this work, we demonstrate
light-matter interaction over an order of magnitude stronger than previously
reported, reaching a new regime of ultrastrong coupling (USC). We achieve this
using a superconducting artificial atom tunably coupled to the electromagnetic
continuum of a one-dimensional waveguide. For the largest values of the
coupling, the spontaneous emission rate of the atom is comparable to its
transition frequency. In this USC regime, the conventional quantum description
of the atom and light as distinct entities breaks down, and a new description
in terms of hybrid states is required. Our results open the door to a wealth of
new physics and applications. Beyond light-matter interaction itself, the
tunability of our system makes it promising as a tool to study a number of
important physical systems such as the well-known spin-boson and Kondo models.

noncontextual realism. Realism demands that system properties exist
independently of whether they are measured, while noncontextuality demands that
the results of measurements do not depend on what other measurements are
performed in conjunction with them. The Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem states that
noncontextual realism cannot reproduce the measurement statistics of a single
three-level quantum system (qutrit). Noncontextual realistic models may thus be
tested using a single qutrit without relying on the notion of quantum
entanglement in contrast to Bell inequality tests. It is challenging to refute
such models experimentally, since imperfections may introduce loopholes that
enable a realist interpretation. Using a superconducting qutrit with
deterministic, binary-outcome readouts, we violate a noncontextuality
inequality while addressing the detection, individual-existence and
compatibility loopholes. Noncontextuality tests have been carried out in a
range of different physical systems and dimensionalities, including neutrons,
trapped ions and single photons, but no experiment addressing all three
loopholes has been performed in the qutrit scenario where entanglement cannot
play a role. Demonstrating state-dependent contextuality of a solid-state
system is also an important conceptual ingredient for universal quantum
computation in surface-code architectures, currently the most promising route
to scalable quantum computing.

oscillator's fluctuations as a function of the ratio between the strength of
the two couplings, focusing in particular on the situation in which the two
dissipative interactions are comparable. Analytic formulas are derived in the
relevant regimes corresponding to the low temperature limit and when the Drude
high frequency cutoff is much larger than all other frequencies. At low
temperature, each bath operates to suppress the oscillator's ground state
quantum fluctuations ${\langle \Delta \hat{q}^2 \rangle}_0$ or ${\langle \Delta

the two dissipative interactions dominates over the other, the fluctuations for
the coupling operator are squeezed. When the two interactions are comparable,
the two baths enter in competition as the two conjugate operators do not
commute yielding quantum frustration. In this regime, remarkably, the
fluctuations of both two quadratures can be enhanced by increasing the
dissipative coupling.

Although the edge-state conduction has been observed, unambiguous evidence of

to the helical character, the forward inter-edge scattering enforces a $\pi$

trivial $0$ spin rotation, which can be controlled by the Rashba spin-orbit

trait of Rydberg admixed atoms, which can be extended over many neighbouring
lattice sites. On contrary to dipolar gases, where the interactions follow an
inverse cubic law, the key feature of Rydberg-dressed interactions being the
possibility of making neighbouring couplings to the same magnitude as that of
the onsite ones. The maximally localized Wannier functions are typically
calculated via spread minimization procedure [Phys. Rev. B 56, 12847 (1997)]
and always found to be real functions apart from a trivial global phase when
considering an isolated set of Bloch bands. For an isolated single Bloch band,
the above procedure reduces to a simple quasi-momentum dependent unitary phase
transformation. Here, in stead of minimizing the spread, we employ a diagonal
phase transformation which eliminates the imaginary part of the Wannier
functions. The resulting Wannier states are found to be maximally localized and
in exact agreement with those obtained via spread minimization procedure. Using
that we calculate the Hubbard couplings from the Rydberg-admixed interactions,

where various examples of nanostructures with non-trivial shapes have been
synthesized and analyzed, turning the study of the quantum dynamics of a
constrained particle and the relation with geometry into a realistic and
important topic of research. Some decades ago, a formalism capable of giving a
meaningful Hamiltonian for the confined dynamics was devised. These results
showed that a quantum scalar potential, which depends explicitly on the
geometry of the curved region, acts upon the particle. In this work, we study
the confinement on curves and the problem of prescribed geometric potential,
i.e., finding a curve or a surface with a quantum geometric potential given
{\it a priori}. For the confinement on curves we show that in an intrinsic
scheme, i.e., in the absence of the quantum geometric potential, the spectrum
of a curve on any manifold only depends on the fixed length and imposed
boundary conditions. After, we investigate the one-dimensional confinement in a
surface (then, in a non-euclidean ambient space), where we show that the
geometric potential can give rise to both negative and positive potentials, a
result which is not possible if the ambient surface is flat. In addition, we
solve the problem of prescribed geometric potential for planar curves with an
emphasis on the case of power-law curvature functions, which allows us to model
the Hydrogen atom through a confinement in a curve. In the two-dimensional
case, we solve the prescribed geometric potential problem for surfaces with
rotation and translation symmetry, where in the last case we also show that the
problem for curves is equivalent to the problem for cylindrical surfaces.
Finally, we discuss on the nature of the quantum geometric potential and the

for any functions $f$. However, we restrict our study to the case of commuting
$X$'s. We focus in particular on the symmetries of the theory, and the minimal
length that emerge in some cases. We first show that, at the algebraic level,
there exists an unambiguous mapping between the GUP with a deformed quantum
algebra and a quadratic Hamiltonian into a standard, Heisenberg algebra of
operators and an aquadratic Hamiltonian, provided the boost sector of the
symmetries is modified accordingly. The theory can also be mapped to a
completely standard Quantum Mechanics with standard symmetries, but with
momentum dependent position operators. Next, we investigate the Hilbert space
representations of these algebraically equivalent models, and focus,
specifically on whether they exhibit a minimal length. We carry the functional
analysis of the various operators involved, and show that the appearance of a
minimal length critically depends on the relationship between the generators of
translations and the physical momenta. In particular, because this relationship
is preserved by the algebraic mapping presented in this paper, when a minimal
length is present in the standard GUP, it is also present in the corresponding
Aquadratic Hamiltonian formulation, despite the perfectly standard algebra of
this model. In general, a minimal length requires bounded generators of
translations, i.e. a specific kind of quantization of space, and this depends
on the precise shape of the function $f$ defined previously. This result
provides an elegant and unambiguous classification of which universal quantum

bath-electron coupling becomes unconventional. Moreover, because the kinetic
energy of the electron is quenched by the strong magnetic field, the electron
has no energy to give to or take from the bath, and so the usual connection
between frictional forces and dissipation no longer holds. These two features
make quantum Brownian motion topological, in the regime $l_F\gg l_B$, which is
at the verge of current experimental capabilities. We model topological quantum
Brownian motion in terms of an unconventional operator Langevin equation
derived from first principles, and solve this equation with the aim of
characterizing diffusion. While diffusion in the noncommutative plane turns out
to be conventional, with the mean displacement squared being proportional to
$t^\alpha$ and $\alpha=1$, there is an exotic regime for the proportionality
constant in which it is directly proportional to the friction coefficient and
inversely proportional to the square of the magnetic field: in this regime,
friction helps diffusion and the magnetic field suppresses all fluctuations. We
also show that quantum tunneling can be completely suppressed in the
noncommutative plane for suitably designed metastable potential wells, a
feature that might be worth exploiting for storage and protection of quantum
information.

is to identify ways to certify the correct functioning of a device when a
classical efficient simulation is not available. In such a situation one cannot
simply classically keep track of the dynamics of the device. In this note, we
discuss weak-membership notions of the certification for ground state
preparations of frustration-free Hamiltonians based on simple energy
measurements of local Hamiltonian terms. These considerations have applications
to classically intractable analog quantum simulations: for example, using
Feynman-Kitaev Hamiltonians, one can realise universal quantum computers. Our
certification approach is non-interactive and thus avoids challenges arising
from interactive proof systems. Moreover, our certification protocol is
applicable to recent results on so-called IQP circuits aiming at the

TZL protocol, the scrutineer Charlie does not have the required control over
the voting process. Apart from showing the limitations of TZL protocol, two
improved protocols for quantum voting along the line of TZL protocol are
proposed here. One of the proposed protocols is designed using a standard

generate a key and QKA has to satisfy the following conditions: 1 Every
participant can change the key and the key is not decided by any participant
individually. 2 Only participants can know the key; nonparticipants cannot get
the key through illegal means. Because of the condition 1 of participating
together, it makes transport inefficient in the current mainstream protocols.
They use unicast to exchange messages one by one, so it will considerably limit
transmission efficiency and increase cost time spent. This study proposes a
protocol based on Multiparty Quantum Secret Direct Communication (MQSDC) with
multicast. In addition to satisfying the above conditions, it uses multicast to
not only achieve the effect and purpose of QKA, but also to defend against
internal and external attacks at the same time. In regard to resource
consumption, this study involves linear growth and is more efficient than other

the influence of a harmonically oscillating electric field, e.g., a pump laser.
In the Peierls representation, this pump field can be represented as an
oscillating phase of the hopping rate $J(t)$, such that the effective
time-averaged rate $\bar J$ is reduced, i.e., switching the pump laser suddenly
is analogous to a quantum quench. Apart from this time-averaged rate $\bar J$,
it is well known that the oscillating component of $J(t)$ can resonantly create
particle-hole pairs if the pump frequency $\omega_{\rm pump}$ equals (or a
little exceeds) the Mott gap. In addition, we find that it is possible to
create multiple pairs if $\omega_{\rm pump}$ is near an integer multiple of the
gap. These findings should be relevant for pump-probe experiments.

coalesce. Typical examples are Rydberg systems in parallel electric and
magnetic fields, for which we solve the Schr\&quot;odinger equation in a complete

strengths and resonance energies of exceptional points and to verify their
basic properties. Additionally, we are able to visualise the wave functions of
the degenerate states. We report the existence of various exceptional points.
For the hydrogen atom these points are in an experimentally inaccessible regime
of field strengths. However, excitons in cuprous oxide in parallel electric and

  potential: Divergences, &quot;renormalization,&quot; anomalies, and Casimir forces</title><description>  Motivated by a desire to understand quantum fluctuation energy densities and
stress within a spatially varying dielectric medium, we examine the vacuum
expectation value for the stress tensor of a scalar field with arbitrary
conformal parameter, in the background of a given potential that depends on
only one spatial coordinate. We regulate the expressions by incorporating a
temporal-spatial cutoff in the (imaginary) time and transverse-spatial
directions. The divergences are captured by the zeroth- and second-order WKB
approximations. Then the stress tensor is &quot;renormalized&quot; by omitting the terms
that depend on the cutoff. The ambiguities that inevitably arise in this
procedure are both duly noted and restricted by imposing certain physical
conditions; one result is that the renormalized stress tensor exhibits the
expected trace anomaly. The renormalized stress tensor exhibits no pressure
anomaly, in that the principle of virtual work is satisfied for motions in a
transverse direction. We then consider a potential that defines a wall, a
one-dimensional potential that vanishes for $z&lt;0$ and rises like $z^\alpha$,
$\alpha&gt;0$, for $z&gt;0$. The full finite stress tensor is computed numerically
for the two cases where explicit solutions to the differential equation are
available, $\alpha=1$ and 2. The energy density exhibits an inverse linear
divergence as the boundary is approached from the inside for a linear
potential, and a logarithmic divergence for a quadratic potential. Finally, the
interaction between two such walls is computed, and it is shown that the
attractive Casimir pressure between the two walls also satisfies the principle
of virtual work (i.e., the pressure equals the negative derivative of the
energy with respect to the distance between the walls).

by unidirectional or asymmetric bidirectional quantum channels. In contrast to
the familiar photonic networks consisting of driven two-level atoms exchanging
photons via 1D photonic nanostructures, we propose and study a setup where
interactions between the atoms are mediated by spin excitations (magnons) in 1D
XX-spin chains representing a spin waveguide. While Markovian quantum network
theory eliminates quantum channels as structureless reservoirs in a Born-Markov
approximation to obtain a master equation for the nodes, we are interested in
non-Markovian dynamics. This arises from the nonlinear character of the
dispersion with band-edge effects, and from finite spin propagation velocities
leading to time delays in interactions. To account for the non-Markovian
dynamics we treat the quantum degrees of freedom of the nodes and connecting
channel as a composite spin system with the surrounding of the quantum network
as a Markovian bath, allowing for an efficient solution with time-dependent
density matrix renormalization group techniques. We illustrate our approach
showing non-Markovian effects in the driven-dissipative formation of quantum
dimers, and we present examples for quantum information protocols involving
quantum state transfer with engineered elements as basic building blocks of
quantum spintronic circuits.

  honeycomb lattice</title><description>  We determine the exact time evolution of an initial Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer
(BCS) state of ultra-cold atoms in a hexagonal optical lattice. The dynamical
evolution is triggered by ramping the lattice potential up, such that the
interaction strength $U_f$ is much larger than the hopping amplitude $J_f$. The
quench initiates collective oscillations with frequency $|U_f|/(2\pi)$ in the
momentum occupation numbers and imprints an oscillating phase with the same
frequency on the order parameter $\Delta$. The latter is not reproduced by
treating the time evolution in mean-field theory. The momentum density-density
or noise correlation functions oscillate at frequency $|U_f|/2\pi$ as well as
its second harmonic. For a very deep lattice, with negligible tunneling energy,
the oscillations of momentum occupation numbers are undamped. Non-zero
tunneling after the quench leads to dephasing of the different momentum modes
and a subsequent damping of the oscillations. This occurs even for a
finite-temperature initial BCS state, but not for a non-interacting Fermi gas.
We therefore propose to use this dephasing to detect a BCS state. Finally, we
predict that the noise correlation functions in a honeycomb lattice will
develop strong anti-correlations near the Dirac point.

single-neuron APs. Our technique has a unique combination of features: (i) it
is noninvasive, as the light that probes the NV sensors stays within the
biocompatible diamond chip and does not enter the organism, enabling activity
monitoring over extended periods; (ii) it is label-free and should be widely
applicable to most organisms; (iii) it provides high spatial and temporal
resolution, allowing precise measurement of the AP waveforms and conduction
velocities of individual neurons; (iv) it directly determines AP propagation
direction through the inherent sensitivity of NVs to the associated AP magnetic
field vector; (v) it is applicable to neurons located within optically opaque
tissue or whole organisms, through which magnetic fields pass largely
unperturbed; and (vi) it is easy-to-use, scalable, and can be integrated with
existing techniques such as wide-field and superresolution imaging. We

exterior to whole, live, opaque marine worms for extended periods with no

(ii) that the required topological charge projections can be implemented as

of such a theory. Specifically, we consider local dissipative dynamics
preparing a steady-state of quantum spins on a lattice exhibiting a discrete or
continuous symmetry but with extensive fluctuations in a local order parameter.
We show that for all such processes satisfying detailed balance, there exist
metastable symmetry-breaking states, i.e., states that become stationary in the
thermodynamic limit and give a finite value to the order parameter. We give
results both for discrete and continuous symmetries and explicitly show how to
construct the symmetry-breaking states. Our results show in a simple way that,

densities and the cross-moments of the eigenvalues of the reduced density
matrix, i.e. the so-called Schmidt eigenvalues, and the analogous functionals
of the eigenvalues of the Wishart-Laguerre ensemble of the random matrix
theory. This allows us to derive explicit expressions for two-level densities,
and also an exact expression for the variance of von Neumann entropy at finite
$N,M$. Then we focus on the moments $\mathbb{E}\{K^a\}$ of the Schmidt number
$K$, the reciprocal of the purity. This is a random variable supported on
$[1,N]$, which quantifies the number of degrees of freedom effectively
contributing to the entanglement. We derive a wealth of analytical results for
$\mathbb{E}\{K^a\}$ for $N = 2$ and $N=3$ and arbitrary $M$, and also for
square $N = M$ systems by spotting for the latter a connection with the
probability $P(x_{min}^{GUE} \geq \sqrt{2N}\xi)$ that the smallest eigenvalue
$x_{min}^{GUE}$ of a $N\times N$ matrix belonging to the Gaussian Unitary
Ensemble is larger than $\sqrt{2N}\xi$. As a byproduct, we present an exact
asymptotic expansion for $P(x_{min}^{GUE} \geq \sqrt{2N}\xi)$ for finite $N$ as
$\xi \to \infty$. Our results are corroborated by numerical simulations
whenever possible, with excellent agreement.

a system decaying in a structured bosonic environment and subject to a control
field. The interaction with the environment induces decay from the excited to
the ground level, which, in turn, is coherently coupled to another meta-stable
state. The control of the strength of the coherent coupling between the stable
levels allows the engineering of both the dissipation and of the memory
effects, without modifying neither the system-reservoir interaction, nor
environmental properties. We use this framework in two different parameter
regimes corresponding to fast (bad cavity limit) and slow dissipation (good
cavity limit) in the original, un-controlled qubit system. Our results show a
non-monotonic behavior of memory effects when increasing the effectiveness of
the Zeno-like freezing. Moreover, we identify a new source of memory effects
which allows the persistence of non-Markovianity for long times while the
excited state has already been depleted.

identical single photons on demand, capable of integration into solid-state
devices. It has been proposed that such molecules in a crystalline organic
matrix might be placed close to an optical waveguide for this purpose, but so
far there have been no demonstrations of sufficiently thin crystals, with a
controlled concentration of suitable dopant molecules. Here we present a method
for growing very thin anthracene crystals from super-saturated vapour, which
produces crystals of extreme flatness and controlled thickness. We show how
this crystal can be doped with a widely adjustable concentration of
dibenzoterrylene (DBT) molecules and we examine the optical properties of these
molecules to demonstrate their suitability as quantum emitters in nanophotonic
devices. Our measurements show that the molecules are available in the crystal
as single quantum emitters, with a well-defined polarisation relative to the
crystal axes, making them amenable to alignment with optical nanostructures. We
find that the radiative lifetime and saturation intensity vary little within
the crystal and are not in any way compromised by the unusual matrix
environment. We show that a large fraction of these emitters are able to
deliver more than $10^{12}$ photons without photo-bleaching, making them
suitable for real applications.

perturbatively evaluate the electromagnetic radiated energy-flux of the excited
dipole. Our results indicate that the standard interpretation of a bare atom
surrounded by a localised virtual photon cloud, is difficult to sustain,
because the radiated energy-flux surviving infinitely far from the source
contains virtual contributions. It follows that there is a clear distinction to
be made between a radiative photon defined in terms of the radiation fields,
and a real photon, whose identification depends on whether or not a given
process conserves the free energy. This free energy is represented by the

  presence of dephasing noise</title><description>  In the presence of strong dephasing noise the dynamics of Rydberg gases
becomes effectively classical, due to the rapid decay of quantum superpositions
between atomic levels. Recently a great deal of attention has been devoted to
the stochastic dynamics that emerges in that limit, revealing several
interesting features, including kinetically-constrained glassy behaviour,
self-similarity and aggregation effects. However, the non-equilibrium physics
of these systems, in particular in the regime where coherent and dissipative
processes contribute on equal footing, is yet far from being understood. To
explore this we study the dynamics of a small one-dimensional Rydberg lattice
gas subject to dephasing noise by numerically integrating the quantum Master
equation. We find indications that the main features observed in the strongly
dissipative limit persist when the dissipation is not strong enough to
annihilate quantum coherences at the dynamically relevant time scales. These
features include a power law growth of the density of excitations and the
existence of a time-dependent Rydberg blockade radius. Our results indicate
that the power-law growth of density of excitations is characterised by an
exponent which decreases as the dissipation becomes weaker.

  regime based on a reaction coordinate mapping</title><description>  We propose a method to study the thermodynamic behaviour of small systems
beyond the weak coupling and Markovian approximation, which is different in
spirit from conventional approaches. The idea is to redefine the system and
environment such that the effective, redefined system is again coupled weakly
to Markovian residual baths and thus, allows to derive a consistent
thermodynamic framework for this new system-environment partition. To achieve
this goal we make use of the reaction coordinate mapping, which is a general
method in the sense that it can be applied to an arbitrary (quantum or
classical and even time-dependent) system coupled linearly to an arbitrary
number of harmonic oscillator reservoirs. The core of the method relies on an
appropriate identification of a part of the environment (the reaction
coordinate), which is subsequently included as a part of the system. We
demonstrate the power of this concept by showing that non-Markovian effects can
significantly enhance the steady state efficiency of a three-level-maser heat
engine, even in the regime of weak system-bath coupling. Furthermore, we show
for a single electron transistor coupled to vibrations that our method allows
one to justify master equations derived in a polaron transformed reference

as active lasing medium when coupled to a microwave resonator. For these
artificial atoms, in contrast to real atoms, variations in their parameters
cannot be avoided. In this paper, we examine the influence of disorder on such
a multi-atom lasing setup. We find that the lasing process evolves into a
self-organized stationary state that is quite robust against disorder. The
reason is that photons created by those atoms which are in or close to
resonance with the resonator stimulate the emission also of more detuned atoms.
Not only the number of photons grows with the number of atoms, but also the
width of the resonance as function of the detuning. Similar properties are
found for other types of disorder such as variations in the individual
coupling. We present relations how the allowed disorder scales with the number
of atoms and confirm it by a numerical analysis. We also provide estimates for
the sample-to-sample variations to be expected for setups with moderate numbers
of atoms.

  In this direction, we establish quantum versions of several fundamental

semantic security and indistinguishability, and, in analogy with the classical

we construct secure quantum encryption schemes from basic primitives. In

world. Beyond encryption of data lies obfuscation, i.e., encryption of
functionality. It is well-known that the most powerful means of obfuscating
classical programs, so-called ``black-box obfuscation',' is provably impossible
[Barak et al '12]. However, several recent results have yielded candidate
schemes that satisfy a definition weaker than black-box, and yet still have
numerous applications.
  In this work, we initialize the rigorous study of obfuscating programs via
quantum-mechanical means. We define notions of quantum obfuscation which
encompass several natural variants. The input to the obfuscator can describe
classical or quantum functionality, and the output can be a circuit description
or a quantum state. The obfuscator can also satisfy one of a number of
obfuscation conditions: black-box, information-theoretic black-box,
indistinguishability, and best possible; the last two conditions come in three
variants: perfect, statistical, and computational. We discuss many
applications, including CPA-secure quantum encryption, quantum
fully-homomorphic encryption, and public-key quantum money.
  We then prove several impossibility results, extending a number of
foundational papers on classical obfuscation to the quantum setting. We prove
that quantum black-box obfuscation is impossible in a setting where adversaries
can possess more than one output of the obfuscator. In particular, generic
transformation of quantum circuits into black-box-obfuscated quantum circuits
is impossible. We also show that statistical indistinguishability obfuscation
is impossible, up to an unlikely complexity-theoretic collapse. Our proofs
involve a new tool: chosen-ciphertext-secure encryption of quantum data, which
was recently shown to be possible assuming quantum-secure one-way functions
exist [Alagic et al '16].

Mach-Zehnder interferometers fabricated by using planar lightwave circuit

experimental quantum science for quantum information applications and probing
the fundamentals of physics. Here, we investigate permutations of quantum
non-demolition quadrature measurements and single quanta addition/subtraction
to prepare quantum superposition states in bosonic systems. The performance of
each permutation is quantified and compared using several different
non-classicality criteria including Wigner negativity, non-classical depth, and
optimal fidelity with a coherent state superposition. We also compare the
performance of our protocol using squeezing instead of a quadrature measurement
and find that the purification provided by the quadrature measurement can
significantly increase the non-classicality generated. Our approach is ideally
suited for implementation in light-matter systems such as quantum optomechanics
and atomic spin ensembles, and offers considerable robustness to initial
thermal occupation.

non-commutativity of two observables? The immediate answer to such a question
is: it depends. Due to the plethora of uncertainty measures there are many
answers. Here, instead of restricting our study to a particular measure, we
present plausible axioms for the set $\mathcal{F}$ of bona-fide
information-theoretic uncertainty functions. Then, we discuss the existence of
states minimising uncertainty with respect to all members of $\mathcal{F}$,
i.e., universal minimum uncertainty states (MUS). We prove that such states do
not exist within the full state space and study the effect of classical noise
on the structure of minimum uncertainty states. We present an explicit example
of a qubit universal MUS that arises when purity is constrained by introducing
a threshold amount of noise. For higher dimensional systems we derive several
no-go results limiting the existence of noisy universal MUS. However, we
conjecture that universality may emerge in an approximate sense. We conclude by
discussing connections with thermodynamics, and highlight the privileged role
that non-equilibrium free energy $F_2$ plays close to equilibrium.

applications to achieve quantum supremacy, performing faster on a quantum than
a classical computer. However, if future quantum devices are to produce
accurate calculations, errors due to environmental noise and algorithmic
approximations need to be characterized and reduced. In this study, we use the
high performance qHiPSTER software to investigate the effects of environmental
noise on the preparation of quantum chemistry states. We simulated eighteen
16-qubit quantum circuits under environmental noise, each corresponding to a
unitary coupled cluster state preparation of a different molecule or molecular
configuration. Additionally, we analyze the nature of simple gate errors in
noise-free circuits of up to 40 qubits. We find that the Jordan-Wigner (JW)
encoding produces consistently smaller errors under a noisy environment as
compared to the Bravyi-Kitaev (BK) encoding. For the JW encoding,
pure-dephasing noise is shown to produce substantially smaller errors than pure
relaxation noise of the same magnitude. We report error trends in both
molecular energy and electron particle number within a unitary coupled cluster
state preparation scheme, against changes in nuclear charge, bond length,
number of electrons, noise types, and noise magnitude. These trends may prove
to be useful in making algorithmic and hardware-related choices for quantum
simulation of molecular energies.

detectors in which a single photon triggers an avalanche current. The resulting
signal is then processed and stored in a computer. Here, we propose an approach

We show in particular, that the micro entanglement that is produced by sending
a single photon into a beam-splitter can be detected with the eye using the
magnifying glass of a displacement in phase space. The feasibility study
convincingly demonstrates the possibility to realize the first experiment where
entanglement is observed with the eye.

amplified spontaneous emission (RASE). Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE),
resulting from an inverted ensemble of Pr$^{3+}$ ions doped into a Y$_2$SiO$_5$

photon echo technique. Entanglement between the ASE and its echo is confirmed
and the inseparability violation preserved when the RASE is stored as a

almost perfect distinguishability between two temporal modes demonstrated.
These results pave the way for the use of multimode solid state quantum

the electron to be a particle; we consider an electrically charged classical
wave field, an &quot;electron wave&quot;, which is held in a limited region of space by
the electrostatic field of the proton. It is shown that quantum mechanics must
be considered to be not a theory of particles but a classical field theory in
the spirit of classical electrodynamics. In this case, we are not faced with
difficulties in interpreting the results of the theory. In the framework of
classical electrodynamics, all of the well-known regularities of the
spontaneous emission of the hydrogen atom are obtained, which is usually
derived in the framework of quantum electrodynamics. It is shown that there are
no discrete states and discrete energy levels of the atom: the energy of the
atom and its states change continuously. An explanation of the conventional
corpuscular-statistical interpretation of atomic phenomena is given. It is
shown that this explanation is only a misinterpretation of continuous
deterministic processes. In the framework of classical electrodynamics, the
nonlinear Schrodinger equation is obtained, which accounts for the inverse
action of self-electromagnetic radiation of the electron wave and completely
describes the spontaneous emissions of an atom.

that the connection rules should be independent of the state of the input to
the network. To compute statistical properties, we use a version of Wicks'
Theorem involving fictitious vacuum fields (Fock space based representation of
the fields) and while this aids computation, and gives a rigorous formulation,
the various representations need not be unitarily equivalent. In particular, a
naive application of the connection rules would lead to the wrong answer. We
establish the correct interconnection rules, and show that while the quantum
stochastic differential equations of motion display explicitly the covariances
(thermal and squeezing parameters) of the Gaussian input fields We introduce
the Wick-Stratonovich form which leads to a way of writing these equations that
does not depend on these covariances and so corresponds to the universal

wholly consistent theory of quantum open systems in series can be developed in
this way, and as required physically, is universal and in particular
representation-free.

  quantum charge states</title><description>  Many-body correlations and macroscopic quantum behaviors are fascinating
condensed matter problems. A powerful test-bed for the many-body concepts and
methods is the Kondo model which entails the coupling of a quantum impurity to
a continuum of states. It is central in highly correlated systems and can be
explored with tunable nanostructures. Although Kondo physics is usually
associated with the hybridization of itinerant electrons with microscopic
magnetic moments, theory predicts that it can arise whenever degenerate quantum
states are coupled to a continuum. Here we demonstrate the previously elusive
`charge' Kondo effect in a hybrid metal-semiconductor implementation of a
single-electron transistor, with a quantum pseudospin-1/2 constituted by two
degenerate macroscopic charge states of a metallic island. In contrast to other
Kondo nanostructures, each conduction channel connecting the island to an
electrode constitutes a distinct and fully tunable Kondo channel, thereby
providing an unprecedented access to the two-channel Kondo effect and a clear
path to multi-channel Kondo physics. Using a weakly coupled probe, we reveal
the renormalization flow, as temperature is reduced, of two Kondo channels
competing to screen the charge pseudospin. This provides a direct view of how
the predicted quantum phase transition develops across the symmetric quantum
critical point. Detuning the pseudospin away from degeneracy, we demonstrate,
on a fully characterized device, quantitative agreement with the predictions
for the finite-temperature crossover from quantum criticality.

such complex squeezing is a component of ponderomotive squeezing of light

flux of an incoherent light source. The intensity of a laser reference signal
is measured, before and after contamination by photon bunching noise
(transimpedance gain of 20k), simultaneously. Moreover, the measurement
containing photon bunching noise was done using two schemes: direct and
homodyne detection, also with no appreciable time delay. The sampling rate of
all measurements is the same, and is always higher than the frequency limit of
the bunching noise. By carefully comparing the resulting three time series, it
is found, surprisingly, that the homodyne detection of the incoherent signal
resembles more closely the variance and variability pattern of the original
coherent signal, and the effect is most prominent at the highest sampling
frequency. It therefore appears flux estimates made using the shot noise of the
field were able to overcome the Nyquist theorem, viz. by combining the homodyne
technique with sampling at a rate faster than the bunching noise fluctuations
it is possible to surpass the sensitivity limit of the radiometer equation.
This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that such a detailed
analysis of shot noise fluctuations has been investigated experimentally.
Although a full theoretical understanding is still lacking, the experiments
appear to show an unambiguous effect that requires further investigation.

incomplete, since the intermediate state induced by collapse of the wave
function apparently depends upon the inertial rest frame in which the

avoids the issue of wave function collapse, it, too, is a casualty of the
special theory of relativity. This requires all events in the universe, past,
present and future, to be unique, as in the block universe picture, which rules
out Everett style branching. The benefits of MWI may be retained, however, by
postulating a multiverse of discrete, parallel, block universes which are
identical to each other up to certain points in the MWI trunk before they
diverge according to the MWI branching. The quantum probability of an event
then emerges from the number of parallel universes in which the event happens
divided by the total number of universes. This means that the total number of
such universes is finite. Such a picture is more easily envisaged by thinking
of it as a purely mathematical structure, as in the Mathematical Universe
Hypothesis proposed by Tegmark. However, while Tegmark wished to avoid
contamination from Goedelian self referential knots, not only does such
contamination appear to be inevitable, it brings an unexpected benefit. The
mathematical hierarchy required by the enigmatic footnote 48a in the paper by
Goedel leads to an explanation for a unitary evolution of deterministic quantum
rules across the multiverse while accounting for quantum uncertainty within an
individual universe. Other aspects of this structure, called here the Plexus,
are discussed, including awareness of existence and other questions raised by

prepared in an inertial frame of reference, is described by a pair of uniformly
accelerated observers. We explicitly compute the resulting state for
arbitrarily chosen proper accelerations of the observers and independently
tuned distance between them. To do so, we introduce a generalized Rindler frame
of reference and analytically derive the corresponding state transformation as
a Gaussian channel. Our approach provides several new insights into the
phenomenon of vacuum entanglement such as the highly non-trivial effect of
spatial separation between the observers including sudden death of
entanglement. We also calculate the fidelity of the two-mode channel for
non-vacuum Gaussian states and obtain bounds on classical and quantum
capacities of a single-mode channel. Our framework can be directly applied to
any continuous variable quantum information protocol in which the effects of
acceleration or gravity cannot be neglected.

With simultaneous read out from both channels quantum properties of the

would be incomplete if its statistical predictions could not be accounted for
some realistic models with hidden variables. There are, however, two powerful
theorems against the hidden-variable theories showing that certain quantum
features cannot be reproduced based on two rationale premises of classicality,
the Bell theorem, and noncontextuality, due to Bell, Kochen and Specker (BKS) .
Tests of the Bell inequality and the BKS theorem are both of fundamental
interests and of great significance . The Bell theorem has already been
experimentally verified extensively on many different systems , while the
quantum contextuality, which is independent of nonlocality and manifests itself
even in a single object, is experimentally more demanding. Moreover, the
contextuality has been shown to play a critical role to supply the `magic' for
quantum computation, making more extensive experimental verifications in
potential systems for quantum computing even more stringent. Here we report an
experimental verification of quantum contextuality on an individual atomic
nuclear spin-1 system in solids under ambient condition. Such a three-level
system is indivisible and thus the compatibility loophole, which exists in the
experiments performed on bipartite systems, is closed. Our experimental results
confirm that the quantum contextuality cannot be explained by nonlocal
entanglement, revealing the fundamental quantumness other than
locality/nonlocality within the intrinsic spin freedom of a concrete natural
atomic solid-state system at room temperature.

  Interpretation</title><description>  Quantum Mechanics, the physical theory describing the microworld, represents
one of science's greatest triumphs. It lies at the root of all modern digital
technologies and offers unparalleled correspondence between prediction and
experiments. Remarkably, however, after more than 100 years it is still unclear
what quantum mechanics means in terms of basic philosophical questions about
the nature of reality. While there are many interpretations of the mathematical
machinery of quantum physics, there remains no experimental means to
distinguish between most of them.
  In this contribution, (based on a discussion at the NYAS), I wish to consider
the ways in which the enduring lack of an agreed upon interpretation of quantum
physics influences a number of critical philosophical debates about physics and
reality. I briefly review two problems effected by quantum interpretations: the
meaning of the term 'Universe' and the nature of consciousness. In what follows
I am explicitly not advocating for any particular quantum interpretation.
Instead, I am interested in how the explicit inability of modern physics to
experimentally distinguish between interpretations with wildly divergent
ontological/epistemological implications plays into discussions of physics and
its description of the world.

The position of a meter's needle can be determined with an arbitrarily small
uncertainty. In the quantum realm, however, fundamental quantum fluctuations
due to the Heisenberg principle limit the measurement precision. The simplest
measurement procedures, involving semi-classical states of the meter, lead to a
fluctuation-limited imprecision at the standard quantum limit. By engineering
the quantum state of the meter system, the measurement imprecision can be
reduced down to the fundamental Heisenberg Limit (HL). Quantum-enabled
metrology techniques are thus in high demand and the focus of an intense
activity. We report here a quantum-enabled measurement of an electric field
based on this approach. We cast Rydberg atoms in Schr\&quot;odinger cat states,
superpositions of atomic levels with radically different polarizabilites. We
use a quantum interference process to perform a measurement close to the HL,
reaching a single-shot sensitivity of 1.2 mV/cm for a 100 ns interaction time,
corresponding to 30 $\mu$V/cm/Hz^(1/2) at our 3 kHz repetition rate. This
highly sensitive, non-invasive space- and time-resolved field measurement
extends the realm of electrometric techniques and could have important
practical applications. Detection of individual electrons in mesoscopic devices
at a ~100 $\mu$m distance, with a MegaHertz bandwith is within reach.

to two thermal reservoirs and therefore behave as a single large spin. The
coupling with one reservoir implements the usual Dicke superradiance setup. By
contrast, the coupling with the other reservoir is of the pure dephasing type.
To describe also the strong-coupling limit with the dephasing reservoir, we
apply a reaction-coordinate mapping, which leads to a decomposition of the
dephasing reservoir into a single collective degree of freedom, and residual
oscillators. After the mapping, the large spin is coupled to the reaction
coordinate with the original pure-dephasing interaction, but the reaction
coordinate is dissipatively coupled to the residual oscillators. We first
derive the quantum-optical master equation for the large spin and the reaction
coordinate. To obtain a convenient representation as a rate equation, we switch
to the energy eigenbasis of the large spin and the reaction coordinate by using
a polaron transformation. Assuming fast relaxation of the reaction coordinate,
we then derive a coarse-grained rate equation for the large spin only and
discuss how the original Dicke superradiance is affected by the presence of the
additional reservoir. Our main finding is a cooperatively enhanced
rectification effect due to the interplay of supertransmittant heat currents
(scaling quadratically with $N$) and the asymmetric coupling to both
reservoirs. For large $N$, the system can thus significantly amplify current
asymmetries under bias reversal, functioning as a heat diode.

If correct, this would be contrary to the normal interpretation of such

  However, in this note, a generalised Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)

Here we consider a broad class of models where one of these assumptions, Bell's

explanation of long range correlations between outcomes of distant
measurements, performed on pairs of physical systems prepared in a spin singlet
state, John Bell analysed local realistic hidden variable models and proved
that correlations consistent with these models satisfy Bell inequalities which
are violated by some predictions of quantum mechanics. Several different local
models were constructed, various inequalities proven and shown to be violated
by experimental data. Some physicists concluded that Nature is definitely not
local. We strongly disagree with this conclusion and we critically analyze some
influential finite sample proofs of various inequalities and so called quantum
Randi challenges. We also show how one can win so called Bell game.The
violation of inequalities does not prove that local and causal explanation of
correlations is impossible. The violation of inequalities gives only a strong
argument against counterfactual definiteness and against a point of view
according to which experimental outcomes are produced in irreducible random
way. We also explain the meaning of sample homogeneity loophole and show how it
can invalidate statistical significance tests. We point out that this loophole
was not closed in several recent experiments testing local realism.

condensates in a laser-generated annular trap. By tailoring the diameter and
power of the annular trap, the polariton condensate can be switched among
different trapped modes, accompanied by redistribution of spatial densities and
superlinear increase in the emission intensities, implying that polariton
condensates in this geometry could be exploited for a multistate switch. A

a physically reasonable set of orthogonal wave functions for a quantum spin
system. Usually, we are given a local Hamiltonian and try to characterize the
relevant wave functions and energies (the spectrum) of the system. Here, we
take the opposite approach; starting from a collection of orthogonal wave
functions, our goal is to characterize the associated parent Hamiltonian, to
see how the wave functions and the energy values determine the structure of the
parent Hamiltonian. Specifically, we obtain (quasi) local Hamiltonians by a
complete set of (multilayer) product states and a local mapping of the energy
values to the wave functions. On the other hand, a complete set of tree wave
functions (having a tree structure) results to nonlocal Hamiltonians and
operators which flip simultaneously all the spins in a single branch of the
tree graph. We observe that even for a given set of wave functions, the energy
spectrum can significantly change the nature of interactions in the
Hamiltonian. These effects can be exploited in a quantum engineering problem
optimizing an objective functional of the Hamiltonian.

discrete and continuous variables to the channel noise. We introduce the model
of such noise based on coupling of the signal to a thermal bath, typical for
continuous-variable quantum key distribution, to the discrete-variable case.
Then we perform a comparison of the bounds on the tolerable channel noise
between these two kinds of protocols using the same noise parametrization, in
the case of implementation which is perfect otherwise. Obtained results show
that continuous-variable protocols can exhibit similar robustness to the
channel noise when the transmittance of the channel is relatively high.
However, for strong loss discrete-variable protocols are superior and can
overcome even the infinite-squeezing continuous-variable protocol while using
limited nonclassical resources. The requirement on the probability of a
single-photon production which would have to be fulfilled by a practical source
of photons in order to demonstrate such superiority is feasible thanks to the
recent rapid development in this field.

solid-state quantum computation due to leakage in transporting a single-spin
qubit through a semiconductor double quantum dot. In particular, we consider
three possible sources of leakage errors associated with such transport: finite
ramping times, spin-dependent tunneling rates between quantum dots induced by
finite spin-orbit couplings, and the presence of multiple valley states. In
each case we present quantitative estimates of the leakage errors, and discuss
how they can be minimized. Moreover, we show that in order to minimize leakage

elementary spin waves (magnons) in quantum magnets have been experimentally
observed in quantum Heisenberg chains comprising ultracold Bose atoms in
optical lattices. Here, we explore an unprecedented topological state called
topological magnon bound-state in the quantum Heisenberg chain under
cotranslational symmetry. We find that the cotranslational symmetry allows us
to formulate a direct topological invariant for the multi-particle quantum

multi-magnon excitations. We calculate energy spectra, density distributions,
correlations and topological invariants of the two-magnon bound-states and show
the existence of topological magnon bound-states. Our study not only opens a
new prospect to pursue topological bound-states, but also gives insights into

and therefore almost certainly possesses neither differentiable Dirac
observables nor a reduced phase space. It follows that the standard notion of
observable has to be extended to include non-differentiable or even
discontinuous generalized observables. These cannot carry Poisson-algebraic
structures and do not admit a standard quantization; one thus faces a quantum
representation problem of gravitational observables. This has deep consequences
for a quantum theory of gravity, which we investigate in a simple model for a
system with Hamiltonian constraint that fails to be completely integrable. We
show that basing the quantization on standard topology precludes a
semiclassical limit and can even prohibit any solutions to the quantum
constraints. Our proposed solution to this problem is to refine topology such
that a complete set of Dirac observables becomes continuous. In the toy model,
it turns out that a refinement to a polymer-type topology, as e.g. used in loop
gravity, is sufficient. Basing quantization of the toy model on this finer
topology, we find a complete set of quantum Dirac observables and a suitable
semiclassical limit. This strategy is applicable to realistic candidate
theories of quantum gravity and thereby suggests a solution to a long-standing
problem which implies ramifications for the very concept of quantization. Our
work reveals a qualitatively novel facet of chaos in physics and opens up a new
avenue of research on chaos in gravity which hints at deep insights into the
structure of quantum gravity.

Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a partially condensed Bose gas containing a
single quantum vortex show that the transfer of condensate energy to the
incoherent thermal component without population transfer provides an important
channel for vortex decay. For the lower temperatures considered, this effect is
significantly larger that the population transfer process underpinning the
standard theory of vortex decay, and is the dominant determinant of the vortex
lifetime. A comparison with the Zaremba-Nikuni-Griffin kinetic (two-fluid)

  using energy penalty</title><description>  One of the main methods for protecting quantum information against
decoherence is to encode information in the ground subspace (or the low energy
sector) of a Hamiltonian with a large energy gap which penalizes errors from
environment. The protecting Hamiltonian is chosen such that its degenerate
ground subspace is an error detecting code for the errors caused by the
interaction with the environment. We consider environments with arbitrary
number of local sites, e.g. spins, whose interactions among themselves are
local and bounded. Then, assuming the system is interacting with a finite
number of sites in the environment, we prove that, up to second order with
respect to the coupling constant, decoherence and relaxation are suppressed by
a factor which grows exponentially fast with the ratio of energy penalty to the
norm of local interactions in the environment. The state may, however, still
evolve unitarily inside the code subspace due to the Lamb shift effect. In the
context of adiabatic quantum computation, this means that the evolution inside
the code subspace is effectively governed by a renormalized Hamiltonian. The
result is derived from first principles, without use of master equations or
their assumptions, and holds even in the infinite temperature limit. We also
prove that unbounded or non-local interactions in the environment at sites far
from the system do not considerably modify the exponential suppression. Our
main technical tool is a new bound on the decay of power spectral density at
high frequencies for local observables and many-body Hamiltonians with bounded
and local interactions in a neighborhood around the support of the observable.

fluoresce in molecular sized NDs (1 to 6 nm) and its spectral properties depend
on the quality of the surrounding host lattice. This defect is therefore a good
probe to investigate the material properties of small NDs. Here we report
unprecedented narrow optical transitions for SiV colour centers hosted in
nanodiamonds produced using a novel high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT)

distribution of 1.05 nm at 5 K across a sample of numerous NDs. Individual
spectral lines as narrow as 354 MHz were measured for SiV centres in
nanodiamonds smaller than 200 nm, which is four times narrower than the best
SiV line previously reported for nanodiamonds. Correcting for apparent spectral
diffusion yielded a homogeneous linewith of about 200 MHz, which is close to
the width limit imposed by the radiative lifetime. These results demonstrate
that the direct HPHT synthesis technique is capable of producing nanodiamonds

if either (i) the input is a computational basis state and the simulation

the output of the circuit consists of a single qubit. In this paper we extend

and if adaptive measurements are allowed. This remains true even for arbitrary

devices unless the mechanical frequency is very high or the thermodynamic
temperature is very low. This paper addresses the design concept for a novel
optomechanical device capable of ultrahigh quality factors in the audio
frequency band with negligible thermal noise. The proposed system consists of a
minimally supported millimeter scale pendulum mounted in a Double End-Mirror
Sloshing (DEMS) cavity that is topologically equivalent to a
Membrane-in-the-Middle (MIM) cavity. The radiation pressure inside the
high-finesse cavity allows for high optical stiffness, cancellation of terms
which lead to unwanted negative damping and suppression of quantum radiation
pressure noise. We solve for the optical spring dynamics of the system using
the Hamiltonian, find the noise spectral density and show that stable optical
trapping is possible. We also assess various loss mechanisms, one of the most
important being the acceleration loss due to the optical spring. We show that
practical devices, starting from a centre-of-mass pendulum frequency of 0.1 Hz,
could achieve a maximum quality factor of $10^{14}$ with optical spring
stiffened frequency 1-10 kHz. Small resonators of mass 1 $\mu$g or less could
achieve a Q-factor of $10^{11}$ at a frequency of 100 kHz. Applications for
such devices include white light cavities for improvement of gravitational wave
detectors, or sensors able to operate near the quantum limit.

  silicon</title><description>  Gate control of donor electrons near interfaces is a generic ingredient of
donor-based quantum computing. Here, we address the question: how is the
phonon-assisted qubit relaxation time $T_1$ affected as the electron is
shuttled between the donor and the interface? We focus on the example of the
`flip-flop qubit' [Tosi et al., arXiv:1509.08538v1], defined as a combination
of the nuclear and electronic states of a phosphorous donor in silicon,
promising fast electrical control and long dephasing times when the electron is
halfway between the donor and the interface. We theoretically describe orbital
relaxation, flip-flop relaxation, and electron spin relaxation. We estimate
that the flip-flop qubit relaxation time can be of the order of $100 \,
\mu\text{s}$, 8 orders of magnitude shorter than the value for an on-donor
electron in bulk silicon, and a few orders of magnitude shorter (longer) than
the predicted inhomogeneous dephasing time (gate times). All three relaxation
processes are boosted by (i) the nontrivial valley structure of the
electron-phonon interaction, and (ii) the different valley compositions of the
involved electronic states.

and the one-dimensional bilinear biquadratic model, with the techniques of
density matrix renormalization group theory. Exploiting the tools of quantum
information theory, that is, by studying quantum discord, quantum mutual
information and three recently introduced coherence measures in the reduced
density matrix of two nearest neighbor spins in the bulk, we investigate the
quantum phase transitions and special symmetry points in these models. We point
out the relative strengths and weaknesses of correlation and coherence measures
as figures of merit to witness the quantum phase transitions and symmetry
points in the considered spin-1 Heisenberg chains. In particular, we
demonstrate that as none of the studied measures can detect the infinite order
Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in the XXZ model, they appear to be able to
signal the existence of the same type of transition in the biliear biquadratic
model. However, we argue that what is actually detected by the measures here is
the SU(3) symmetry point of the model rather than the infinite order quantum
phase transition. Moreover, we show in the XXZ model that examining even single
site coherence can be sufficient to spotlight the second-order phase transition
and the SU(2) symmetry point.

a local symmetry strongly constrains the microscopic dynamics. The physics of
such gauge theories is relevant for the understanding of a diverse set of

elementary particles within the standard model. In the last few years, several

  caused by weak measurement</title><description>  Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a trademark of quantum mechanics. In its
original form it states that one cannot gain information about a system without
disturbing it, which is a core of novel cryptographic techniques based on
quantum effects. The principle can be derived from mathematical formalism of
quantum theory. However the formalism itself is very abstract - unlike in
classical mechanics, it does not directly refer to what we perceive. The
question arises: can we derive the principle from more comprehensible
assumptions? Here we derive Heisenberg trade-off from two assumptions:
impossibility of instantaneous messaging at a distance (no-signaling), and
violation of Bell inequalities (non-locality). The former is a natural and
simple assumption, while the latter is an observable phenomenon implied by
quantum mechanics. That the trade-off is a consequence of the above two
assumptions is indirectly implied by existing schemes of secure cryptography
based on the above two assumptions. Surprisingly, despite of vast literature on
such crypto-systems, no direct connection between no-signaling, non-locality
and Heisenberg principle was ever proposed. We also analyze a Bayesian
trade-off, and note that there exists a range of parameters, where assumptions
of no-signaling precisely reconstruct quantum predictions.

fluctuations of the electric field and of the squared electric field in a

flight time variations arise from squared electric field fluctuations, and are
analogous to effects expected when the stress tensor of a quantized field
drives passive spacetime geometry fluctuations. We also discuss the dependence
of the squared electric field fluctuations upon the geometry of the material,
which in turn determines a sampling function for averaging the squared electric

apparatus is not a paradoxical superposition of states but is instead a
non-paradoxical superposition of nonlocal coherent correlations between states:
An un-decayed nucleus is correlated with a live cat, and a decayed nucleus is
correlated with a dead cat. This elucidation of entanglement is demonstrated by
quantum-theoretical analysis and by experiments performed in 1990 using
entangled photon pairs. Thus the cat state does not predict a dead-and-alive
cat. Instead of indefinite superpositions, it predicts mixtures of definite
eigenvalues even though the subsystems are not actually in the corresponding
eigenstates, a situation that implies a (trivial) revision of the standard
eigenvalue-eigenstate rule. Because the subsystem states are not mixed even
though the subsystem eigenvalues are mixed, this analysis avoids two common
objections to such a resolution, namely improper density operators and basis
ambiguity. Thus, entanglement transfers coherence from the superposed quantum
to correlations between the quantum and its measuring apparatus, permitting
instantaneous collapse without interrupting the global unitary evolution. This
resolves a key part of the measurement problem.

of quantum probability theory, started to be widely used in a variety of
applications outside of physics, e.g., cognition and psychology as well as
economy and finances. To distinguish such models from genuine quantum physical
models, they often called quantum-like (although often people simply speak
about, e.g., &quot;quantum cognition&quot;). These novel applications generate a number
of foundational questions. Nowadays we can speak about a new science -
foundations of quantum-like modeling. At the first stage this science was
mainly about comparison of classical and quantum models, mainly in the
probabilistic setting. It was found that statistical data from cognitive
psychology violate some basic constraints posed on data by classical
probability theory (Kolmogorov, 1933); in particular, the constraints given by
the formula of total probability and Bell's type inequalities. Recently another
question attracted some attention. In spite of real success in applications,
there are no reason to believe that the quantum probability would cover
completely all problems of, e.g., cognition. May be more general probability
models have to be explored. A similar problem attracted a lot of attention in
foundations of quantum physics culminating in a series of experiments to check
Sorkin's equality for the triple-slit experiment by Weihs' group. In this note
we present a similar test in the cognitive experimental setting. Performance of
this test would either give further confirmation of the adequacy of the quantum
probability model to cognitive applications or rejection of the conventional
quantum model. Thus this note opens the door for a series of exciting
experimental tests for the quantum-like model of cognition.

generally imply different interaction Hamiltonians V, and therefore different
expectation values for subsystem observables. This means that the uniqueness of
physical predictions is not guaranteed, despite the uniqueness of the total
Hamiltonian H and the total Hilbert space. Here we use Clausius' version of the
second law of thermodynamics (CSL) and standard identifications of
thermodynamic quantities to identify possible subsystem decompositions. It is
shown that agreement with the CSL is obtained, whenever the total Hamiltonian

Not imposing this constraint can result in the transfer of heat from a cooler

by observing the Ramsey-type oscillations of the ion spin states. Three quantum
probes are considered, which are represented by systems obeying the
Jaynes-Cummings, quantum Rabi (in 1D) and Jahn-Teller (in 2D) models. By using
dynamical decoupling schemes in the Jaynes-Cummings and Jahn-Teller models, our
force sensing protocols can be made robust to the spin dephasing caused by the
thermal and magnetic field fluctuations. In the quantum-Rabi probe, the
residual spin-phonon coupling vanishes, which makes this sensing protocol
naturally robust to thermally-induced spin dephasing. We show that the proposed

mechanics as revealed by the Aharonov-Bohm effect for charged particles.
However, till date it is thought that we cannot measure the vector potential
directly as this is not a gauge invariant quantity. Contrary to this belief,
here we show that one can indeed measure the electromagnetic vector potential
using the notion of weak value. We show that it is simply the difference
between the weak value of the canonical momentum of a charged particle in the
presence and absence of magnetic field. This suggests that the vector potential
is not only a physical entity but can be measured directly in the experiment.

ground states of some spin-chain Hamiltonians: the XY model, the Ising model in
a transverse field (ITF) and the XXZ models. In the XY and ITF cases,
entanglement only takes place between states with opposite momenta. Thus, an
anisotropy in the interaction induces entanglement in the momentum pairs. In
the ITF case, the ferromagnetic phase is characterized by a total entropy
between left- and right-moving modes which is independent on the external
field. This result characterizes the Ising phase transition in momentum space.
In the critical XXZ case, we provide evidence that the maximal entropy between
energy modes around the Fermi point grows logarithmically with the system size,
with a prefactor which depends on the compactification radius. The slow growth
of the entanglement in Fourier space with the system size provides an
explanation for the success of the renormalization techniques in momentum

  Products of Graphs</title><description>  The limited connectivity of current and next-generation quantum annealers
motivates the need for efficient graph-minor embedding methods. These methods
allow non-native problems to be adapted to the target annealer's architecture.
The overhead of the widely used heuristic techniques is quickly proving to be a
significant bottleneck for solving real-world applications. To alleviate this
difficulty, we propose a systematic and deterministic embedding method,
exploiting the structures of both the input graph of the specific problem and
the quantum annealer. We focus on the specific case of the Cartesian product of
two complete graphs, a regular structure that occurs in many problems. We
divide the embedding problem by first embedding one of the factors of the
Cartesian product in a repeatable pattern. The resulting simplified problem
consists of the placement and connecting together of these copies to reach a
valid solution. Aside from the obvious advantage of a systematic and
deterministic approach with respect to speed and efficiency, the embeddings
produced are easily scaled for larger processors and show desirable properties
for the number of qubits used and the chain length distribution. To conclude,
we briefly address the problem of circumventing inoperable qubits by presenting
possible extensions of the method.

be expressed in terms of entropic measures. Berta \emph{et al}.
[\href{http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nphys1734}{ Nature Phys. 6, 659

quantum memory by adding an additional term depending on Holevo quantity and
mutual information. We conclude that our lower bound will be tighten with
respect to that of Berta \emph{et al.}, when the accessible information about
measurements outcomes is less than the mutual information of the joint state.
Some examples have been investigated for which our lower bound is tighter than
the Berta's \emph{et al.} lower bound. Using our lower bound, a lower bound for
the entanglement of formation of bipartite quantum states has obtained, as well

makes them one of the best candidates for room temperature single-photon

by state-of-the-art electrically driven epitaxial quantum dots. Since the
electroluminescence mechanism has not yet been elucidated, it is not clear to
what extent the emission rate can be increased. Here we develop a theoretical
framework to study single-photon emission from color centers in diamond under
electrical pumping. The proposed model comprises electron and hole trapping and
releasing, transitions between the ground and excited states of the color
center as well as structural transformations of the center due to carrier
trapping. It provides the possibility to predict both the photon emission rate
and the wavelength of emitted photons. Self-consistent numerical simulations of
the single-photon emitting diode based on the proposed model show that the
photon emission rate can be as high as 100 kcounts s$^{-1}$ at standard
conditions. In contrast to most optoelectronic devices, the emission rate
steadily increases with the device temperature achieving of more than 100
Mcount s$^{-1}$ at 500 K, which is highly advantageous for practical
applications. These results demonstrate the potential of color centers in
diamond as electrically driven non-classical light emitters and provide a

system using the counter-rotating-hybridized rotating-wave (CHRW) method. This
CHRW method treats the driving field and the bias on equal footing by a unitary
transformation with two parameters $\xi$ and $\zeta$, and is nonperturbative in
driving strength, tunneling amplitude or bias. In addition, this CHRW method is
beyond the traditional rotating-wave approximation (Rabi-RWA) and yet by
properly choosing the two parameters $\xi$ and $\zeta$, the transformed
Hamiltonian takes the RWA form with a renormalized energy splitting and a
renormalized driving strength. The reformulated CHRW method possesses the same
mathematical simplicity as the Rabi-RWA approach and thus allows us to
calculate analytically the dynamics and explore explicitly the effect of the
bias. We show that the CHRW method gives the accurate driven dynamics for a
wide range of parameters as compared to the numerically exact results. When
energy scales of the driving are comparable to the intrinsic energy scale of
the two-level systems, the counter-rotating interactions and static bias
profoundly influence the generalized Rabi frequency. In this regime, where
ordinary perturbation approaches fail, the CHRW works very well and
efficiently. We also demonstrate the dynamics of the system in the
strong-driving and off-resonance cases for which the Rabi-RWA method breaks
down but the CHRW method remains valid. We obtain analytical expressions for
the generalized Rabi frequency and bias-modulated Bloch-Siegert shift as
functions of the bias, tunneling and driving field parameters. The CHRW
approach is a mathematically simple and physically clear method. It can be
applied to treat some complicated problems for which a numerical study is
difficult to perform.

computational logics, where meanings of sentences are represented by pieces of
quantum information (generally, density operators of some Hilbert spaces),
which can be stored and transmitted by means of quantum particles. This
approach can be applied to a semantic characterization of epistemic logical
operations, which may occur in sentences like &quot;At time t0 Bob knows that at
time t Alice knows that the spin-value is up&quot;. Each epistemic agent (say,
Alice, Bob,...) has a characteristic truth-perspective, corresponding to a
particular orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space C^2. From a physical point of
view, a truth-perspective can be associated to an apparatus that allows one to
measure a given observable. An important feature that characterizes the
knowledge of any agent is the amount of information that is accessible to
him/her (technically, a special set of density operators, which also represents
the internal memory of the agent in question). One can prove that interesting
epistemic operations are special examples of quantum channels, which generally
are not unitary. The act of knowing may involve some intrinsic irreversibility
due to possible measurement procedures or to a loss of information about the
environment. We also illustrate some relativistic-like effects that arise in
the behavior of epistemic agents.

from the inevitable interaction of the system with its environment. An
efficient method in an extended auxiliary Liouville space is introduced to
describe the dynamics of the non-Markovian open quantum system in the presence

distance between various correlated states after the system state preparation.
These bounds that are much more computable than similar bounds in the

have generally focused on improvements to qubit designs, materials, and system
isolation from environmental perturbations. In the case of the phase degree of
freedom in a quantum superposition, however, the coherence that must be
preserved is ultimately that of the qubit relative to the system clock, rather
than that of the qubit in isolation. In this manuscript we clarify the impact
of clock instability on qubit dephasing and provide quantitative estimates of
fidelity upper-bounds set by noisy phase fluctuations in the clock. We first
indicate analytically that such phase fluctuations in the clock - typically
referred to as the &quot;local oscillator&quot; (LO) - are indistinguishable from a pure
dephasing field arising from other environmental mechanisms. Using these
results, we apply commonly quoted LO phase-noise specifications to calculate
the resultant performance bounds on qubit operational fidelities. We find that
laboratory grade LOs contribute error probabilities beyond $10^{-4}$ for
operation times $&lt;1\;\mu$s, while the use of precision LOs can suppress error
rates by $10^{4}$. We find that in either case phase fluctuations at
frequencies far from the carrier dominate operational error rates, and due to
their high-frequency spectral content, are difficult to mitigate using dynamic
error suppression strategies. Further, we consider the importance of LO noise
bandwidth and its impact on the degree to which thermal phase fluctuations in
the LO contribute an effective error floor. These observations and analysis of
the flow-down effects of such errors on the implementation of benchmarking and
quantum error correction protocols highlight challenges and advantages that
particular qubit technologies possess in the context of phase-noise-induced
errors and motivate enhanced research in precision frequency metrology.

hence the time needed by these protocols provide upper bounds for the total

the process features. We study the survival probability and the transport
efficiency on a simple, highly symmetric graph represented by a ring. The
propagation of excitation is modeled by a discrete-time (coined) quantum walk.
For a two-state quantum walk, where the excitation (walker) has to leave its
actual position to the neighboring sites, the survival probability decays
exponentially and the transport efficiency is unity. The decay rate of the
survival probability can be estimated using the leading eigenvalue of the
evolution operator. However, if the excitation is allowed to stay at its
present position, i.e. the propagation is modeled by a lazy quantum walk, then
part of the wave-packet can be trapped in the vicinity of the origin and never

the excitation transport is not efficient. The dependency of the transport
efficiency on the initial state is determined. Nevertheless, we show that for
some lazy quantum walks dynamical percolations of the ring eliminate the

Heisenberg model and the experimentally measured N\'eel state of
antiferromagnets is studied. To verify the hypothesis [M. I. Katsnelson et al.,
Phys. Rev. B 63, 212404 (2001)] that the latter can be considered to be a
result of local measurements destroying the entanglement of the quantum ground
state, we have performed systematic simulations of the effects of von
Neumannmeasurements for the case of a one-dimensional antiferromagnetic
spin-1/2 system for various types and degrees of magnetic anisotropies. It is
found that in the ground state, a magnetization measurement can create
decoherence waves [M. I. Katsnelson et al. Phys. Rev. A 62, 022118 (2000)] in
the magnetic sublattices, and that a symmetry breaking anisotropy does not lead
to alignment of the spins in a particular direction. However, for an easy-axis
anisotropy of the same order magnitude as the exchange constant, a measurement
on the singlet ground state can create N\'eel-ordering in finite systems of

about stabilizer quantum mechanics. This language has been proved to be
complete in two steps: first in a setting where scalars (diagrams with no

symbol and three additional rules have been added to keep track of scalars.
Here, we introduce a simplified version of the stabilizer ZX-calculus: we give
a smaller set of axioms and prove that meta-rules like `only the topology
matters', `colour symmetry' and `upside-down symmetry', which were considered
as axioms in previous versions of the stabilizer ZX-calculus, can in fact be
derived. In particular, we show that the additional symbol and one of the rules
introduced for proving the completeness of the scalar stabilizer ZX-calculus
are not necessary. We furthermore show that the remaining two rules dedicated

  Quantum Information</title><description>  The remarkable discovery of Quantum Error Correction (QEC), which can
overcome the errors experienced by a bit of quantum information (qubit), was a
critical advance that gives hope for eventually realizing practical quantum
computers. In principle, a system that implements QEC can actually pass a
&quot;break-even&quot; point and preserve quantum information for longer than the
lifetime of its constituent parts. Reaching the break-even point, however, has
thus far remained an outstanding and challenging goal. Several previous works
have demonstrated elements of QEC in NMR, ions, nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers,
photons, and superconducting transmons. However, these works primarily
illustrate the signatures or scaling properties of QEC codes rather than test
the capacity of the system to extend the lifetime of quantum information over
time. Here we demonstrate a QEC system that reaches the break-even point by
suppressing the natural errors due to energy loss for a qubit logically encoded
in superpositions of coherent states, or cat states of a superconducting
resonator. Moreover, the experiment implements a full QEC protocol by using
real-time feedback to encode, monitor naturally occurring errors, decode, and
correct. As measured by full process tomography, the enhanced lifetime of the
encoded information is 320 microseconds without any post-selection. This is 20
times greater than that of the system's transmon, over twice as long as an
uncorrected logical encoding, and 10% longer than the highest quality element
of the system (the resonator's 0, 1 Fock states). Our results illustrate the
power of novel, hardware efficient qubit encodings over traditional QEC
schemes. Furthermore, they advance the field of experimental error correction
from confirming the basic concepts to exploring the metrics that drive system
performance and the challenges in implementing a fault-tolerant system.

teleportation and superdense coding, not the maximally entangled W states but a
special class of non-maximally entangled W-like states are required. Therefore,
efficient preparation of such W-like states is of great importance in quantum
communications, which has not been studied as much as the preparation of W
states. In this letter, we propose a simple optical scheme for efficient
preparation of large-scale polarization based entangled W-like states by fusing
two W-like states or expanding a W-like state with an ancilla photon. Our
scheme can also generate large-scale W states by fusing or expanding W or even
W-like states. The cost analysis show that in generating large scale W states,
the fusion mechanism achieves a higher efficiency with non-maximally entangled
W-like states than maximally entangled W states. Our scheme can also start
fusion or expansion with Bell states, and it is composed of a polarization
dependent beam splitter, two polarizing beam splitters and photon detectors.
Requiring no ancilla photons or controlled gates to operate, our scheme can be
realized with the current photonics technology and we believe it enables
advances in quantum teleportation and superdense coding in multipartite
settings.

difficulties arising from sewing together classical and quantum mechanics:
deterministic operators, weak measurements and post-selection. Weak
Measurement, based on a very weak von Neumann coupling, is a unique kind of
quantum measurement with numerous theoretical and practical applications. In
contrast to other measurement techniques, it allows to gather a small amount of
information regarding the quantum system, with only a negligible probability of
collapsing it. A single weak measurement yields an almost random outcome, but
when performed repeatedly over a large ensemble, the averaged outcome becomes
increasingly robust and accurate. Importantly, a long sequence of weak
measurements can be thought of as a single projective measurement. I claim in
this work that classical variables appearing in the macro-world, such as centre
of mass, moment of inertia, pressure and average forces, result from a
multitude of quantum weak measurements performed in the micro-world. Here
again, the quantum outcomes are highly uncertain, but the law of large numbers
obliges their convergence to the definite quantities we know from our everyday
lives. By augmenting this description with a final boundary condition and
employing the notion of &quot;classical robustness under time-reversal&quot; I will draw
a quantitative borderline between the classical and quantum regimes. I will
conclude by analyzing the role of macroscopic systems in amplifying and

quantum many-body system. We consider the open Dicke model, describing the
infinite-range interactions between $N$ atoms and a single, lossy
electromagnetic mode. We show that the dynamical phase transition at a critical
atom-light coupling is characterized by the interplay between reservoir-driven
and intrinsic relaxation processes. Above the critical coupling, small
fluctuations in the occupation of the dominant quasi-particle-mode start to
grow in time while the quasi-particle lifetime remains finite due to losses.
Near the critical interaction strength we observe a crossover between
exponential and power-law $1/\tau$ relaxation, the latter driven by collisions
between quasi-particles. For a quench exactly to the critical coupling, the
power-law relaxation extends to infinite times, but the finite lifetime of
quasi-particles prevents ageing to appear. We predict our results to be
accessible to quench experiments with ultracold bosons in optical resonators.

  gradient frequency comb</title><description>  Gradient echo memory (GEM) stores and retrieves photon wave packet in forward
direction with high efficiency and fidelity using photon-echo mechanism. It is
an important technique for quantum memory applications. By breaking the
continuity of the gradient absorption structure, the scheme becomes gradient
frequency comb (GFC), which is a hybrid of GEM and atomic frequency comb (AFC).
To elucidate the non-trivial field-atom evolution of gradient echo, we derive
its exact analytical solution in a medium of arbitrary optical thickness
subjecting to any linear gradient of transition frequency, and discuss its
physical processes. Based on this solution, we further suggest and analysis two
types of GFC, one with stepwise gradient and the other with discontinuous
gradient.

  adjoint master equation and applications</title><description>  Open quantum system theory is fundamental for a proper description of quantum
systems in different contexts such as chemistry, condensed matter physics,
bio-physics and opto-mechamics. Quantum brownian motion which is analytically
described by the Hu-Paz-Zhang (HPZ) model represents one of the most important
examples of an open quantum system. In this paper we propose a novel derivation
of its master equation, based on the Heisenberg picture. We provide an exact
and analytic equation both for the operators as well as for the states. The
result, equivalent to the one derived originally by HPZ, is expressed in terms
of the spectral density, regardless the strength of the coupling between the
system and the environment and allows to compute the time evolution of
physically relevant quantities in a much easier way, since it is directly
expressed in terms of the spectral density. An example is explicitly studied.

  optomechanics</title><description>  Isolation of a system from its environment is often desirable; however,
dissipation can also be a useful resource. Remarkably, engineered dissipation
enables the preparation and stabilization of quantum states of atoms, ions or
superconducting qubits. This is achieved by a suitably engineered coupling to a
dissipative cold reservoir formed by electromagnetic modes. Similarly, in the
field of cavity electro- and optomechanics the control over mechanical
oscillators utilizes the inherently cold dissipative nature of the
electromagnetic degree of freedom. Breaking from this paradigm, recent
theoretical work has considered the opposite regime in which the dissipation of
the mechanical oscillator dominates and provides a cold dissipative reservoir
to the electromagnetic mode. Here we report the experimental realization of
this reversed dissipation regime in a microwave cavity optomechanical system
and realize a quasi-instantaneous, cold reservoir for microwave light. We
evidence this regime by decreasing or increasing the damping rate of the cavity
on demand, that corresponds to amplification and de-amplification of the
microwave field. Additionally, we observe the onset of parametric instability,
i.e. the stimulated emission of microwaves (masing). Moreover, we employ the
engineered cold reservoir to implement a low-noise, large-gain phase-preserving
amplifier. Beyond offering the manipulation of microwave fields, such a
dissipative reservoir for microwave light, when coupled to multiple cavity
modes, forms the basis of microwave entanglement schemes, electromechanical
amplifiers with unlimited gain-bandwidth product and dissipative quantum phase
transitions. Equally important, combining such reservoir-mediated interaction
with coherent dynamics allows for the realization of non-reciprocal devices,
which would extend the available toolbox of quantum-limited microwave
manipulation techniques.

constraints (GPCs) has recently been provided in [PRL 110, 040404]: Natural
occupation numbers $\vec{\lambda}\equiv (\lambda_i)$ of the ground state of a
model system in the regime of weak couplings $\kappa$ of three spinless
fermions in one spatial dimension were found extremely close, in a distance
$D_{min}\sim \kappa^8$ to the boundary of the allowed region. We provide a
self-contained and complete study of this quasipinning phenomenon. In
particular, we develop tools for its systematic exploration and quantification.
We confirm that quasipinning in one dimension occurs also for larger particle
numbers and extends to intermediate coupling strengths, but vanishes for very
strong couplings. We further explore the non-triviality of our findings by
comparing quasipinning by GPCs to potential quasipinning by the less
restrictive Pauli exclusion principle constraints. This allows us to eventually
confirm the significance of GPCs beyond Pauli's exclusion principle.

fields on various semiconductor platforms. We explicitly show how to perform
faster gate operations by going beyond the universally-used rotating wave
approximation (RWA) regime, while using only two sinusoidal pulses. No
complicated pulse shaping or optimal control sequences are required. We first
show for specific published experiments how much error is currently incurred by
implementing pulses designed using standard RWA. We then show that an even
modest increase in gate speed would cause problems in using RWA for gate design
in the singlet-triplet (ST) and resonant-exchange (RX) qubits. We discuss the
extent to which analytically keeping higher orders in the perturbation theory
would address the problem. More strikingly, we give a new prescription for
gating with strong coupling far beyond the RWA regime. We perform numerical
calculations for the phases and the durations of two consecutive pulses to
realize the key Hadamard and $\frac{\pi}{8}$ gates with coupling strengths up
to several times the qubit splitting. Working in this manifestly non-RWA
regime, the gate operation speeds up by two to three orders of magnitude.

is defined as the smallest number of pure product states having $\r$ as their
mixture. The length filtration of the set of separable states, $\cS$, is the
increasing chain $\emptyset\subset\cS'_1\subseteq\cS'_2\subseteq\cdots$, where
$\cS'_i=\{\r\in\cS:L(\r)\le i\}$. We define the maximum length, $L_{\rm
max}=\max_{\r\in\cS} L(\r)$, critical length, $L_{\rm crit}$, and yet another
special length, $L_c$, which was defined by a simple formula in one of our
previous papers. The critical length indicates the first term in the length
filtrartion whose dimension is equal to $\dim\cS$. We show that in general
$d\le L_c\le L_{\rm crit}\le L_{\rm max}\le d^2$.
  We conjecture that the equality $L_{\rm crit}=L_c$ holds for all
finite-dimensional multipartite quantum systems. Our main result is that
$L_{\rm crit}=L_c$ for the bipartite systems having a single qubit as one of
the parties. This is accomplished by computing the rank of the Jacobian matrix
of a suitable map having $\cS$ as its range.

modeling the dynamics of skewed rogue waves emerging in the vicinity of a wave
blocking point due to opposing current. The equation we propose is a KEE with
an additional potential term therefore the results presented in this paper can
easily be generalized to study the quantum tunneling properties of the rogue
waves and ultrashort (femtosecond) pulses of the KEE. In the frame of the
extended KEE, we numerically show that the chaotic perturbations of the ocean
current trigger the occurrence of the rogue waves on the ocean surface. We
propose and implement a split-step scheme and show that the extended KEE that
we propose is unstable against random chaotic perturbations in the current
profile. These perturbations transform the monochromatic wave field into a
chaotic sea state with many peaks. We numerically show that the shapes of rogue
waves due to perturbations in the current profile closely follow the form of
rational rogue wave solutions, especially for the central peak. We also discuss
the effects of magnitude of the chaotic current perturbations on the statistics
of the rogue wave occurrence.

of a suspended mirror using laser light, the quantum noise in the measurement
of the angular motion of a suspended mirror has not been investigated
intensively despite its potential importance. In this letter, an expression for
the quantum noise in the angular motion measurement is explicitly derived. The
expression indicates that one quadrature of the vacuum field of the first-order
Hermite-Gaussian mode of light causes quantum sensing noise and the other
causes quantum backaction noise, or in other words the first-order vacuum field
is ponderomotively squeezed. It is also shown that the Gouy phase shift the
light acquires between the mirror and the position of detection of the light
corresponds to the homodyne angle. Therefore, the quantum backaction noise can
be cancelled and the standard quantum limit can be surpassed by choosing the
appropriate position of detection analogously to the cancellation of quantum
radiation pressure noise by choosing an appropriate homodyne angle.

initially kept separated at different temperatures, and later connected and let

halves, we highlight, through bosonisation and time-dependent
matrix-product-state simulations, the different contributions of low-lying
bosonic modes and of fermionic quasi-particles to the energy transport. In the
simulations we also observe that the energy current reaches a finite value
which only slowly decays to zero. The general pictures that emerges is the
following. Since integrability is only locally broken in this model, a
pre-equilibration behaviour may appear. In particular, when the sound
velocities of the bosonic modes of the two halves match, the low-temperature
energy current is almost stationary and described by a formula with a
non-universal prefactor interpreted as a transmission coefficient.
Thermalisation, characterized by the absence of any energy flow, occurs only on
longer time-scales which are not accessible with our numerics.

ontic approach to inter-theoretic relationships. Our stance stresses the fact
that physical theories require the necessary consideration of a conceptual
level of discourse which determines and configures the specific field of
phenomena discussed by each particular theory. We will criticize the orthodox
line of research which has grounded the analysis about QM in two (Bohrian)
metaphysical presuppositions -accepted in the present as dogmas that all
interpretations must follow. We will also examine how the orthodox project of
&quot;bridging the gap&quot; between the quantum and the classical domains has
constrained the possibilities of research, producing only a limited set of
interpretational problems which only focus in the justification of &quot;classical
reality&quot; and exclude the possibility of analyzing the possibilities of
non-classical conceptual representations of QM. The representational realist
stance introduces two new problems, namely, the superposition problem and the
contextuality problem, which consider explicitly the conceptual representation
of orthodox QM beyond the mere reference to mathematical structures and
measurement outcomes. In the final part of the paper, we revisit, from a
representational realist perspective, the quantum to classical limit and the
orthodox claim that this inter-theoretic relation can be explained through the
principle of decoherence.

the classical limits imposed on precision in the canonical phase estimation
scenario. First, we prove that random pure states drawn from the Hilbert space
of distinguishable particles typically do not lead to super-classical scaling
of precision even when allowing for local unitary optimization. Conversely, we
show that random states from the symmetric subspace typically achieve the
optimal Heisenberg scaling without the need for local unitary optimization.
Surprisingly, the Heisenberg scaling is observed for states of arbitrarily low
purity and preserved under finite particle losses. Moreover, we prove that for
such states a standard photon-counting interferometric measurement suffices to
typically achieve the Heisenberg scaling of precision for all possible values
of the phase at the same time. Finally, we demonstrate that metrologically
useful states can be prepared with short random optical circuits generated from
three types of beam-splitters and a non-linear (Kerr-like) transformation.

that maximizes the nonlocality of correlations with respect to some suitable
measure such as the violation of Bell inequalities. The latter has however some
drawbacks. First and foremost it is unfeasible to determine the whole set of
Bell inequalities already for a few measurements and thus unfeasible to find
the experimental setup maximizing their violation. Second, the Bell violation
suffers from an ambiguity stemming from the choice of the normalization of the
Bell coefficients. An alternative measure of nonlocality with a direct
information-theoretic interpretation is the minimal amount of classical
communication required for simulating nonlocal correlations. In the case of
many instances simulated in parallel, the minimal communication cost per
instance is called nonlocal capacity, and its computation can be reduced to a
convex-optimization problem. This quantity can be computed for a higher number
of measurements and turns out to be useful for finding the optimal experimental
setup. Focusing on the bipartite case, in this paper, we present a simple
method for maximizing the nonlocal capacity over a given configuration space
and, in particular, over a set of possible measurements, yielding the
corresponding optimal setup. Furthermore, we show that there is a functional
relationship between Bell violation and nonlocal capacity. The method is
illustrated with numerical tests and compared with the maximization of the
violation of CGLMP-type Bell inequalities on the basis of entangled two-qubit
as well as two-qutrit states. Remarkably, the anomaly of nonlocality displayed
by qutrits turns out to be even stronger if the nonlocal capacity is employed
as a measure of nonlocality.

with real energy eigenvalues and the other with complex conjugate eigenvalues.
To enter one phase from the other, it is believed that the system must pass
through an exceptional point, which is a non-Hermitian degenerate point with
coalesced eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In this letter we reveal an anomalous
PT transition that takes place away from an exceptional point in a nonlinear
system: as the nonlinearity increases, the original linear system evolves along
two distinct PT-symmetric trajectories, each of which can have an exceptional
point. However, the two trajectories collide and vanish away from these
exceptional points, after which the system is left with a PT-broken phase. We
first illustrate this phenomenon using a coupled mode theory and then exemplify
it using paraxial wave propagation in a transverse periodic potential.

resonator which is typically formed from a solid object. The range of phenomena
accessible to these systems depends on the properties of the mechanical
resonator and on the manner in which it couples to the cavity fields. In both
respects, a mechanical resonator formed from superfluid liquid helium offers
several appealing features: low electromagnetic absorption, high thermal
conductivity, vanishing viscosity, well-understood mechanical loss, and in situ
alignment with cryogenic cavities. In addition, it offers degrees of freedom
that differ qualitatively from those of a solid. Here, we describe an
optomechanical system consisting of a miniature optical cavity filled with
superfluid helium. The cavity mirrors define optical and mechanical modes with
near-perfect overlap, resulting in an optomechanical coupling rate ~3 kHz. This
coupling is used to drive the superfluid; it is also used to observe the
superfluid's thermal motion, resolving a mean phonon number as low as 11.

connection to quantum information processing. It has been shown that the
Yang-Baxter equation is closely related to quantum entanglement and quantum

interferometric setup. Our experiment was performed on a liquid state
Iodotrifluoroethylene sample which contains molecules with three qubits. We use
Controlled-transfer gates that allow us to build a pseudo-pure state from which
we are able to apply a quantum information protocol that implements the

dinaphtho[2,3-b:2'3'-f]thieno[3,2-b]-thiophene (DNTT) thin films provided

dynamics of the DNTT thin films by combining ab initio calculations and a
stochastic Schrodinger equation. Our theory predicts that the low-energy
Frenkel exciton band consists of 8 to 47% CT character. The quantum dynamics
simulations show coherent dynamics of Frenkel and CT states in 50 fs after the
optical excitation. We demonstrate the role of charge delocalization and

and may be considered as low-frequency filters. In this work, we perform a
comprehensive theoretical study of the response of a type of dynamically

realistic $1/f$ noises with frequency spectra $1/\omega^\alpha$. Through
randomized benchmarking, we have found that {\sc supcode} offers improvement of
the gate fidelity for $\alpha\gtrsim1$ and the improvement becomes
exponentially more pronounced with the increase of the noise exponent in the
range $1\lesssim\alpha\leq3$ studied. On the other hand, for small $\alpha$,
{\sc supcode} will not offer any improvement. The $\delta J$-{\sc supcode},
specifically designed for systems where the nuclear noise is absent, is found
to offer additional error reduction than the full {\sc supcode} for charge
noises. The computed filter transfer functions of the {\sc supcode} gates are

constrained by resources such as computer memory. Recent theoretical work shows
quantum theory can reduce this memory requirement beyond ultimate classical

0.05 $\pm$ 0.01, far below the ultimate classical limit of C = 1. Scaling up
this technique would substantially reduce the memory required in simulation of

We construct a new kind of hybrid interferometer based on the atom-light

particular, we investigate systems whose relaxation dynamics is described by a
Lindblad master equation. We find that the universal scaling behavior not only
exhibits in the equilibrium stage at the long-time limit, but also manifests
itself in the non-equilibrium relaxation process. While the critical behavior
is dictated by the low-lying energy levels of the Hamiltonian, the dissipative
part in the Lindblad equation also plays important roles in two aspects: First,
the dissipative part makes the high energy levels decay fast after which the
universal behavior controlled by the low-lying modes emerges. Second, the
dissipation rate gives rise to a time scale that affects the scaling behavior.
We confirm our theory by solving the Lindblad equation for the one-dimensional

observed data as precisely as possible, which usually requires a considerable
effort. One is, however, often not interested in all the details of the fully
estimated state. Rather, one needs to know one or a few properties of the state
such as, for example, its fidelity with a target state or the degree of
correlation for a specific bipartite structure. Since the best guess for a
particular property is, typically, not equal to its value in the best-guess
state, it is preferable to directly estimate the properties of interest from
the recorded data --- and, in fact, this is possible.
  As a natural and meaningful way of stating the accuracy of the estimated
property values, we propose the use of optimal error intervals, which are
immediate analogs of the optimal error regions for quantum state estimation
[see New J. Phys. 15, 123026 (2013)]. They are optimal in two ways: They have
the largest likelihood for the observed data and the pre-chosen size (=prior
content), and are smallest for the pre-chosen credibility (=posterior content).
Quite generally, the optimal error intervals are easily characterized by the
likelihood for the data conditioned on the values of the properties of
interest.
  We report an iterative algorithm for the computation of this marginal
likelihood. The step that is most costly (in CPU time) is the sampling, for the
purpose of Monte Carlo integration, of the quantum state space in accordance
with a sequence of prior densities. We illustrate the concepts and methods by
identifying the optimal error intervals for the fidelity and purity of
single-qubit states, as well as the CHSH quantity for two-qubit states, both
for pre-chosen observables and for a state-dependent optimized choice of
observables.

degrees of freedom. The theory for bosons with internal degrees of freedom
constitutes a generalization of the MCTDHB method that substantially enriches
the many-body physics that can be described. We demonstrate that the
numerically exact solution of the time-dependent many-body Schr\&quot;odinger
equation for interacting bosonic particles with internal degrees of freedom is
now feasible. We report on the MCTDHB equations of motion for bosons with
internal degrees of freedom and their implementation for a general many-body
Hamiltonian with one-body and two-body terms that, both, may depend on the
internal states of the considered particles. To demonstrate the capabilities of
the theory and its software implementation integrated in the MCTDH-X software,
we apply MCTDHB to the emergence of fragmentation of parabolically trapped
bosons with two internal states: we study the groundstate of $N=100$
parabolically confined bosons as a function of the splitting between the
state-dependent minima of the two parabolic potentials. To quantify the
coherence of the system we compute its normalized one-body correlation
function. We find that the coherence within each internal state of the atoms is
maintained, while it is lost between the different internal states. This is a
hallmark of a new kind of fragmentation which is absent in bosons without
internal structure. We term the emergent phenomenon &quot;composite fragmentation&quot;.

feedback can be used to improve the visibility of quantum correlations in the
interferometric position measurement of a mechanical oscillator. The oscillator
is formed by a radio-frequency nanostring and the &quot;meter&quot; is an optical field
in a microcavity-based interferometer. Back-action imparted by the meter, due
to radiation pressure quantum noise, gives rise to correlations between its
phase and amplitude quadratures. We probe these correlations as motional
sideband asymmetry at the output of a heterodyne detector operating with an
imprecision far below that at the standard quantum limit. The challenge is to
discern a phonon-equivalent asymmetry of $1$ --- arising from
imprecision-back-action correlations --- atop a thermal occupation of $\sim
10^4$. Towards this end, we use derivative feedback of an auxiliary homodyne
measurement to cool the oscillator to a thermal occupation of 15, thereby
increasing the visibility of the asymmetry to $6\%$. At higher feedback gains,
the homodyne signal is `squashed' and the visibility of sideband asymmetry is
reduced. This is due to the feedback of vacuum noise from the homodyne

cryptography. This motivated the cryptographic community to search for
quantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on
secret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider
attacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic
primitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives a
lot of power to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless
possible to build secure cryptosystems in it.
  We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the
simplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric
cryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we
show that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be
dramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires
$\Omega(2^{n/2})$ queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen
with some hidden periodicity, they can be found with only $O(n)$ queries in the
quantum model.
  We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most
widely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption
e.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security
model. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ,
COPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the
situation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are

noise to directly produce video recordings of double-slit interference at the
photon-by-photon level, because readout noise significantly contaminates or
overwhelms the signal. In this work, noise levels are significantly reduced by
turning on the camera only when the presence of a photon has been heralded by
the arrival, at an independent detector, of a time-correlated photon produced
via parametric down-conversion. This triggering scheme provides the improvement
required for direct video imaging of Young's double-slit experiment with single
photons, allowing clarified versions of this foundational demonstration.
Further, we introduce variations on this experiment aimed at promoting
discussion of the role spatial coherence plays in such a measurement. We also
emphasize complementary aspects of single-photon measurement, where imaging
yields (transverse) position information, while diffraction yields the
transverse momentum, and highlight the roles of transverse position and
momentum correlations between down-converted photons, including examples of
&quot;ghost&quot; imaging and diffraction. The videos can be accessed at

  grand canonical approach</title><description>  The grand canonical formalism is employed to study the thermodynamic
structure of a model displaying a quantum phase transition when studied with
respect to the canonical formalism. A numerical survey shows that the grand
partition function diverges following a power law when the interaction
parameter approaches a limiting constant. The power-law exponent takes a
distinctive value when such limiting constant coincides with the critical point
of the subjacent quantum phase transition. An approximated expression for the
grand partition function is derived analytically implementing a mean field
scheme and a number of thermodynamic observables are obtained. The system
observables show signatures that can be used to track the critical point of the
underlying transition. This result provides a simple fact that can be exploited
to verify the existence of a quantum phase transition avoiding the zero
temperature regime.

metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology hamper the performance and
scalability prospects of field-effect transistors. However, those quantum
effects, such as tunnelling and coherence, can be harnessed to use existing
CMOS technology for quantum information processing. Here, we report the
observation of coherent charge oscillations in a double quantum dot formed in a
silicon nanowire transistor detected via its dispersive interaction with a
radio-frequency resonant circuit coupled via the gate. Differential capacitance
changes at the inter-dot charge transitions allow us to monitor the state of
the system in the strong-driving regime where we observe the emergence of
Landau-Zener-St{\&quot;u}ckelberg-Majorana interference on the phase response of the
resonator. A theoretical analysis of the dispersive signal demonstrates that
quantum and tunnelling capacitance changes must be included to describe the
qubit-resonator interaction. Furthermore, a Fourier analysis of the
interference pattern reveals a charge coherence time, $T_2\approx 100$~ps. Our
results demonstrate charge coherent control and readout in a simple silicon
transistor and open up the possibility to implement charge and spin qubits in
existing CMOS technology.

by linear constraints called Bell inequalities. It is much harder to
characterise the boundary of the quantum set itself in the space of
no-signaling correlations. For the points on the quantum boundary that violate
maximally some Bell inequalities, Oppenheim and Wehner [Science 330, 1072
(2010)] pointed out a complex property: the optimal measurements of Alice steer
Bob's local state to the eigenstate of an effective operator corresponding to
its maximal eigenvalue. This effective operator is the linear combination of
Bob's local operators induced by the coefficients of the Bell inequality, and
it can be interpreted as defining a fine-grained uncertainty relation. It is
natural to ask whether the same property holds for other points on the quantum
boundary, using the Bell expression that defines the tangent hyperplane at each
point. We prove that this is indeed the case for a large set of points,
including some that were believed to provide counterexamples. The price to pay
is to acknowledge that the Oppenheim-Wehner criterion does not respect
equivalence under the no-signaling constraint: for each point, one has to look
for specific forms of writing the Bell expressions.

non-commutative geometry can be projected into either of two Abelian spaces,
so-called `shadow phase spaces'. One of these is the phase space of Bohmian

by a single measurement is given. Distinguishability is to be understood as
possibility of an unambiguous measurement. For finite number of states, it is
known that the necessary and sufficient condition of distinguishability is that
the states are linearly independent. For infinite number of states, several
natural classes of distinguishability can be defined. We give a necessary and
sufficient condition for a system of pure states to be distinguishable. It
turns out that each level of distinguishability naturally corresponds to one of
the generalizations of linear independence to families of infinite vectors. As
an important example, we apply the general theory to von Neumann's lattice, a
subsystem of coherent states which corresponds to a lattice in the classical
phase space. We prove that the condition for distinguishability is that the
area of the fundamental region of the lattice is greater than the Planck
constant, and also find subtle behavior on the threshold. These facts reveal
the measurement theoretical meaning of the Planck constant and give a
justification for the interpretation that it is the smallest unit of area in
the phase space. The cases of uncountably many states and of mixed states are
also discussed.

by Englert, Scully, S\&quot;ussmann and Walther [ESSW], and others, have formed a
rich area for investigating the puzzling behaviour of particles undergoing
quantum interference. The surprise provided by the original delayed choice
experiment, led Wheeler to the conclusion that &quot;no phenomenon is a phenomenon
until it is an observed phenomenon&quot;, a radical explanation which implied that
&quot;the past has no existence except as it is recorded in the present&quot;. However
Bohm, Dewdney and Hiley have shown that the Bohm interpretation gives a
straightforward account of the behaviour of the particle without resorting to
such a radical explanation. The subsequent modifications of this experiment led
both Aharonov and Vaidman and [ESSW] to conclude that the resulting Bohm-type
trajectories in these new situations produce unacceptable properties. For
example, if a cavity is placed in one arm of the interferometer, it will be
excited by a particle travelling down the {\em other} arm. In other words it is
the particle that does {\em not} go through the cavity that gives up its
energy! If this analysis is correct, this behaviour would be truly bizarre and
could only be explained by an extreme non-local transfer of energy that is even
stronger than that required in an EPR-type processes. In this paper we show
that this conclusion is not correct and that if the Bohm interpretation is used
correctly, it gives a {\em local} explanation, which actually corresponds
exactly to the standard quantum mechanics explanation offered by Englert,
Scully, S\&quot;ussmann and Walther [ESSW].

formulas for singular controls, which are candidates for landscape traps, are
compared to their analogues in the dipole approximation. A numerical analysis
of the existence of traps in control landscapes beyond the dipole approximation
is made in the four level case. A numerical exploration of these control
landscapes is achieved by generating many random Hamiltonians which include a

classical and quantum noise statistics, with analytical expressions emerging
when all dephasing sources are Gaussian. This exact characterization is used to
establish two main results. First, we construct multi-qubit sequences that
ensure maximum high-order error suppression in both the time and frequency
domain and that can be exponentially more efficient than existing ones in terms

achieved by meeting appropriate conditions for the emergence of a fidelity
plateau under sequence repetition, thereby generalizing recent results for
single-qubit memory under Gaussian dephasing. In both scenarios, the key step

atoms has remained a long standing goal, opening the path towards the study of
fundamentally new quantum many-body systems including frustrated or topological
magnets and supersolids. Optical dressing of ground state atoms by
near-resonant laser coupling to Rydberg states has been proposed as a versatile
method to engineer such interactions. However, up to now the great potential of
this approach for interaction control in a many-body setting has eluded
experimental confirmation. Here we report the realisation of coherent
Rydberg-dressing in an ultracold atomic lattice gas and directly probe the
induced interaction potential using an interferometric technique with single
atom sensitivity. We use this approach to implement a two-dimensional synthetic
spin lattice and demonstrate its versatility by tuning the range and anisotropy
of the effective spin interactions. Our measurements are in remarkable
agreement with exact solutions of the many-body dynamics, providing further
evidence for the high degree of accurate interaction control in these systems.
Finally, we identify a collective many-body decay process, and discuss possible

second derivative coupling term in the adiabatic representation, and it can
have an arbitrary large magnitude when a gap between neighbouring
Born-Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surfaces (PESs) is closing.
Nevertheless, DBOC is typically neglected in mixed quantum-classical methods of
simulating nonadiabatic dynamics (e.g., fewest-switch surface hopping (FSSH)
method). A straightforward addition of DBOC to BO PESs in the FSSH method,
FSSH+D, has been shown to lead to numerically much inferior results for models
containing conical intersections. More sophisticated variation of the DBOC
inclusion, phase-space surface-hopping (PSSH) was more successful than FSSH+D
but on model problems without conical intersections. This work comprehensively
assesses the role of DBOC in nonadiabatic dynamics of two electronic state
problems and the performance of FSSH, FSSH+D, and PSSH methods in variety of
one- and two-dimensional models. Our results show that the inclusion of DBOC
can enhance the accuracy of surface hopping simulations when two conditions are
simultaneously satisfied: 1) nuclei have kinetic energy lower than DBOC and 2)
PESs are not strongly nonadiabatically coupled. The inclusion of DBOC is
detrimental in situations where its energy scale becomes very high or even
diverges, because in these regions PESs are also very strongly coupled. In this
case, the true quantum formalism heavily relies on an interplay between
diagonal and off-diagonal nonadiabatic couplings while surface hopping
approaches treat diagonal terms as PESs and off-diagonal ones stochastically.

We show the behavior of QFI per particle of the system due to changes of re-

for a charged particle. The present idea allows the acceleration of both the
amplitude and phase of the wave function throughout the fast-forward time range
and is distinct from that of Masuda-Nakamura (e.g., Proc. R. Soc. A {\bf 466},
1135 (2010)) which enabled acceleration of only the amplitude of the wave
function on the way. We shall apply the proposed method to the quantum
tunneling phenomena and obtain the electro-magnetic field to ensure the rapid
penetration of wave functions through a tunneling barrier. Typical examples
described here are: 1) an exponential wave packet passing through the
delta-function barrier; 2) the opened Moshinsky shutter with a delta-function
barrier just behind the shutter. We elucidate the tunneling current in the
vicinity of the barrier and find the remarkable enhancement of the tunneling
rate (: tunneling power) due to the fast-forwarding. In the case of a very high
barrier, in particular, we present the asymptotic analysis and exhibit a
suitable driving force to recover a recognizable tunneling current. The
analysis is also carried out on the exact acceleration of macroscopic quantum
tunneling with use of the nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger equation which accommodates a
tunneling barrier.

  Discounted Mean Square Cost Functionals and Penalized Back-action</title><description>  This paper is concerned with quantum harmonic oscillators consisting of a
quantum plant and a directly coupled coherent quantum observer. We employ
discounted quadratic performance criteria in the form of exponentially weighted
time averages of second-order moments of the system variables. A coherent
quantum filtering (CQF) problem is formulated as the minimization of the
discounted mean square of an estimation error, with which the dynamic variables
of the observer approximate those of the plant. The cost functional also
involves a quadratic penalty on the plant-observer coupling matrix in order to
mitigate the back-action of the observer on the covariance dynamics of the
plant. For the discounted mean square optimal CQF problem with penalized
back-action, we establish first-order necessary conditions of optimality in the
form of algebraic matrix equations. By using the Hamiltonian structure of the
Heisenberg dynamics and related Lie-algebraic techniques, we represent this set
of equations in a more explicit form in the case of equally dimensioned plant
and observer.

combination of the modular S-matrix elements known as anyon monodromy scalar.
Next, in the explicit setup of a $SU(N)_k$ WZW model, we compare the late time
behaviour of the out-of-time correlators and the purity. Interestingly, in the
large-c limit, the purity grows logarithmically but the out-of-time-order

  dissipative spin systems</title><description>  We show that short-range correlations have a dramatic impact on the
steady-state phase diagram of quantum driven-dissipative systems. This effect,
never observed in equilibrium, follows from the fact that ordering in the
steady state is of dynamical origin, and is established only at very long time,
whereas in thermodynamic equilibrium it arises from the properties of the
(free-)energy. Tiny correlations may be amplified in the dynamics and therefore
have a strong impact in the steady state. To this scope, by combining the
cluster methods extensively used in equilibrium phase transitions to quantum
trajectories and tensor-network techniques, we extend them to non-equilibrium
phase transitions in dissipative many-body systems. We analyze in detail a
model of spins-1/2 on a lattice interacting through an XYZ Hamiltonian, each of
them coupled to an independent environment which induces incoherent spin flips.
In the steady-state phase diagram derived from our cluster approach, the
location of the phase boundaries and even its topology radically change,
introducing re-entrance of the paramagnetic phase as compared to the
single-site mean field where correlations are neglected. Furthermore a
stability analysis of the cluster mean-field indicates a susceptibility towards
a possible incommensurate ordering, not present if short-range correlations are
ignored.

  quantum devices</title><description>  From a quantum point of view, it is mandatory to include the measurement
process when predicting the time-evolution of a quantum system. In this paper,
a model to treat the measurement of the (TeraHertz) THz electrical current in
quantum devices is presented. The explicit interaction of a quantum system with
an external measuring apparatus is analyzed through the unambiguous notion of
the Bohmian conditional wave function, the wave function of a subsystem. It it
shown that such THz quantum measurement process can be modeled as a weak
measurement: The systems suffers a small perturbation due to the apparatus, but
the current is measured with a great uncertainty. This uncertainty implies that
a new source of noise appears at THz frequencies. Numerical (quantum Monte
Carlo) experiments are performed confirming the weak character of this
measurement. This work also indicates that at low frequencies this noise is
negligible and it can be ignored. From a classical point of view, the origin of
this noise due to the measurement at THz frequencies can be attributed to the
plasmonic effect of those electrons at the contacts (by interpreting the
contacts themselves as part of the measuring apparatus).

described by Quantum Mechanics. Notwithstanding the success of that
quantitative description, various aspects of observations, as nonlocality and
the statistical randomness of results, remain as mysterious properties apart
from the quantum theory, and they are attributed to the strangeness of the
microscopic world. Here we restart from the fundamental relations of
uncertainty to reformulate the probability law of Born including the temporal
variable. Considering that both the spatial and the temporal variables play a
symmetric role in the wave-function \Psi (x,t) , a temporal wavepacket is built
and analysed. The probability density is written as p(x,t) = | \Psi (x,t) |^2,
where the probabilistic interpretation for the temporal wavepacket is
equivalent to Born's law for the spatial variable, x. For the convenience of
the discussion of the role of the temporal variable, we write p(x_0,t) = | \Psi
(x_0,t) |^2 for a free particle, expressing only the temporal wavepacket, then
we discuss its spread. In the light of the evolution of this temporal
wavepacket we analyse basic processes of matter-wave interaction, involving
single and entangled entities. Nonlocality appears then as a consequence of the
spread of the temporal wavepacket; and the position of each detected event in
two-slits interferometry as due to the independent phases of the spatial and
temporal wavepackets.

the QDs are integrated in a cross-section of a semiconductor core wire which is
surrounded by an amorphous straining shell. Detailed numerical simulations show
that, thanks to the mechanical isotropy of the shell, the strain field in a

slope. This calibration technique is applied to self-assembled InAs QDs
submitted to incremental tensile strain along their growth axis. In contrast to
recent studies conducted on similar QDs stressed perpendicularly to their

a moderate dispersion. These results highlight the importance of the stress
direction to optimise QD response to applied strain, with implications both in
static and dynamic regimes. As such, they are in particular relevant for the
development of wavelength-tunable single photon sources or hybrid QD

This spookiness is more than just because quantum mechanics doesn't match

preserve a form of deterministic thinking that can alleviate some of the

signals the occurrence of irreversibility. Quantifying the amount of
irreversible entropy produced is a goal of paramount importance: it is a key
quantity for the characterisation of non-equilibrium processes, and its
minimisation improves the efficiency of thermal machines. So far, nanoscale
systems have been used for the experimental study of classical
out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics. However, irreversible entropy production
arising from quantum dynamics in mesoscopic quantum systems has not been
experimentally investigated yet. In this work we measure the rate of entropy
produced by an open quantum system in a non-equilibrium steady state for two
different experimental setups: a micro-mechanical resonator and a Bose-Einstein
condensate. Each of them is coupled to a high finesse cavity and hence subject
also to optical losses. We find excellent agreement between the experimental
data and the predictions of a framework that we develop for the open dynamics
of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators. Key features of our setups, such as
the cooling of the mechanical resonator and signatures of a structural quantum
phase transition in the condensate are reflected in the entropy production
rates. Our work demonstrates the possibility to explore non-equilibrium
thermodynamics in driven mesoscopic quantum systems, and paves the way to a
systematic experimental assessment of the implications of out-of-equilibrium

we establish a criterion of physical consistency for any resource theory in
terms of physical implementation of the free operations, and we show that all

structure sheds new light on the old debate on whether space and time are to be
seen as fundamental. Refraining from assuming space-time as given a priori has
a number of consequences. First, the usual definitions of random- ness depend
on a causal structure and turn meaningless. So motivated, we propose an
intrinsic, physically motivated measure for the randomness of a string of bits:
its length minus its normalized work value, a quantity we closely relate to its
Kolmogorov complexity (the length of the shortest program making a universal
Turing machine output this string). We test this alternative concept of
randomness for the example of non-local correlations, and we end up with a
reasoning that leads to similar conclusions as, but is more direct than, in the
probabilistic view since only the outcomes of measurements that can actually
all be carried out together are put into relation to each other. In the same
context-free spirit, we connect the logical reversibility of an evolution to
the second law of thermodynamics and the arrow of time. Refining this, we end
up with a speculation on the emergence of a space-time structure on bit strings
in terms of data-compressibility relations. Finally, we show that logical
consistency, by which we replace the abandoned causality, it strictly weaker a
constraint than the latter in the multi-party case.

&quot;exceptional point&quot; occurs, around which many fascinating phenomena have

to appear when encircling an exceptional point sufficiently slowly, like a

this issue could already successfully explore the topological structure of
exceptional points, but a full dynamical encircling and the breakdown of
adiabaticity inevitably associated with it remained out of reach of any
measurement so far. Here we demonstrate that a dynamical encircling of an
exceptional point can be mapped onto the problem of scattering through a

results from a waveguide structure that steers incoming waves around an

with the input single photon state and the EPR state prepared independently. By
buffering photons in 10 km coiled optical fiber, we perform Bell state
measurement after entanglement distribution. With active feed-forward
operation, the average quantum state fidelity and quantum process fidelity are
measured to be 0.85 and 0.77, exceeding classical limits of 0.67 and 0.5,
respectively. The statistical hypothesis test shows that the probability of a
classical process to predict an average state fidelity no less than the one
observed in our experiment is less than 2.4E-14, confirming the quantum nature
of our quantum teleportation experiment. Our experiment marks a critical step
towards the realization of quantum internet in the future.

Bose-Hubbard model (BHM). Inspired by the success of BHM simulators with atoms
in optical lattices, proposals for implementing the BHM with photons in coupled
nonlinear cavities have emerged. Two coupled semiconductor microcavities
constitute a model system where the hopping, interaction, and decay of exciton
polaritons --- mixed light-matter quasiparticles --- can be engineered in
combination with site-selective coherent driving to implement the
driven-dissipative two-site optical BHM. Here we explore the interplay of
interference and nonlinearity in this system, in a regime where three distinct
density profiles can be observed under identical driving conditions. We
demonstrate how the phase acquired by polaritons hopping between cavities can
be controlled through effective polariton-polariton interactions. Our results
open new perspectives for synthesizing density-dependent gauge fields for
polaritons in two-dimensional multicavity systems.

even if the sender is untrusted. Such characteristics of quantum systems not
only provide direct applications to quantum information science, but are also
conceptually important for distinguishing between quantum and classical
resources. While concrete illustrations of steering have been shown in several
experiments, how steering effects vary with the system dimensionality (d) has
never been experimentally investigated. Here, we introduce a simple method to
experimentally certify two different kinds of quantum steering:
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering and single-system (SS) steering, for
dimensionality up to d=16. The former reveals the steerability among bipartite
systems, whereas the latter manifests itself in single quantum objects. We use
multidimensional steering witnesses to verify EPR steering of
polarization-entangled pairs and SS steering of single photons. The ratios
between the measured witnesses and the maximum values achieved by classical
mimicries are observed to increase with d for both EPR and SS steering. The
designed scenario offers a new method to study further the genuine multipartite
steering of large dimensionality and potential uses in quantum information

protect a room-temperature hybrid spin register against environmental
decoherence by performing repeated quantum error correction whilst maintaining
sensitivity to signal fields. We use a long-lived nuclear spin to correct

magnetic field sensing beyond the timescales set by natural decoherence. The

acknowledged. In fact, although it is usually said that quantum mechanics is
invariant under the Galilean group, the invariance is usually not discussed in
the case of the interpretation of the theory. This situation is particularly
pressing for realist positions, which want to know how reality would be if
quantum mechanics were true. From a realist perspective, it seems reasonable to
require that an interpretation of quantum mechanics, to be admissible,

system depends on both the initial state and the channel responsible for the
evolution. An extreme case is that of entanglement braking channels, which are
channels that acting on only one of the subsystems drives them to full
disentanglement regardless of the initial state. In general, one can find
certain combinations of initial states and channels acting on one or both
subsystems that can result in entanglement sudden death or not. Neither the
channel nor the initial state, but their combination, is responsible for this
effect, but their combination. In this work we show that, in all cases, when
entanglement sudden death occurs, the evolution can be mapped to that of an
effective entanglement breaking channel on a modified initial state. Our
results allow to anticipate which states will suffer entanglement sudden death
or not for a given evolution. An experiment with polarization entangled photons
demonstrates the utility of this result in a variety of cases.

develop systematic expansions based on the Ryu-Takayanagi prescription that
enable us to derive analytic expressions for entanglement entropy and mutual

specific regions of the bulk geometry that contribute most significantly to the
entanglement entropy of the boundary theory at different limits. We define a
scale, dubbed as the effective temperature, which determines the behavior of
entanglement in different regimes. At high effective temperature, entanglement
entropy is dominated by the thermodynamic entropy, however, mutual information
subtracts out this contribution and measures the actual quantum entanglement.
Finally, we study the entanglement/disentanglement transition of mutual

by Howard Wiseman and the author, I argue that the conflict between quantum
theory and relativity brought up by Bell's work can be softened by a revision
of our classical notions of causation. I review some recent proposals for a
quantum theory of causation that make great strides towards that end, but
highlight a property that is shared by all those theories that would not have
satisfied Bell's realist inclinations. They require (implicitly or explicitly)
agent-centric notions such as &quot;controllables&quot; and &quot;uncontrollables&quot;, or
&quot;observed&quot; and &quot;unobserved&quot;. Thus they relieve the tensions around Bell's
theorem by highlighting an issue more often associated with another deep
conceptual issue in quantum theory: the measurement problem. Rather than
rejecting those terms, however, I argue that we should understand why they seem
to be, at least at face-value, needed in order to reach compatibility between
quantum theory and relativity. This seems to suggest that causation, and thus
causal structure, are emergent phenomena, and lends support to the idea that a
resolution of the conflict between quantum theory and relativity necessitates a

(NV$^-$) centres being discussed as a potential laser medium since the 1980's,
there have been no definitive observations of stimulated emission from
ensembles of NV$^-$ to date. Reasons for this lack of demonstration include the
short excited state lifetime and the occurrence of photo-ionisation to the
neutral charge state by light around the zero-phonon line. Here we show both
theoretical and experimental evidence for stimulated emission from NV$^-$
states using light in the phonon-sidebands. Our system uses a continuous wave
pump laser at 532 nm and a pulsed stimulating laser that is swept across the
phononic sidebands of the NV$^-$. Optimal stimulated emission is demonstrated
in the vicinity of the three-phonon line at 700 nm. Furthermore, we show the
transition from stimulated emission to photoionisation as the stimulating laser
wavelength is reduced from 700nm to 620 nm. While lasing at the zero-phonon
line is suppressed by ionisation, our results open the possibility of diamond
lasers based on NV centres, tuneable over the phonon-sideband. This broadens
the applications of NV magnetometers from single centre nanoscale sensors to a
new generation of ultra-precise ensemble laser sensors, which exploit the

interferometry with massive objects. Here we explore how to minimize this
perturbation by reducing the thickness of the diffraction mask to its ultimate

diffraction masks in single-layer and bilayer graphene as well as in 1 nm thin

moderate size, e.g. biological samples. We analyze in detail the behaviour of
the quantum Fisher information (QFI), and determine the values of nonlinearity
maximizing the QFI as a function of the interaction time and of the parameters
of the input signal. We also discuss the precision achievable by photon
counting and quadrature measurement and present additional results for
truncated, few-photon, probe signals. Finally, we discuss the origin of the
precision enhancement, showing that it cannot be linked quantitatively to the
non-Gaussianity of the interacting probe signal.

gate model quantum computer and has shallow depth. It takes as input a
combinatorial optimization problem and outputs a string that satisfies a high
fraction of the maximum number of clauses that can be satisfied. For certain
problems the lowest depth version of the QAOA has provable performance
guarantees although there exist classical algorithms that have better
guarantees. Here we argue that beyond its possible computational value the QAOA
can exhibit a form of Quantum Supremacy in that, based on reasonable complexity
theoretic assumptions, the output distribution of even the lowest depth version
cannot be efficiently simulated on any classical device. We contrast this with
the case of sampling from the output of a quantum computer running the Quantum
Adiabatic Algorithm (QADI) with the restriction that the Hamiltonian that
governs the evolution is gapped and stoquastic. Here we show that there is an
oracle that would allow sampling from the QADI but even with this oracle, if
one could efficiently classically sample from the output of the QAOA, the
Polynomial Hierarchy would collapse. This suggests that the QAOA is an
excellent candidate to run on near term quantum computers not only because it
may be of use for optimization but also because of its potential as a route to
establishing quantum supremacy.

We analyze aspects of quantum reference frames associated with non-compact

begin by demonstrating how the usually employed group average, used to dispense
of the notion of an external reference frame, leads to unphysical states when
applied to reference frames associated with non-compact groups. However, we
show that this average does lead naturally to a reduced state on the relative

unitary operators acting over a finite Hilbert space, and a final measurement
step consisting on a set of projectors. In this work, we prove that the
application of these unitary operators before the measurement step is
equivalent to decomposing a unit vector into a sum of vectors and then
inverting some of their relative phases. We also prove that the vectors of that

we take the same measurement step on the Quantum Query Model and on the Block

unique (frustration free) ground state with an energy gap that is polynomially
small in the system's size ($2n$). The half-chain entanglement entropy of the

the magnetization is along the $z-$direction i.e., $\langle
s^{x}\rangle=\langle s^{y}\rangle=0$ (everywhere on the chain). We then
analytically calculate $\langle s^{z}\rangle$ and the two-point correlation

entropies for: 1. Any partition of the chain into two pieces (not necessarily

for solving practical optimization problems is their inability to encode even
moderately sized problems---the main reason for this being the rigid layout of
their quantum bits as well as their sparse connectivity. In particular, the
implementation of constraints has become a major bottleneck in the embedding of
practical problems, because the latter is typically achieved by adding harmful
penalty terms to the problem Hamiltonian --- a technique that often requires an
`all-to-all' connectivity between the qubits. Recently, a novel technique
designed to obviate the need for penalty terms was suggested; it is based on
the construction of driver Hamiltonians that commute with the constraints of
the problem, rendering the latter constants of motion. In this work we propose
general guidelines for the construction of such driver Hamiltonians given an
arbitrary set of constraints. We illustrate the broad applicability of our
method by analyzing several diverse examples, namely, graph isomorphism,
not-all-equal 3SAT, and the so-called Lechner, Hauke and Zoller constraints. We

  notions</title><description>  Quantum coherence is a critical resource for many operational tasks.
Understanding how to quantify and manipulate it also promises to have
applications for a diverse set of problems in theoretical physics. For certain
applications, however, one requires coherence between the eigenspaces of
specific physical observables, such as energy, angular momentum, or photon
number, and it makes a difference which eigenspaces appear in the
superposition. For others, there is a preferred set of subspaces relative to
which coherence is deemed a resource, but it is irrelevant which of the
subspaces appear in the superposition. We term these two types of coherence
unspeakable and speakable respectively. We argue that a useful approach to
quantifying and characterizing unspeakable coherence is provided by the
resource theory of asymmetry when the symmetry group is a group of
translations, and we translate a number of prior results on asymmetry into the
language of coherence. We also highlight some of the applications of this
approach, for instance, in the context of quantum metrology, quantum speed
limits, quantum thermodynamics, and NMR. The question of how best to treat
speakable coherence as a resource is also considered. We review a popular
approach in terms of operations that preserve the set of incoherent states,
propose an alternative approach in terms of operations that are covariant under
dephasing, and we outline the challenge of providing a physical justification

exponential in the size of the problem, $C(N)=\mathcal{O}(e^{C_1N}),~C_1\geq0$,
and succeeds on randomly chosen memory sets with a probability of
$(1-e^{-C_2N}),~C_2\geq0$ with $C_1+C_2=(.5-f)^2/(1-f)$, where,
$f=R(N)/N,~0\leq f\leq .5$ is the radius of attraction in terms of Hamming

However, realisation of a digital quantum computer is still a challenging

studied in the context of two types of operator algebras. The first setting is
mainly algebraic in that it involves unital C$^*$-algebras $A$ that possess a
faithful trace functional $\tau$. In this context, the role of quantum states
(that is, density operators) in the classical quantum-mechanical framework is
assumed by positive elements $\rho\in A$ for which $\tau(\rho)=1$. The second
of our two settings is more operator theoretic: by fixing a faithful normal
semifinite trace $\tau$ on a semifinite von Neumann algebra $M$, we define and
consider the fidelity of pairs of positive operators in $M$ of unit trace. The
main results of this paper address monotonicity and preservation of fidelity
under the action of certain trace-preserving positive linear maps of $A$ or of
the predual $M_*$. Our results also yield a new proof of a theorem of Moln\'ar
on the structure of quantum channels on the trace-class operators that preserve
fidelity.

spin systems with uniform ferromagnetic interactions. Starting from the
transverse-field Ising model coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators with
Ohmic spectral density, we generalize its classical representation to classical
spin systems with $O(n)$ symmetry and then take the large-$n$ limit to reduce
the system to the spherical model. The exact solution to the resulting
spherical model with long-range interactions along the imaginary-time axis
shows a phase transition with static critical exponents coinciding with those
of the conventional short-range spherical model in $d+2$ dimensions, where $d$
is the spatial dimensionality of the original quantum system. This implies the
dynamical exponent to be $z=2$. These conclusions are consistent with the
results of Monte Carlo simulations and renormalization group calculations for
dissipative transverse-field Ising and $O(n)$ models in one and two dimensions.
The present approach therefore serves as a useful tool to analytically
investigate the properties of quantum phase transitions of the dissipative
transverse-field Ising and related models. Our method may also offer a platform
to study more complex phase transitions in dissipative finite-dimensional
quantum spin systems, which recently receive renewed interest under the context
of quantum annealing in a noisy environment.

blackbody energy spectrum, provided one of the central historical motivations
for development of quantum mechanics. Nevertheless, our understanding of heat
and work for coupled quantum systems remains incomplete. A version of the EPR
paradox prevents simultaneously doing work on a quantum system and knowing how
much work has been done. A system can do work on its environment only if the
two have a nonzero interaction energy. During interaction, two become
entangled, leading to a superposition of different possible values for the
work. According to quantum mechanics, measuring the work projects into a state
with exactly zero interaction energy. Therefore the system-environment
interaction is always either zero or unknown.
  This paper proposes observational definitions of heat and work based on the
interaction of a quantum system and measurement apparatus. These definitions
are consistent with the usual laws of thermodynamics at all temperatures. The
statistics of the central system are known to go over to a quantum Boltzmann
distribution in the limit of very slow measurement and small interaction. At
finite measurement rates, interaction with the environment makes the system
unable to reach absolute zero. Repeatedly measured quantum systems are thus
predicted to exhibit a minimum achievable temperature. The phenomenon of
minimum temperature offers a novel explanation of recent experiments aimed at
testing fluctuation theorems in the quantum realm.

opens perspectives for novel quantum simulators of finite-range interacting
systems, even though the light-induced interaction is global (i.e. infinitely
long range). This is achieved by spatial structuring of the global light-matter
coupling at a microscopic scale. Such simulators can directly benefit from the
collective enhancement of the global light-matter interaction and constitute an
alternative to standard approaches using Rydberg atoms or polar molecules. The
system in the steady state of light induces effective many-body interactions
that change the landscape of the phase diagram of the typical Bose-Hubbard
model. Therefore, the system can support non-trivial superfluid states, bosonic
dimer, trimers, etc. states and supersolid phases depending on the choice of
the wavelength and pattern of the light with respect to the classical optical
lattice potential. We find that by carefully choosing the system parameters one

and thermodynamics play competing roles. In particular, we study the creation
of quantum coherence using unitary operations with limited thermodynamic
resources. We first find the maximal coherence that can be created under
unitary operations starting from a thermal state and find explicitly the
unitary transformation that creates the maximal coherence. Since coherence is
created by unitary operations starting from a thermal state, it requires some
amount of energy. This motivates us to explore the trade-off between the amount
of coherence that can be created and the energy cost of the unitary process. We
find the maximal achievable coherence under the constraint on the available
energy. Additionally, we compare the maximal coherence and the maximal total
correlation that can be created under unitary transformations with the same
available energy at our disposal. We find that when maximal coherence is
created with limited energy, the total correlation created in the process is
upper bounded by the maximal coherence and vice versa. For two qubit systems we
show that there does not exist any unitary transformation that creates maximal
coherence and maximal total correlation simultaneously with a limited energy
cost.

limit for all matter, i.e, the kinetic energy becomes local. Exchange also
becomes local in this limit. Numerical data on the correlation energy of atoms
supports the conjecture that this is also true for correlation, but much less
relevant to atoms. We illustrate how expansions around large particle number
are equivalent to local density approximations and their strong relevance to
density functional approximations. Analyzing highly accurate atomic correlation
energies, we show that the correlation energy tends to $-A_c Z ln Z + B_c Z$ as
$Z$ tends to infinity, where $Z$ is the atomic number, $A_c$ is known, and we
estimate $B_c$ to be about 37 millihartrees. The local density approximation
yields $A_c$ exactly, but a very incorrect value for $B_c$, showing that the
local approximation is less relevant for correlation alone. This limit is a
benchmark for the non-empirical construction of density functional
approximations. We conjecture that, beyond atoms, the leading correction to the

$O(10^{19})$ to $O(10^{15})$ for a 14-qubit state, by dropping all the zero
elements, and its computational efficiency is further sped up by fully
exploiting the parallelism of the LRE algorithm with parallel Graphic

microscopy or inertial sensing \cite{RMPforce2003, Rugar2004, YazdiIEEE}. These
sensors often rely on the measurement of the displacement amplitude of
mechanical oscillators under applied force. Examples for such mechanical
oscillators include micro-fabricated cantilevers \cite{YazdiIEEE}, carbon
nanotubes \cite{NanotubeForce} as well as single trapped ions \cite{Bollinger,
Udem} . The best sensitivity is typically achieved when the force is
alternating at the mechanical resonance frequency of the oscillator thus
increasing its response by the mechanical quality factor. The measurement of
low-frequency forces, that are below resonance, is a more difficult task as the
resulting oscillation amplitudes are significantly lower. Here we use a single
trapped $^{88}Sr^{+}$ ion as a force sensor. The ion is trapped in a linear
harmonic trap, and is electrically driven at a frequency much lower than the
trap resonance frequency. To be able to measure the small amplitude of motion
we combine two powerful techniques. The force magnitude is determined by the
measured periodic Doppler shift of an atomic optical clock transition and the
Quantum Lock-in technique is used to coherently accumulate the phases acquired
during different force half-cycles. We demonstrate force detection both when
the oscillating force is phase-synchronized with the quantum lock-in sequence
and when it is asynchronous and report frequency force detection sensitivity as
low as $5.3\times10^{-19}\frac{\mathrm{N}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ .

classically or quantally. This is not so surprising, as classical and quantum
physics are descriptive frameworks built on different assumptions that capture,
emphasize, and express different properties and mechanisms. What is surprising
is that, as we demonstrate, simplicity is ambiguous: the relative simplicity
between two systems can change sign when moving between classical and quantum
descriptions. Thus, notions of absolute physical simplicity---minimal structure
or memory---at best form a partial, not a total, order. This suggests that
appeals to principles of physical simplicity, via Ockham's Razor or to the
&quot;elegance&quot; of competing theories, may be fundamentally subjective, perhaps even
beyond the purview of physics itself. It also raises challenging questions in
model selection between classical and quantum descriptions. Fortunately,
experiments are now beginning to probe measures of simplicity, creating the
potential to directly test for ambiguity.

low-energy interactions we switch on the interaction of slow neutrons with a

gravitational, chameleon and torsion fields the Dirac Hamilton operator for
fermions (neutrons), moving in spacetimes created by rotating coordinate
systems, contains the anti-Hermitian operators of torsion-fermion (neutron)
interactions, caused by torsion scalar and tensor degrees of freedom. Such
anti-Hermitian operators violate CP and T invariance. One may assume that in
the rotating Universe and galaxies the obtained anti-Hermitian torsion-fermion
interactions might be an origin of i) violation of CP and T invariance in the

transition. Recently, the reciprocal transmission, unidirectional
reflectionless and invisibility are intensively studied. Here, we show the
reciprocal reflection/transmission in PT -symmetric system is closely related

to reciprocal reflection (transmission). The results are further elucidated by
studying the scattering of rhombic ring form coupled resonators with enclosed

uniformly-coupled spins subject to a transverse magnetic field. The discrete
many-body problem is mapped onto dynamics of a single one-dimensional particle

illustrates explicitly a graceful warping from an entangled unimodal to

  Apparatus</title><description>  Measurement in quantum mechanics is generally described as an irreversible
process that perturbs the wavefunction describing a quantum system. In this
work we establish a formal connection between the measurement description
within the Copenhagen interpretation (i.e., through the collapse of the
wavefunction) compared versus a picture in which the system and the measurement
apparatus are considered as a whole. We first consider a projective
measurement. In this limiting case, the natural requirements of consistency and
equivalence between the two pictures lead to the rigorous definition of
consistent measuring apparatus: the orthonormal wavefunctions from the Schmidt
decomposition of the system plus apparatus must have non-overlapping supports.
This result arises from the comparison of the two pictures (otherwise hidden),
and while it seems to be an obvious conclusion in the limit of projective
measurements, it has some nontrivial implications as one extends its validity
to the domain of weak measurements. In this respect, we argue on the existence
of two alternative approaches to mathematically constructing a weak measurement
protocol. While the two approaches are equivalent from the system's
perspective, they do strongly differ from the apparatus point of view, and
hence can be only distinguished one from each other in the picture where system
and apparatus are considered as a whole. We show that only one of the two
mathematical formulations of the weak measurement fulfills the consistent
apparatus condition, while the combination of the two gives rise to a
generalized weak measurements framework.

the complexity of simulating them on a classical computer. A recent advance of
Landau et al. gave a polynomial time algorithm to actually compute a succinct
classical description for unique ground states of gapped 1D quantum systems.
Despite this progress many questions remained unresolved, including whether
there exist rigorous efficient algorithms when the ground space is degenerate
(and poly($n$) dimensional), or for the poly($n$) lowest energy states for 1D
systems, or even whether such states admit succinct classical descriptions or
area laws.
  In this paper we give a new algorithm for finding low energy states for 1D
systems, based on a rigorously justified RG type transformation. In the process
we resolve some of the aforementioned open questions, including giving a
polynomial time algorithm for poly($n$) degenerate ground spaces and an
$n^{O(\log n)}$ algorithm for the poly($n$) lowest energy states for 1D systems
(under a mild density condition). We note that for these classes of systems the
existence of a succinct classical description and area laws were not rigorously
proved before this work. The algorithms are natural and efficient, and for the
case of finding unique ground states for frustration-free Hamiltonians the
running time is $\tilde{O}(nM(n))$, where $M(n)$ is the time required to
multiply two $n\times n$ matrices.

It is primarily because of its ability to manipulate population among the

correlations, exhibit characteristic properties of quantum mechanics
distinguishing from classical theories. When entanglement is accompanied by
classical communication, it enhances the power of quantum operations jointly
performed by two spatially separated parties. Such a power has been analyzed by
the gap between the performances of joint quantum operations implementable by
local operations at each party connected by classical communication with and
without the assistance of entanglement. In this work, we present a new
formulation for joint quantum operations connected by classical communication
beyond special relativistic causal order but without entanglement and still
within quantum mechanics. Using the formulation, we show that entanglement
assisting classical communication necessary for implementing a class of joint
quantum operations called separable maps can be interpreted to simulate
&quot;classical communication&quot; not respecting causal order. Our results reveal a new
counter-intuitive aspect of entanglement related to spacetime.

  simulations</title><description>  As a phase space language for quantum mechanics, the Wigner function approach
bears a close analogy to classical mechanics and has been drawing growing
attention, especially in simulating quantum many-body systems. However,
deterministic numerical solutions have been almost exclusively confined to
one-dimensional one-body systems and few results are reported even for
one-dimensional two-body problems. This paper serves as the first attempt to
solve the time-dependent many-body Wigner equation through a grid-based
advective-spectral-mixed method. The main feature of the method is to resolve
the linear advection in $(\bm{x},t)$-space by an explicit three-step
characteristic scheme coupled with the piecewise cubic spline interpolation,
while the Chebyshev spectral element method in $\bm k$-space is adopted for
accurate calculation of the nonlocal pseudo-differential term. Not only the
time step of the resulting method is not restricted by the usual CFL condition
and thus a large time step is allowed, but also the mass conservation can be
maintained. In particular, for the system consisting of identical particles,
the advective-spectral-mixed method can also rigorously preserve physical
symmetry relations. The performance is validated through several typical
numerical experiments, like the Gaussian barrier scattering, electron-electron
interaction and a Helium-like system, where the third-order accuracy against
both grid spacing and time stepping is observed.

vertices of $G$ with $0, 1, \cdots, e$ such that, if we specify to each edge
the difference value between its two ends, then any of $1, 2, \cdots, e$
appears exactly once as an edge label. For a given graph, there is still few
efficient classical algorithms that determines either it is graceful or not,
even for trees - as a well-known class of graphs. In this paper, we introduce
an adiabatic quantum algorithm, which for a graceful graph $G$ finds a graceful
labelling. Also, this algorithm can determine if $G$ is not graceful. Numerical
simulations of the algorithm reveal that its time complexity has a polynomial

This reversal procedure through CNOT and Hadamard gates, could also protect the

capabilities of a quantum channel. The main conceptual development builds
firmly on the notion of a private state [Horodecki et al., PRL 94, 160502
(2005)], which is a powerful, uniquely quantum method for simplifying the
tripartite picture of privacy involving local operations and public classical
communication to a bipartite picture of quantum privacy involving local
operations and classical communication. This approach has previously led to
some of the strongest upper bounds on secret key rates, including the squashed
entanglement and the relative entropy of entanglement. Here we use this
approach along with a &quot;privacy test&quot; to establish a general meta-converse bound
for private communication, which has a number of applications. The
meta-converse allows for proving that any quantum channel's relative entropy of
entanglement is a strong converse rate for private communication. For covariant
channels, the meta-converse also leads to second-order expansions of relative
entropy of entanglement bounds for private communication rates. For such
channels, the bounds also apply to the private communication setting in which
the sender and receiver are assisted by unlimited public classical
communication, and as such, they are relevant for establishing various converse
bounds for quantum key distribution protocols conducted over these channels. We
find precise characterizations for several channels of interest and apply the
methods to establish several converse bounds on the private transmission
capabilities of all phase-insensitive bosonic channels.

moreover, invariant under SU(2) transformations. We demonstrate that these

not sufficient: the new formalisms also need to have equivalent deductive
power. This requirement is captured by the property of completeness, which
means that any equality that can be derived using some standard formalism can
also be derived graphically.
  In this thesis, I consider the ZX-calculus, a graphical language for pure
state qubit quantum mechanics. I show that it is complete for pure state
stabilizer quantum mechanics, so any problem within this fragment of quantum
theory can be fully analysed using graphical methods. This includes questions
of central importance in areas such as error-correcting codes or
measurement-based quantum computation. Furthermore, I show that the ZX-calculus
is complete for the single-qubit Clifford+T group, which is approximately
universal: any single-qubit unitary can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy
using only Clifford gates and the T-gate. [...] Lastly, I extend the use of
rigorous graphical languages outside quantum theory to Spekkens' toy theory, a
local hidden variable model that nevertheless exhibits some features commonly
associated with quantum mechanics. [...] I develop a graphical calculus similar
to the ZX-calculus that fully describes Spekkens' toy theory, and show that it
is complete. Hence, stabilizer quantum mechanics and Spekkens' toy theory can
be fully analysed and compared using graphical formalisms.
  Intuitive graphical languages can replace conventional formalisms for the
analysis of many questions in quantum computation and foundations without loss

wavefunctions were obtained and the dynamics of the initial atomic and
molecular waves in a spherical one-dimensional trap were studied by solving the
time-dependent atom-molecular coupled equations. During evolution two types of
induced or stimulated decays of the feshbach molecules were switched on. These
two types of stimulated decays of the feshbach molecules to the two-atom
continuum and to the bound level of the lowest hyperfinee state of the molecule
were induced by laser or Radio Frequency fields. Hence the strength of these
two induced decays can be controlled by varying the laser or RF field
parameters e.g. intensity, detuning etc. It is found that depending on the
relative strength of these two types of stimulated or induced decays initial
atomic and molecular waves assume solitonic nature as bright solitons during
evolution and the stability of these solitonic waves can be achieved by
controlling the relative strength of induced decays in two different channels.
It is shown that these two induced decays lead to the formation of stable
atomic and molecular solitons by suppressing the initial oscillations and
instability in the atom-molecular coupled system of 85Rb atoms.

to the description of quantum errors and disturbances. Their criticisms are
justified to the extent that the physical meaning of the operator definitions
has not hitherto been adequately explained. We rectify that omission. We then
examine BLW's criticisms in the light of our analysis. We argue that, although
the approach BLW favour (based on the Wasserstein 2-deviation) has its uses,
there are important physical situations where an operator approach is
preferable. We also discuss the reason why the error-disturbance relation is
still giving rise to controversies almost a century after Heisenberg first
stated his microscope argument. We argue that the source of the difficulties is
the problem of interpretation, which is not so wholly disconnected from
experimental practicalities as is sometimes supposed.

  Energy Transfer, Upconversion and Pooling</title><description>  Resonant energy transfer, energy transfer upconversion, and energy pooling
are considered within optical cavities to elucidate the relationship between
exciton dynamics and donor/acceptor separation distance. This is accomplished
using perturbation theory to derive analytic expressions for the electric
dipole coupling tensors of perfect planar and rectangular channel
reflectors---directly related to a number of important energy transfer
processes. In the near field, the separation dependence along the cavity axis
is not influenced by the cavity and is essentially the same as for
three-dimensional, free space. This is in sharp contrast to the reduced
sensitivity to separation found in idealized low-dimensional settings. The
cavity dynamics only correspond to their reduced dimensional counterparts in
the far field where such excitonic processes are not typically of interest.
There is an intermediate regime, though, where sufficiently small cavities
cause a substantial decrease in separation sensitivity that results in one
component of the dipole-dipole coupling tensor being much larger than those of
free space.

temporal steering allows two parties to verify if they have been interacting

nonseparable processes, which are incompatible with any definite causal order.
This was first suggested on a rather abstract level by the formalism of process
matrices, which only assumes that quantum theory holds locally in some
observers' laboratories, but does not impose a global causal structure; it was
then shown, on a more practical level, that the quantum switch---a new resource
for quantum computation that goes beyond causally ordered circuits---provided
precisely a physical example of a causally nonseparable process. To demonstrate
that a given process is causally nonseparable, we introduced in [Ara\'ujo et

nonseparability. Here we present a shorter introduction to this concept, and
concentrate on some explicit examples to show how to construct and use such

intractable for a classical computer, yet requiring minimal non-classical
resources as compared to full-scale quantum computers. Photonic implementations
to date employed sources based on inefficient processes that only simulate
heralded single-photon statistics when strongly reducing emission
probabilities. BosonSampling with only single-photon input has thus never been
realised. Here, we report on a BosonSampling device operated with a bright
solid-state source of highly-pure single-photon Fock states: the emission from
an efficient and deterministic quantum dot-micropillar system is demultiplexed
into three partially-indistinguishable single-photons, with purity
$1{-}g^{(2)}(0)$ of $0.990\pm0.001$, interfering in a $6{\times}6$ linear
optics network. Our demultiplexed source is orders-of-magnitude brighter than
current heralded multi-photon sources based on spontaneous parametric
down-conversion, allowing us to complete the BosonSampling experiment 100 times
faster than previous equivalent implementations. This intrinsic source

analyzed with a general mixing of scalar and vector couplings via continuous

the scalar coupling, a Sturm-Liouville approaching for the double-step
potential shows that the transmission coefficient exhibits oscillations and
that a finite set of intrinsically relativistic bound-state solutions might
appear as poles of the transmission amplitude in a strong coupling regime. An
isolated bound-state solution resulting from coupled first-order equations
might also come into sight. It is also shown that all those possible bound
solutions disappear asymptotically as one approaches the conditions for the

PRL 112, 133601 (2014)], we considered the two-photon up-conversion process in
a single molecule within one-dimensional input-output theory, and revealed that
controlling the antenna-molecule coupling enables the efficient up-conversion
with radiative loss in the antenna suppressed. In this work, aiming to propose
a way to enhance the total probability of antenna-photon scattering, we extend
the model to the case of multiple molecules. In general, the presence of more
than one molecule decreases the up-conversion probability because they equally
share the energy of the two photons. However, it is shown that we can overcome
the difficulty by controlling the inter-molecule coupling. Our result implies
that, without increasing the incident photon number (light power), we can
enlarge the net probability of the two-photon up-conversion.

It is believed that a strong magnetic field is needed for the spin echo to
provide long memory and high resolution since a degenerate spin cannot be

never subject to dynamic control, it is still subject to geometric control.
Here we show the spin echo of a degenerate spin subsystem, which is
geometrically controlled via a mediating state split by the crystal field, in a
nitrogen vacancy center in diamond. The demonstration reveals that the
degenerate spin is protected by inherent symmetry breaking called zero-field
splitting. The geometric spin echo under zero field provides an ideal way to
maintain the coherence without any dynamics, thus opening the way to
pseudo-static quantum random access memory and non-invasive biosensors.

anti-symmetric initial condition, with respect to the symmetric sites, and
using a probe that acts like a local noise. Depending on the position of the
probe the currents exhibit unique signatures such as a quasi-stationary plateau
indicating the presence of meta-stability and multi-exponential decays in case
of multiple symmetries. The signatures are sensitive to the probe and vanish
completely when the timescale of the coherent system dynamics is much longer
than the timescale of the probe. These results are demonstrated using a
$4$-site model and an archetypal example of the para-benzene ring and are shown
to be robust under a weak disorder.

operator and its numerical applications in quantum dynamics is proposed and
analyzed. We start from the discussion on two typical truncations of the
nonlocal term, i.e., the $k$-truncated and $y$-truncated models. After
introducing an auxiliary function $\gamma(\bm{x})$, the (truncated) Wigner
equation is reformulated into the integral formulation as well as its adjoint
correspondence, both of which can be regarded as the renewal-type equations and
have transparent stochastic interpretation. We prove that the moment of a
branching process happens to be the solution for the adjoint equation, which
connects rigorously the Wigner quantum dynamics to the stochastic branching
process, and thus a sound mathematical framework for the Wigner Monte Carlo
methods is established. Within the framework, the branching process for the
$y$-truncated model recovers the popular signed particle Monte Carlo method
which needs a discretization of the momentum space beforehand, whereas the
$k$-truncated branching method allows a continuous momentum sampling. More
interestingly, with the help of the rigorous connection, we find that a
constant auxiliary function $\gamma(\bm{x})\equiv\gamma_0$ performs better from
the point of view of both theoretical and numerical aspects. In theory, we
obtain a simple but analytical calculation formula for the growth rate of
particle number, i.e., $\me^{2\gamma_0 t}$ with $t$ being the time. In
numerics, the constant auxiliary function may facilitate the random sampling
from the exponential distribution and improve the accuracy. Typical numerical
experiments on the Gaussian barrier scattering validate our theoretical
findings, as well as demonstrate the accuracy, the efficiency and thus the
computability of the Wigner branching process.

depends upon the number of rounds of quantum communication involved in a scheme

important to understand what does it mean and how can we explain the existence
of strong correlations between outcomes of distant measurements, predicted by
quantum mechanics. Do we have to announce that: Einstein was wrong, Nature is

emerge, somehow, from outside space-time? We reject such conclusions and we

careful commentators on Bohr to the effect that he, after all, did subscribe to
some version of quantum fundamentalism. Against this consensus, and by
re-examining the historical record, I will defend a variant of the traditional

classical) depends on the experimental context; and (2) in principle, any
physical system can be treated quantum-mechanically but not all systems can be
treated that way at the same time.

interaction between a purely magnetic object (neutron) and a purely electric

re-examine Bohr's interpretation of quantum mechanics, and argue that the

measurement problem. More generally, I attempt to clarify Bohr's view on the
classical/quantum divide, arguing that the relation between the two theories is
that of mutual dependence. An important element in this clarification consists
in distinguishing Bohr's idea of the wave function as symbolic from both a
purely epistemic and an ontological interpretation. Together with new evidence
concerning Bohr's conception of the wave function collapse, this sets his
interpretation apart from both standard versions of the Copenhagen
interpretation, and from some of the reconstructions of his view found in the

challenging endeavor. Many parameters need to be optimized to achieve
high-fidelity operations. This can be done efficiently for operations acting on
single qubits as errors can be fully characterized. For multi-qubit operations,
though, this is no longer the case as in the most general case analyzing the
effect of the operation on the system requires a full state tomography for
which resources scale exponentially with the system size. Furthermore, in
recent experiments additional electronic levels beyond the two-level system
encoding the qubit have been used to enhance the capabilities of quantum
information processors, which additionally increases the number of parameters
that need to be controlled. For the optimization of the experimental system for
a given task (e.g.~a quantum algorithm), one has to find a satisfactory error
model and also efficient observables to estimate the parameters of the model.
In this manuscript we demonstrate a method to optimize the encoding procedure
for a small quantum error correction code in the presence of unknown but
constant phase shifts. The method, which we implement here on a small-scale

integrable quantum lattice systems. The central concept are the so-called
quasilocal conserved quantities, which go beyond the standard perception of
locality. Two systematic procedures to rigorously construct families of
quasilocal conserved operators based on quantum transfer matrices are outlined,
specializing on anisotropic Heisenberg XXZ spin-1/2 chain. Quasilocal conserved
operators stem from two distinct classes of representations of the auxiliary
space algebra, comprised of unitary (compact) representations, which can be
naturally linked to the fusion algebra and quasiparticle content of the model,
and non-unitary (non-compact) representations giving rise to charges,
manifestly orthogonal to the unitary ones. Various condensed matter
applications in which quasilocal conservation laws play an essential role are
presented, with special emphasis on their implications for anomalous transport
properties (finite Drude weight) and relaxation to non-thermal steady states in
the quantum quench scenario.

  States</title><description>  Motivated by the current interest in dynamically preparing topological states
in ultracold atomic gases, we consider a two-dimensional system initialized in
a topologically trivial state before its Hamiltonian is ramped into a
Chern-insulator phase. Under coherent dynamics, the non-equilibrium Hall
response is found to approach a topologically quantized time averaged value in
the limit of slow parameter ramps, even though the Chern number of the state is
constrained to remain trivial. Quite remarkably, the destruction of quantum
coherence by dephasing stabilizes the Hall response towards its asymptotically
quantized mean value by damping its oscillations. We demonstrate how this
phenomenology generically arises from the interplay of Landau-Zener dynamics
and dephasing. In the limit of a fast ramp (quench), we show how the presence
of a cooling quantum bath enables a dynamical transition of the state's Chern
number from trivial to non-trivial, accompanied by the onset of a quantized
Hall response.

quantum metrology. While much progress has been made in single-photon source
technologies, preparing Fock states with large photon number remains
challenging. We present and analyze a bootstrapped approach for
non-deterministically preparing large photon-number Fock states by iteratively
fusing smaller Fock states on a beamsplitter. We show that by employing state
recycling we are able to exponentially improve the preparation rate over
conventional schemes, allowing the efficient preparation of large Fock states.

cavity, which is derived from the Maxwell boundary conditions at a mirror of
the cavity, a master equation of a non-Lindblad form is derived when the cavity
embeds matters, although we can transform it to the Lindblad form by performing
the rotating-wave approximation to the connecting Hamiltonian. We calculate
absorption spectra by these Lindblad and non-Lindblad master equations and also
by the Maxwell boundary conditions in the framework of the classical
electrodynamics, which we consider the most reliable approach. We found that,
compared to the Lindblad master equation, the absorption spectra by the
non-Lindblad one agree better with those by the Maxwell boundary conditions.
Although the discrepancy is highlighted only in the ultra-strong light-matter
interaction regime with a relatively large broadening, the master equation of
the non-Lindblad form is preferable rather than of the Lindblad one for
pursuing the consistency with the classical electrodynamics.

  of entangled photon sources</title><description>  Photon modes have an important role in characterizing the quantum sources of
light. Proper coupling of various photon modes obtained in spontaneous
parametric down conversion (SPDC) process in optical fibers is essential to
generate an effective source of entangled photons. The two main pre-detection
factors affecting the biphoton mode coupling in SPDC are the pump beam focusing
parameter and the crystal thickness. We present the numerical and experimental
results on the effect of pump focusing on conditional down-converted photon
modes for a Type-I BBO crystal. We experimentally verify that biphoton coupling
efficiency decreases asymptotically with pump beam focusing parameter. We
attribute this behaviour to (a) the asymmetry in the spatial distribution of
down-converted photons with the pump beam focusing parameter and (b) the
ellipticity of biphoton modes introduced due to the focusing of the pump beam.
We also show experimentally the ellipticity as well as quantify the asymmetry
with the pump focusing parameter. These results may be useful in selecting
optimum conditions in the down-conversion process for generating efficient
sources of entangled photons for quantum information applications.

by telegraph noise, i.e. random Markovian jumps of the (spinless) electron
energy on the dot between two levels. The temporal evolutions of the charge on
the dot and of the currents in the leads are studied using a recently developed
single-particle basis approach, which is particularly convenient for the
averaging over the histories of the noise. In the steady state limit we recover
the Landauer formula. At a very fast jump rate between the two levels, the
noise does not affect the transport. As the jump rate decreases, the effective
average transmission crosses over from the transmission through a single
(average) level to an incoherent sum of the transmissions through the two
levels. 13 pages, 6 figuresThe transient temporal evolution towards the steady
state is dominated by the displacement current at short times, and by the
Landauer current at long times. It contains oscillating terms, which decay to
zero faster than for the case without noise. When the average chemical
potential on the leads equals the dot's &quot;original&quot; energy, without the noise,
the oscillations disappear completely and the transient evolution becomes
independent of the noise.

two-photon coherence of almost atomic velocity groups in the Doppler-broadened

and study two of the most relevant effects of the vacuum field fluctuations:
the dissipation, and the decoherence of the particle's internal degrees of
freedom. We consider the particle to follow a classical, macroscopically-fixed
trajectory. To study the dissipative effects, we calculate the in-out effective
action by functionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic
degrees of freedom of both the plate and the particle. This in-out effective
action develops an imaginary part, hence a non-vanishing probability for the
decay (because of friction) of the initial vacuum state. We analyze how the
dissipation is affected by the relative velocity between the particle and the
plate and the properties of the microscopic degrees of freedom. In order to
study the effects of decoherence over the internal degrees of freedom of the
particle, we calculate the CTP or Schwinger-Keldysh influence action, by
functionally integrating over the vacuum field and the microscopic degrees of
freedom of the plate. We estimate the decoherence time as the time needed by
two different quantum configurations (of the internal degree of freedom of the
particle) to be possible to differentiate from one another. We analyze the way
in which the presence of the mirror affects the decoherence, and the possible
ways to maximize or reduce its effects.

The SiV offers an optically accessible {\Lambda}-type level structure with a

number of qubits of a polynomial size quantum proof and have a constant gap
between completeness and soundness. Despite an impressive body of work trying
to prove or disprove the quantum PCP conjecture, it still remains widely open.
The above-mentioned proof verification statement has also been shown equivalent
to the QMA-completeness of the Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative
gap. Nevertheless, unlike in the classical case, no equivalent formulation in
the language of multi-prover games is known.
  In this work, we propose a new type of quantum proof systems, the Pointer
QPCP, where a verifier first accesses a classical proof that he can use as a
pointer to which qubits from the quantum part of the proof to access. We define
the Pointer QPCP conjecture, that states that all problems in QMA admit quantum
verifiers that first access a logarithmic number of bits from the classical
part of a polynomial size proof, then act on a constant number of qubits from
the quantum part of the proof, and have a constant gap between completeness and
soundness. We define a new QMA-complete problem, the Set Local Hamiltonian
problem, and a new restricted class of quantum multi-prover games, called CRESP
games. We use them to provide two other equivalent statements to the Pointer
QPCP conjecture: the Set Local Hamiltonian problem with constant relative gap
is QMA-complete; and the approximation of the maximum acceptance probability of
CRESP games up to a constant additive factor is as hard as QMA. This is the
first equivalence between a quantum PCP statement and the inapproximability of
quantum multi-prover games.

  Lattices</title><description>  Photonic lattices provide an excellent platform for simulating conventional
topological systems, and they can also be explored for the study of novel
topological phases. However, a direct measurement of bulk topological
invariants remains a great challenge. Here we study topological features of
generalized commensurate Aubry-Andre-Harper (AAH) photonic lattices and
construct a topological phase diagram by calculating all bulk Chern numbers,
and then explore the bulk-edge correspondence by analyzing the topological edge
states and their winding numbers. In contrast to incommensurate AAH models, we
find that diagonal and off-diagonal commensurate AAH models are not
topologically equivalent. In particular, nontrivial topological phases with
large Chern numbers and topological phase transitions are possible. By
implementing Thouless pumping of light in photonic lattices, we propose a
simple scheme to measure the bulk Chern numbers.

Unruh-DeWitt model of a two-level atom interacting relativistically with a
quantum field and treat the atom as an open quantum system to derive the master
equation governing its evolution. By means of quantum state discrimination, we
detect the accelerated motion of the atom by examining its time evolving state.
It turns out that the optimal strategy for the detection of the Unruh effect,
to which the accelerated atom is sensitive, involves letting the

  cryptography</title><description>  We consider two-way continuous-variable quantum key distribution, studying
its security against general eavesdropping strategies. Assuming the asymptotic
limit of many signals exchanged, we prove that two-way Gaussian protocols are
immune to coherent attacks. More precisely we show the general superadditivity
of the two-way security thresholds, which are proven to be higher than the
corresponding one-way counterparts in all cases. We perform the security
analysis first reducing the general eavesdropping to a two-mode coherent
Gaussian attack, and then showing that the superadditivity is achieved by
exploiting the random on/off switching of the two-way quantum communication.
This allows the parties to choose the appropriate communication instances to
prepare the key, accordingly to the tomography of the quantum channel. The
random opening and closing of the circuit represents, in fact, an additional
degree of freedom allowing the parties to convert, a posteriori, the two-mode
correlations of the eavesdropping into noise. The eavesdropper is assumed to
have no access to the on/off switching and, indeed, cannot adapt her attack. We
explicitly prove that this mechanism enhances the security performance, no

the Kramers escape problem of a classical random dynamical field. This
dynamical field is simulated efficiently by Path Integral Quantum Monte Carlo

spins of the thermally-assisted quantum tunneling rate and the escape rate of
the QMC process are identical. We relate this effect to the existence of a
dominant instantonic tunneling path.cThe instanton trajectory is described by
nonlinear dynamical mean-field theory equations for a single site magnetization

with the number of spins N while a purely classical over-the-barrier activation

quantum-secure key rate has the form $R(\eta) = D\eta^s$ bits per mode, where
$\eta$ is the end-to-end channel's transmissivity, and the constants $D$ and
$s$ are functions of various device inefficiencies and the resource constraint,
such as the number of available photon sources at each repeater node. Even with
lossy devices, we show that it is possible to attain $s &lt; 1$, and in turn
outperform the maximum key rate attainable without quantum repeaters, $R_{\rm

are often characterized by the presence of peripheral ring-like structures,
where the excitation is initialized, and inner reaction centers (RC), where the
excitation is trapped. The peripheral rings display coherent features: their
eigenstates can be separated in the two classes of superradiant and subradiant
states. Both are important to optimize transfer efficiency. In the absence of
disorder, superradiant states have an enhanced coupling strength to the RC,
while the subradiant ones are basically decoupled from it. Static on-site
disorder induces a coupling between subradiant and superradiant states,
creating an indirect coupling to the RC. The problem of finding the optimal
transfer conditions, as a function of both the RC energy and the disorder
strength, is very complex even in the simplest network, namely a three-level
system. In this paper we analyze such trimeric structure choosing as initial
condition a subradiant state, rather than the more common choice of an
excitation localized on a site. We show that, while the optimal disorder is of
the order of the superradiant coupling, the optimal detuning between the
initial state and the RC energy strongly depends on system parameters: when the
superradiant coupling is much larger than the energy gap between the
superradiant and the subradiant levels, optimal transfer occurs if the RC
energy is at resonance with the subradiant initial state, whereas we find an
optimal RC energy at resonance with a virtual dressed state when the
superradiant coupling is smaller than or comparable with the gap. The presence
of dynamical noise, which induces dephasing and decoherence, affects the
resonance structure of energy transfer producing an additional 'incoherent'
resonance peak, which corresponds to the RC energy being equal to the energy of
the superradiant state.

the amount of chaos is the overall complexity of the wave function. Some simple

However, the correlation is not perfect, because the measures do not depend on

of quantum gravity, I suggest that the main one concerns defining
superpositions of causal structures. This leads me to a distinction between
time and space, to a further degree than that present in the canonical approach
to general relativity. With this distinction, one can make sense of
superpositions as interference between alternative paths in the relational
configuration space of the entire Universe. But the full use of relationalism
brings us to a timeless picture of Nature, as it does in the canonical approach
(which culminates in the Wheeler-DeWitt equation). After a discussion of
Parmenides and the Eleatics' rejection of time, I show that there is middle
ground between their view of absolute timelessness and a view of physics taking
place in timeless configuration space. In this middle ground, even though
change does not fundamentally exist, the illusion of change can be recovered in
a way not permitted by Parmenides. It is recovered through a particular density
distribution over configuration space which gives rise to 'records'.
Incidentally, this distribution seems to have the potential to dissolve further
aspects of the measurement problem that can still be argued to haunt the
application of decoherence to Many-Worlds quantum mechanics. I end with a
discussion indicating that the conflict between the conclusions of this paper
and our view of the continuity of the self may still intuitively bother us.
Nonetheless, those conclusions should be no more challenging to our intuition
than Derek Parfit's thought experiments on the subject.

  nuclear spins</title><description>  The realization of a network of quantum registers is an outstanding challenge
in quantum science and technology. We experimentally investigate a network node
that consists of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electronic spin
hyperfine-coupled to nearby nuclear spins. We demonstrate individual control
and readout of five nuclear spin qubits within one node. We then characterize
the storage of quantum superpositions in individual nuclear spins under
repeated application of a probabilistic optical inter-node entangling protocol.
We find that the storage fidelity is limited by dephasing during the electronic
spin reset after failed attempts. By encoding quantum states into a
decoherence-protected subspace of two nuclear spins we show that quantum
coherence can be maintained for over 1000 repetitions of the remote entangling
protocol. These results and insights pave the way towards remote entanglement
purification and the realisation of a quantum repeater using NV center quantum
network nodes.

electro- and optomechanical devices. Membrane resonators can achieve quality
factor ($Q$) - frequency ($f$) products exceeding $10^{13}$ Hz, enabling (in
principle) quantum coherent operation at room temperature. String-like beam
resonators possess conventionally 10 times smaller $Q\cdot f$ products;
however, on account of their much larger $Q$-to-mass ratio and reduced mode
density, they remain a canonical choice for precision force, mass, and charge
sensing, and have recently enabled Heisenberg-limited position measurements at
cryogenic temperatures. Here we explore two techniques to enhance the
$Q$-factor of a nanomechanical beam. The techniques relate to two main loss
mechanisms: internal loss, which dominates for large aspect ratios and
$f\lesssim100$ MHz, and radiation loss, which dominates for small aspect ratios
and $f\gtrsim100$ MHz. First we show that by embedding a nanobeam in a 1D
phononic crystal, it is possible to localize its flexural motion and shield it
against radiation loss. Using this method, we realize $f&gt;100$ MHz modes with
$Q\sim 10^4$, consistent with internal loss and contrasting sharply with
unshielded beams of similar dimensions. We then study the $Q\cdot f$ products
of high-order modes of mm-long nanobeams. Taking advantage of the mode-shape
dependence of stress-induced `loss-dilution', we realize a $f\approx 4$ MHz
mode with $Q\cdot f\approx9\cdot 10^{12}$ Hz. Our results can extend room
temperature quantum coherent operation to ultra-low-mass 1D nanomechanical
oscillators.

restrictions of equilibrium systems. Here we unveil how out-of-equilibrium
states, prepared via a quantum quench, can exhibit a non-zero Hall-type
response that persists at long times, and even when the instantaneous
Hamiltonian is time reversal symmetric; both these features starkly contrast
with equilibrium Hall currents. Interestingly, the persistent Hall effect
arises from processes beyond those captured by linear response, and is a
signature of the novel dynamics in out-of-equilibrium systems. We propose
quenches in two-band Dirac systems as natural venues to realize persistent Hall
currents, which exist when either mirror or time-reversal symmetry are broken
(before or after the quench). Its long time persistence, as well as sensitivity
to symmetry breaking, allow it to be used as a sensitive diagnostic of the
complex out-equilibrium dynamics readily controlled and probed in cold-atomic
optical lattice experiments.

  Spin-Space Density Matrix Approach</title><description>  In this paper, we investigate quantum correlation of an interacting Fermi
system, which is a nodal superconductor (d-wave superconductor) at zero
temperature, via quantum entanglement of two electron spins forming Cooper
pairs (Werner state), tripartite and quantum discord. After calculating
single-electron Green functions, the two-electron space-spin density matrix,
which has X-state form, is obtained. The dependence of quantum correlation to
the relative distance of electrons spins of Cooper pair and energy gap is
investigated. One of the results is, for d-wave case, concurrence (as a measure
of entanglement), quantum discord and tripartite are sensitive to the change of
magnitude of gap. Another result is both concurrence and discord oscillate.
Then, we consider three-dimensional rectangular nano-superconducting grain in
the weak coupling frame. The nano-size effect is entered via gap fluctuation.
The dependence of quantum correlation to length of superconductor and lower
bound of robustness of tripartite entanglement are determined. Moreover, we
show that quantum correlation of d-wave nano-size superconducting grain
strongly depends on length of grain (in contrast to s-wave case). In general,
it is found that the length of grain lower, the effect of nano-size on quantum
correlation higher. Quantum tripartite for nano-scale d-wave superconductor is
better than for bulk d-wave superconductor. However, we find out both bulk and
nano-size s-wave superconductors have the same tripartite. Furthermore,
entanglement length and quantum correlation length are investigated and it is
shown that there is a length of superconductor in which discord becomes zero.
Also, for a given fixed length of superconductor, both a peak in discord and a
peak in concurrence occur simultaneously.

$\rho=\sum_{k}w_{k}\rho_{k}$ in $d=2\times2$ are discussed. The equality
$G({\bf a},{\bf b})= 4[\langle \psi|P({\bf a})\otimes P({\bf
b})|\psi\rangle-\langle \psi|P({\bf a})\otimes{\bf 1}|\psi\rangle\langle
\psi|{\bf 1}\otimes P({\bf b})|\psi\rangle]=0$ for any two projection operators
$P({\bf a})$ and $P({\bf b})$ provides a necessary and sufficient separability
criterion in the case of a separable pure state
$\rho=|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|$. We propose the separability criteria of mixed
states, which are given by ${\rm Tr}\rho\{{\bf a}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\otimes {\bf
b}\cdot {\bf \sigma}\}=(1/3)C\cos\varphi$ for two spin $1/2$ systems and $4{\rm
Tr}\rho \{P({\bf a})\otimes P({\bf b})\}=1+(1/2)C\cos2\varphi$ for two photon
systems, respectively, after taking a geometrical angular average of ${\bf a}$
and ${\bf b}$ with fixed $\cos\varphi={\bf a}\cdot{\bf b}$. Here $-1\leq C\leq
1$, and the difference in the numerical coefficients $1/2$ and $1/3$ arises
from the different rotational properties of the spinor and the transverse
photon. If one instead takes an average over the states in the $d=2$ Hilbert
space, the criterion for two photon systems is replaced by $4{\rm Tr}\rho
\{P({\bf a})\otimes P({\bf b})\}=1+(1/3)C\cos2\varphi$.
  Those separability criteria are shown to be very efficient using the existing
experimental data of Aspect et al. in 1981 and Sakai et al. in 2006. When the
Werner state is applied to two photon systems, it is shown that the Hilbert
space average can judge its inseparability but not the geometrical angular
average.

potential applications in quantum chemistry, quantum computing and many-body
physics. The polarization potential between atoms and ions scales as 1/r^4 and
extends to 100's of nm. This long length-scale interaction can form macroscopic
objects while exhibiting quantum features such as Feshbach and shape resonances
at sufficiently low temperatures. So far, reaching the quantum regime of
atom-ion interaction has been impeded by the ion's excess micromotion (EMM)
which sets a scale for the steady-state energy. In this work, we studied the
dynamics of a ground-state cooled ion with negligible EMM during few, to many,
Langevin (spiraling) collisions with ultra-cold atoms. We measured the energy
distribution of the ion using both coherent (Rabi) and non-coherent (photon
scattering) spectroscopy. We observed a clear deviation from a
Maxwell-Boltzmann thermal distribution to a Tsallis energy distribution
characterized by a power-law tail of high energies. Unlike previous
experiments, here the energy scale of atom-ion interactions is not determined
by either the atomic cloud temperature or the EMM energy. In fact, it is
determined by the force the atom exerts on the ion during a collision which is
then amplified by the trap dynamics. This effect is intrinsic to ion Paul traps
and sets the lower bound of atom-ion steady-state interaction energy in these
systems. We also show that, even though the ion's mean energy diverges due to
the long tail of the energy distribution, the energy transfer per collision is
relatively small. Therefore, despite the fact that our system is eventually
driven out of the ultra-cold regime, we are, in principle, capable of studying
quantum effects by limiting the interaction time to the first few collisions.

filter. In this article, we introduce a quantum extended Kalman filter (quantum
EKF), which applies a commutative approximation and a time-varying
linearization to non-commutative quantum stochastic differential equations

the classical EKF can be implemented for quantum systems. The boundedness of
estimation errors and the filtering problems with `state-dependent' covariances

states of a system of interest (preventing access to complementary information
about their superpositions) and can make records of this information accessible
to many observers. This redundancy explains the emergence of objective,
classical reality in our quantum Universe. Here, we demonstrate that the
amplification of information in realistic spin environments can be quantified
by the quantum Chernoff information, which characterizes the distinguishability
of partial records in individual environment subsystems. We show that, except
for a set of initial states of measure zero, the environment always acquires
redundant information. Moreover, the Chernoff information captures the rich
behavior of amplification in both finite and infinite spin environments, from
quadratic growth of the redundancy to oscillatory behavior. These results will
considerably simplify experimental testing of quantum Darwinism, e.g., using

shown to undergo a decoherence process at a rate determined by the
gravitational acceleration. By assuming Einstein's Equivalence Principle to be
valid, we demonstrate, first in a Lorentz frame with accelerating detectors,
and then directly in the Lab frame with uniform gravity, that the dephasing
between the different internal states arise not from gravity but rather from
differences in their rest mass, and the mass dependence of the de Broglie
wave's dispersion relation. We provide an alternative view to the situation
considered by Ref. [1], where we propose that gravity plays a kinematic role in
the loss of fringe visibility by giving the detector a transverse velocity
relative to the particle beam; visibility can be easily recovered by giving the
screen an appropriate uniform velocity. We finally propose that dephasing due
to gravity may in fact take place for certain modifications to the

QED phenomena. An example of such a phenomenon is a dynamical Lamb effect which
is a parametric excitation of an atom due to the nonadiabatic modulation of its
Lamb shift. This effect has been initially introduced for a natural atom in a
varying cavity, while we suggested its realization in a superconducting
qubit-cavity system with dynamically tunable coupling. In the present paper, we
study the interplay between the dynamical Lamb effect and the energy
dissipation, which is unavoidable in realistic systems. We find that despite of
naive expectations this interplay can lead to unexpected dynamical regimes. One
of the most striking results is that photon generation from vacuum can be
strongly enhanced due to the qubit relaxation, which opens a new channel for
such a process. We also show that dissipation in the cavity can increase the
qubit excited state population. Our results can be used for the experimental
observation and investigation of the dynamical Lamb effect and accompanying

states. The relative phase and time-delay maps are then calculated between the
two-photon wavepackets created along symmetrical locations of the crystals.
Assuming monochromatic plane-wave pump field, the mutual signal-idler relations
like energy conservation and transverse-momentum conservation define well one
of the two-photon with reference to its conjugate. The weaker conservation of
longitudinal momentum (due to relatively thin crystals) allows two-photon
emission directions coplanar with the pump beam while spreading around the
perfect phase-matching direction. While prior works often adopt first-order
approximation, it is shown that the relative-phase map is a very well
approximated to a quadratic function in the polar angle of the two-photon
emission while negligibly varying with the azimuthal angle.

walk. The postulates of quantum theory, in particular the collapse of the wave
function upon measurement, reveal an intimate connection between the wave
function of a process free of measurements, i.e. the solution of the
Schr\&quot;odinger equation, and the statistics of first detection events on a site.
For stroboscopic measurements a quantum renewal equation yields basic
properties of quantum walks. For example, for a tight binding model on a ring
we discover critical sampling times, diverging quantities such as the mean time
for first detection, and an optimal detection rate. For a quantum walk on an
infinite line the probability of first detection decays like
$(\mbox{time})^{-3}$ with a superimposed oscillation, critical behavior for a
specific choice of sampling time, and vanishing amplitude when the sampling
time approaches zero due to the quantum Zeno effect.

  optical chaos</title><description>  In this paper, we numerically demonstrate a new extraction scheme for
generating ultra-fast physically random sequence of bits. For this purpose, we
utilize a dual-channel optical chaos source with suppressed time delayed (TD)
signature in both the intensity and the phase of its two channels. The proposed
technique uses M 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to compare the level
of the chaotic intensity signal at time t with its levels after incommensurable
delay-interval Tm, where m = {1,2,...,M}. The binary output of each 1-bit ADC
is then sampled by a positive-edge-triggered D flip-flop. The clock sequence
applied to the flip-flops is relatively delayed such that the rising edge of
the clock triggering the m flip-flop precedes the rising edge of the clock of a
subsequent m+1 flip-flop by a fixed period. The outputs of all flip-flops are
then combined by means of a parity-check logic. Numerical simulations are
carried out using values of parameters at which TD signature is suppressed for
chosen values of setup parameters. The 15 statistical tests in Special
Publication 800-22 from NIST are applied to the generated random bits in order
to examine the randomness quality of these bits for different values of M. The
results show that all tests are passed from M = 1 to M = 39 at sampling rate up
to 34.5 GHz which indicates that the maximum generation rate of random bits is
2.691 Tb/sec using a chaotic source of single VCSEL and without employing any
pre-processing techniques.

communication complexity, quantum communication allows the advantage of an
exponential reduction in the information transmitted over classical
communication to accomplish distributed computational tasks. However, to date,
demonstrating this advantage in a practical setting continues to be a central

fingerprinting protocol that for the first time surpasses the ultimate
classical limit to transmitted information. Ultra-low noise superconducting
single-photon detectors and a stable fibre-based Sagnac interferometer are used
to implement a quantum fingerprinting system that is capable of transmitting
less information than the classical proven lower bound over 20 km standard
telecom fibre for input sizes of up to two Gbits. The results pave the way for

particle to be confined in a number of possible trapping sites, with precise
localization at the anti-nodes of the optical standing wave. By studying the
motion of a particle which has been moved to an adjacent trapping site, the
known spacing of the lattice anti-nodes can be used to calibrate the

  without signaling</title><description>  We understand emergent quantum mechanics in the sense that quantum mechanics
describes processes of physical emergence relating an assumed sub-quantum
physics to macroscopic boundary conditions. The latter can be shown to entail
top-down causation, in addition to usual bottom-up scenarios. With this example
it is demonstrated that definitions of &quot;realism&quot; in the literature are simply
too restrictive. A prevailing manner to define realism in quantum mechanics is
in terms of pre-determination independent of the measurement. With our
counter-example, which actually is ubiquitous in emergent, or self-organizing,
systems, we argue for realism without pre-determination. We refer to earlier
results of our group showing how the guiding equation of the de Broglie-Bohm
interpretation can be derived from a theory with classical ingredients only.
Essentially, this corresponds to a &quot;quantum mechanics without wave functions&quot;
in ordinary 3-space, albeit with nonlocal correlations.
  This, then, leads to the central question of how to deal with the nonlocality
problem in a relativistic setting. We here show that a basic argument
discussing the allegedly paradox time ordering of events in EPR-type
two-particle experiments falls short of taking into account the contextuality
of the experimental setup. Consequently, we then discuss under which
circumstances (i.e. physical premises) superluminal information transfer (but
not signaling) may be compatible with a Lorentz-invariant theory. Finally, we
argue that the impossibility of superluminal signaling - despite the presence
of superluminal information transfer - is not the result of some sort of
conspiracy (a la &quot;Nature likes to hide&quot;), but the consequence of the
impossibility to exactly reproduce in repeated experimental runs a state's
preparation, or of the no-cloning theorem, respectively.

applications. Quantum noise is becoming a major limiting factor to such a task
in future technology, especially in optomechanics for temperature, stochastic
gravitational wave, and decoherence measurements. Motivated by this concern,
here we prove a measurement-independent quantum limit to the accuracy of
estimating the spectrum parameters of a classical stochastic process coupled to
a quantum dynamical system. We demonstrate our results by analyzing the data
from a continuous optical phase estimation experiment and showing that the
experimental performance with homodyne detection is close to the quantum limit.
We further propose a spectral photon counting method that can attain
quantum-optimal performance for weak modulation and a coherent-state input,
with an error scaling superior to that of homodyne detection at low

alternatively determine a positive, completely positive, entanglement-breaking

solvable. As an example of this richness, PPT but not entanglement-breaking
maps are found. A simple example of a positive yet indecomposable map is
provided. Then, the study of the entanglement-annihilating property is fully

In order to compare those three quantum walk models, we put them in the

with the accessible information in the quantum compass state which we show is
always upper bounded by a constant, independent of the number of photons.

ascribing the selection of a variable fraction R of the information that
specifies the random outcome of the initial measurement to the final

(Alice), of maximal ignorance of the problem setting that to her should be
hidden, would consequently be projected on a state of lower entropy where she
knows in advance an R-th part of the setting (i. e. of the information that

out to be a sum over classical histories in each of which Alice knows in
advance one of the possible R-th parts of the problem setting and performs the
Q(R) computations (oracle queries) still needed to find the solution. Grover's
search problem can be solved with any value of R from 0 to about 1/2, when the

quantum algorithms examined, R is close to 1/2 and Q(1/2) yields the order of

plausible, given any oracle problem we would know the order of magnitude of the

us to efficiently optimize over this ansatz class. We test this method on spin

addition, we identify ribbons in the abelian phase of Kitaev's honeycomb model
which serve as the logical operators of the encoded qubit for the quantum

context of the Born- Oppenheimer approximation they lead to an explicit formula
that can be used to predict transitions at avoided crossings. Based on this
formula, we present a simple method for computing wave packet dynamics across
avoided crossings. Only knowledge of the adiabatic electronic energy levels
near the avoided crossing is required for the computation. In particular, this
means that no diabatization procedure is necessary, the adiabatic energy levels
can be computed on the fly, and they only need to be computed to higher
accuracy when an avoided crossing is detected. We test the quality of our
method on the paradigmatic example of photo-dissociation of NaI, finding very
good agreement with results of exact wave packet calculations.

  Markovian and non-Markovian environments</title><description>  We provide an analytical investigation of the pairwise entanglement dynamics
for a system, consisting an arbitrary number of qubits dissipating into a
common and non-Markovian environment for both weak and strong coupling regimes.
In the latter case, a revival of pairwise entanglement due to the memory depth
of the environment is observed. The leakage of photons into a continuum state
is assumed to be the source of dissipation. We show that for an initially
Werner state, the environment washes out the pairwise entanglement, but a
series of non-selective measurements can protect the relevant entanglement. On
the other hand, by limiting the number of qubits initially in the superposition
of single excitation, a stationary entanglement can be created between qubits
initially in the excited and ground states. Finally, we determine the
stationary distribution of the entanglement versus the total number of qubits
in the system.

generically, the growth of quantum entanglement with time to an amount
proportional to the system size (volume law) even when the interactions are
local. This phenomenon, unobserved to date, has great ramifications for
fundamental issues such as thermalisation and black-hole formation, while its
optimisation clearly has an impact on technology (e.g., for on-chip quantum
networking). Here we use an integrated photonic chip to simulate the dynamics
of a spin chain, a canonical many-body system. A digital approach is used to
engineer the evolution so as to maximise the generation of entanglement. The
resulting volume law growth of entanglement is certified by constructing a
second chip, which simultaneously measures the entanglement between multiple
distant pairs of simulated spins. This is the first experimental verification
of the volume law and opens up the use of photonic circuits as a unique tool
for the optimisation of quantum devices.

quantum computations in the presence of imprecision and imperfections of
realistic devices. An important question is to find the noise rate at which
errors can be arbitrarily suppressed. By concatenating the 7-qubit Steane and
15-qubit Reed-Muller codes, the 105-qubit code enables a universal set of
fault-tolerant gates despite not all of them being transversal. Importantly,
the CNOT gate remains transversal in both codes, and as such has increased
error protection relative to the other single qubit logical gates. We show that
while the level-1 pseudo-threshold for the concatenated scheme is limited by
the logical Hadamard, the error suppression of the logical CNOT gates allows
for the asymptotic threshold to increase by orders of magnitude at higher

from propagating fields $E(x) \propto e^{\pm ik_x x}$ outside the bandgap to

accompanied by a transition from largely dissipative atom-atom interactions to

correlations, when monogamy scores are considered as observables, and
three-qubit systems are subjected to global noise and various local noisy
channels, namely, amplitude-damping, phase-damping, and depolarizing channels.
We show that the dynamics of monogamy scores corresponding to negativity and
quantum discord, in the case of generalized W states, as inputs to the noisy
channels, can exhibit non-monotonic dynamics with respect to increasing noise
parameter, which is in contrast to the monotonic decay of monogamy scores when
generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states are exposed to noise. We
quantify the persistence of monogamy against noise via a characteristic value
of the noise parameter, and show that depolarizing noise destroys monogamy of
quantum correlation faster compared to other noisy channels. We demonstrate
that the negativity monogamy score is more robust than the quantum discord
monogamy score, when the noise is of the phase-damping type. We also
investigate the variation of monogamy with increasing noise for arbitrary
three-qubit pure states as inputs. Finally, depending on these results, we
propose a two-step protocol, which can conclusively identify the type of noise
applied to the quantum system, by using generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger

relational image of the cosmos? One key motivation for adopting the concept of
emergence in relation to quantum theory concerns the persistent failure in
standard physics to unify the two pillars in the foundations of physics:
quantum theory and general relativity theory (GRT). The total contradiction in
the foundational, metaphysical assumptions that define orthodox quantum theory
versus GRT might render inter-theoretic unification impossible. On the one
hand, indeterminism and non-causality define orthodox quantum mechanics, and,
on the other hand, GRT is governed by causality and determinism. How could
these two metaphysically-contradictory theories ever be reconciled? The present
work argues that metaphysical contradiction necessarily implies physical
contradiction. The contradictions are essentially responsible also for the
measurement problem in quantum mechanics. A common foundation may be needed for
overcoming the contradictions between the two foundational theories. The
concept of emergence, and the development of an EmQM, might help advance a

determining the non-trivial value by which the monogamy inequality can be
violated by a quantum correlation measure. Using an information-theoretic
complementarity relation between the normalized purity and quantum correlation
in any given multiparty state, we obtain a non-trivial lower bound on the

the three-qubit states the lower bound is equal to the negative von Neumann

The slowing down of fluorescence is due to the excitation of spatially

problems are of the anharmonic oscillator type with a special type of
anharmonicity. The Hamiltonians of quasi-exactly-solvable problems are
characterized by the existence of a hidden algebraic structure but do not have
any hidden symmetry properties. In particular, all known one-dimensional
(quasi)-exactly-solvable problems possess a hidden $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\bf{R})-$
Lie algebra. They are equivalent to the $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\bf{R})$ Euler-Arnold
quantum top in a constant magnetic field. Quasi-Exactly Solvable problems are
highly non-trivial, they shed light on delicate analytic properties of the
Schr\&quot;odinger Equations in coupling constant. The Lie-algebraic formalism
allows us to make a link between the Schr\&quot;odinger Equations and
finite-difference equations on uniform and/or exponential lattices, it implies
that the spectra is preserved. This link takes the form of quantum canonical
transformation. The corresponding isospectral spectral problems for
finite-difference operators are described. The underlying Fock space formalism
giving rise to this correspondence is uncovered. For a quite general class of
perturbations of unperturbed problems with the hidden Lie algebra property we
can construct an algebraic perturbation theory, where the wavefunction
corrections are of polynomial nature, thus, can be found by algebraic means.

optical dispersion and density of states, and have thus been employed for
applications from photon generation to quantum sensing with NVs and atoms. The
unique control afforded by these media make them a beautiful, if unexplored,
playground for strong coupling quantum electrodynamics, where a single, highly
nonlinear emitter hybridizes with the band structure of the crystal. In this
work we demonstrate that such hybridization can create localized cavity modes
that live within the photonic band-gap, whose localization and spectral
properties we explore in detail. We then demonstrate that the coloured vacuum
of the photonic crystal can be employed for efficient dissipative state
preparation. This work opens exciting prospects for engineering long-range spin
models in the circuit QED architecture, as well as new opportunities for

Tensor networks have proven an important tool in attempting to overcome this

  These notes form the basis for a seven lecture course, introducing the basics
of a range of common tensor networks and algorithms. In particular, we cover:
introductory tensor network notation, applications to quantum information,
basic properties of matrix product states, a classification of quantum phases
using tensor networks, algorithms for finding matrix product states, basic
properties of projected entangled pair states, and multiscale entanglement
renormalisation ansatz states.
  The lectures are intended to be generally accessible, although the relevance
of many of the examples may be lost on students without a background in
many-body physics/quantum information. For each lecture, several problems are

the same ontology of classical mechanics: particles following continuous
trajectories in space through time. For this ontological continuity, it seems
to be a good candidate for recovering the classical limit of quantum theory.
Indeed, in a Bohmian framework, the issue of the classical limit reduces to
showing how classical trajectories can emerge from Bohmian ones, under specific
classicality assumptions. In this paper, we shall focus on a technical problem
that arises from the dynamics of a Bohmian system in bounded regions; and we
suggest that a possible solution is supplied by the action of environmental
decoherence. However, we shall show that, in order to implement decoherence in
a Bohmian framework, a stronger condition is required (disjointness of
supports) rather than the usual one (orthogonality of states).

  application to fault diagnosis</title><description>  Current quantum annealing (QA) hardware suffers from practical limitations
such as finite temperature, sparse connectivity, small qubit numbers, and
control error. We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint
satisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In
particular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a
hardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two
new decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly
into hardware.
  The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising
models are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in
different constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In
contrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising
model for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to
generate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of
CSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local
mapping technique is significantly better than global embedding.
  We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based
fault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is
typically able to find all solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N
using 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a
leading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms
to find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than
can be solved directly on current hardware.

  distribution</title><description>  The role of the side channels in the continuous-variable quantum key
distribution is studied. It is shown how the information leakage through a side
channel from the trusted sender station increases the vulnerability of the
protocols to the eavesdropping in the main quantum communication channel.
Moreover, the untrusted noise infusion by an eavesdropper on the trusted
receiving side breaks the security even for a purely attenuating main quantum
channel. As a method to compensate for the effect of the side-channel leakage
on the sender side, we suggest several types of manipulations on the
side-channel input. It is shown that by applying the modulated coherent light
on the input of the side channel that is optimally correlated to the modulation
on the main signal and optionally, introducing additional squeezing in the case
of the squeezed-state protocol, the negative influence of the lossy side
channel on the sender side can be completely removed. For the trusted receiving
side, the method of optimal monitoring of the residual noise from the
side-channel noise infusion is suggested and shown to be able to completely
eliminate the presence of the noisy side channel. We therefore prove that the
side-channel effects can be completely removed using feasible operations if the
trusted parties access the respective parts of the side channels.

  beams</title><description>  We have proposed a unified framework towards the dynamics of optical and
electron vortex beams from the perspective of geometric phase and the
associated Hall effects. The unification is attributed to the notion that the
spin degrees of freedom of a relativistic particle, either massive or massless,
is associated with a vortex line. %The formulation in cylindrical coordinates
leads to a local vortex structure related to orbital angular momentum(OAM).
Based on cylindrical corodinate formulation, which leads to a local vortex
structure related to orbital angular momentum (OAM), it can be shown that when
electron vortex beams (EVBs) move in an external electric field paraxial beams
give rise to OAM Hall effect and non-paraxial beams with tilted vortices
initiate spin Hall effect in free space as well as in an external field. A
similar analysis reveals that the paraxial optical vortex beams(OVBs) in an
inhomogeneous medium induce OAM Hall effect whereas non-paraxial beams with
tilted vortices drive the spin Hall effect. Moreover, both OVBs and EVBs with
tilted vortices give rise to OAM states with arbitrary fractional value.

that have been proposed as building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers
[1]. They are expected to exhibit non-Abelian particle statistics, in contrast
to the usual statistics of fermions and bosons, enabling quantum operations to
be performed by braiding isolated modes around one another. Quantum braiding
operations are topologically protected insofar as these modes are pinned near
zero energy, and the pinning is predicted to be exponential as the modes become
spatially separated. Following theoretical proposals, several experiments have
identified signatures of Majorana modes in proximitized nanowires and atomic
chains, with small mode-splitting potentially explained by hybridization of
Majoranas. Here, we use Coulomb-blockade spectroscopy in an InAs nanowire
segment with epitaxial aluminum, which forms a proximity-induced
superconducting Coulomb island (a Majorana island) that is isolated from
normal-metal leads by tunnel barriers, to measure the splitting of
near-zero-energy Majorana modes. We observe exponential suppression of energy
splitting with increasing wire length. For short devices of a few hundred
nanometers, sub-gap state energies oscillate as the magnetic field is varied,
as is expected for hybridized Majorana modes. Splitting decreases by a factor
of about ten for each half micrometer of increased wire length. For devices
longer than about one micrometer, transport in strong magnetic fields occurs
through a zero-energy state that is energetically isolated from a continuum,
yielding uniformly spaced Coulomb-blockade conductance peaks, consistent with
teleportation via Majorana modes. Our results help explain the
trivial-to-topological transition in finite systems and to quantify the scaling
of topological protection with end-mode separation.

  Schemes</title><description>  The need for secrecy and security is essential in communication. Secret
sharing is a conventional protocol to distribute a secret message to a group of
parties, who cannot access it individually but need to cooperate in order to
decode it. While several variants of this protocol have been investigated,
including realizations using quantum systems, the security of quantum secret
sharing schemes against eavesdroppers and dishonest participants remained
unproven. Here we establish an unconditional security proof for continuous

asymptotic keys and for an arbitrary number of players, by utilizing ideas from
the recently developed one-sided device-independent approach to quantum key
distribution. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of our scheme, which can

ideal single-photon sources or quantum memories. Our results establish quantum

determine the effective $V_{ab}(N)$ electronic coupling between emitter and
receiver states through the bus as a function of the number $N$ of parallel
lines in the bus. When the calculation of $V_{ab}(N)$ is spectrally difficult,
an Heisenberg-Rabi time dependent quantum exchange process can be triggered
through the bus by preparing a specific initial non-stationanry state and
identifying a target state to capture the effective oscillation frequency
$\Omega_{ab}(N)$ between those. For $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ (for $V_{ab}(N)$), two
different regimes are observed as a function of $N$: linear and $\sqrt{N}$ more
moderate increases. This state preparation was remplaced by electronically
coupling the quantum bus to two semi-infinite electrodes. The native quantum
transduction process at work in this tunnel junction is not faithfully
following the $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ variations with $N$. Due to normalisation to
unity of the electronic transparency of the quantum bus and to the low pass
filter character of the transduction, large $\Omega_{ab}(N)$ cannot be followed
by the tunnel junction. At low coupling and when $N$ is small enough not to
compensate the small through line coupling, an $N^2$ power law is preserved for
$\Omega_{ab}(N)$. The limitations of the quantum transduction in a tunnel

a metallic nanopad and a molecular wire can be better described as a quantum

dichotomy for entanglement depth: an $N$-particle symmetric state is either
fully separable, or fully entangled---the entanglement depth is either $1$ or
$N$. This property is even stable under non-symmetric noise. We propose an
experimentally accessible method to detect entanglement depth in atomic
ensembles based on a bound on the particle number population of Dicke states,
and demonstrate that the entanglement depth of some Dicke states, for example
the twin Fock state, is very stable even under a large arbitrary noise. Our
observation can be applied to atomic Bose-Einstein condensates to infer that
these systems can be highly entangled with the entanglement depth that is of
the order of the system size (i.e. several thousands of atoms).

  the reality of experimenter free will</title><description>  The concept of 'super-indeterminism' captures the notion that the free choice
assumption of orthodox quantum mechanics necessitates only the following
requirement: an agent's free-choice performance in the selection of measurement
settings must not represent an exception to the rule of irreducible quantum
indeterminism in the physical universe (i.e, &quot;universal indeterminism&quot;). Any
additional metaphysical speculation, such as to whether quantum indeterminism,
i.e., intrinsic randomness, implicates the reality of experimenter &quot;freedom&quot;,
&quot;free will&quot;, or &quot;free choice&quot;, is redundant in relation to the predictive
success of orthodox quantum mechanics. Accordingly, super-indeterminism views
as redundant also, from a technical standpoint, whether an affirmative or a
negative answer is claimed in reference to universal indeterminism as a
necessary precondition for experimenter freedom. Super-indeterminism accounts,
for example, for the circular reasoning which is implicit in the free will
theorem by Conway and Kochen. The concept of super-indeterminism is of great
assistance in clarifying the often misunderstood meaning of the concept of
&quot;free variables&quot; as used by John Bell. The present work argues that Bell sought
an operational, effective free will theorem, one based upon the notion of
&quot;determinism without predetermination&quot;, i.e., one wherein &quot;free variables&quot;
represent universally uncomputable variables. In conclusion, the standard
interpretation of quantum theory does not answer, and does not need to answer
in order to ensure the predictive success of orthodox theory, the question of
whether either incompatibilism or compatibilism is valid in relation to
free-will metaphysics and to the free-will phenomenology of experimenter agents
in quantum mechanics.

transverse Ising chain and the measurement performed is, whether the total

(MA-MDI-QKD) has recently been proposed as a possible intermediate step towards
the realization of quantum repeaters. Despite its relaxing some of the
requirements on quantum memories, the choice of memory in relation to the
layout of the setup and the protocol has a stark e?ect on our ability to beat
existing no-memory systems. Here, a variant of MA-MDI-QKD that relies on
nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers as its quantum memories is proposed. We
particularly focus on the cavity-enhanced NV centers and show that, in terms of
the secret key rate per transmitted pulse, we can beat the existing no-memory
QKD systems by up to three orders of magnitude. Using system parameters
achievable by the today's state of the art, we then anticipate some total key

accounts for major sources of error including the dark current, the channel

means of Floquet theory we show that, for any subchain, the entanglement
entropy tends asymptotically to a value $\tau$ - periodic in time. We provide a
semi-analytical formula for the leading term of this asymptotic regime: It is
constant in time and obeys a volume law. The entropy in the asymptotic regime
is always smaller than the thermal one: because of integrability the system
locally relaxes to a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE) density matrix. The
leading term of the asymptotic entanglement entropy is completely determined by
this GGE density matrix. Remarkably, the asymptotic entropy shows marked

long-range interactions which includes as particular cases the su$(1|1)$
Inozemtsev (elliptic) and Haldane-Shastry chains, as well as the XX model. We
show that this class of models can be fermionized with the help of the
algebraic properties of the su$(1|1)$ permutation operator, and take advantage
of this fact to analyze their quantum criticality when a chemical potential
term is present in the Hamiltonian. We first study the low energy excitations
and the low temperature behavior of the free energy, which coincides with that
of a $(1+1)$-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$
when the chemical potential lies in the critical interval $(0,\mathcal
E(\pi))$, $\mathcal E(p)$ being the dispersion relation. We also analyze the
von Neumann and R\'enyi ground state entanglement entropies, showing that they
exhibit the logarithmic scaling with the size of the block of spins
characteristic of a one-boson $(1+1)$-dimensional CFT. Our results thus show
that the models under study are quantum critical when the chemical potential
belongs to the critical interval, with central charge $c=1$. From the analysis
of the fermion density at zero temperature, we also conclude that there is a
quantum phase transition at both ends of the critical interval. This is further
confirmed by the behavior of the fermion density at finite temperature, which
is studied analytically (at low temperature), as well as numerically for the
su$(1|1)$ elliptic chain.

  with relaxation</title><description>  Hysteresis can be found in driven many-body systems such as magnets and
superfluids. Rate-dependent hysteresis arises when a system is driven
periodically while relaxing towards equilibrium. A two-state paramagnet driven
by an oscillating magnetic field in the relaxation approximation clearly
demonstrates rate-dependent hysteresis. A noninteracting atomic Fermi gas in an
optical ring potential, when driven by a periodic artificial gauge field and
subjected to dissipation, is shown to exhibit hysteresis loops of atomic
current due to a competition of the driving time and the relaxation time. This
is in contrast to electronic systems exhibiting equilibrium persistent current
driven by magnetic flux due to rapid relaxation. Universal behavior of the
dissipated energy in one hysteresis loop is observed in both the magnetic and
atomic systems, showing linear and inverse-linear dependence on the relaxation
time in the strong and weak dissipation regimes. While interactions in general
invalidate the framework for rate-dependent hysteresis, an atomic Fermi gas
with artificial spin-orbit coupling exhibits hysteresis loops of atomic
currents. Cold-atoms in ring-shape potentials are thus promising in
demonstrating rate-dependent hysteresis and its associated phenomena.

\onlinecite{mfmc2} by an explicit counter-example. Here, we show that the
conjecture is almost true, in that the ratio of the quantum max-flow to the
quantum min-cut converges to $1$ as the dimension $N$ of the degrees of freedom
on the edges of the network tends to infinity. The proof is based on estimating
moments of the singular values of the network. We introduce a generalization of
&quot;rainbow diagrams&quot;\cite{rainbow} to tensor networks to estimate the dominant

ratio of the quantum max-flow to the quantum min-cut by a constant. To show the
tighter bound that the ratio tends to $1$, we consider higher moments. In

such photonic integrated circuits to on-chip networks of increasing complexity.
Second order nonlinear materials are the method of choice for generating

essential primitive in quantum information science. In quantum optics, remote
entanglement experiments provides one approach for loophole-free tests of
quantum non-locality and form the basis for the modular architecture of quantum
computing. In these experiments, the two qubits, Alice and Bob, are each first
entangled with a traveling photon. Subsequently, the two photons paths
interfere on a beam-splitter before being directed to single-photon detectors.
Such concurrent remote entanglement protocols using discrete Fock states can be
made robust to photon losses, unlike schemes that rely on continuous variable
states. This robustness arises from heralding the entanglement on the detection
of events which can be selected for their unambiguity. However, efficiently
detecting single photons is challenging in the domain of superconducting
quantum circuits because of the low energy of microwave quanta. Here, we report
the realization of a novel microwave photon detector implemented in the circuit

to optimization problems. Most problems exhibit complete connectivity between
the logical spin variables after they are mapped to the Ising spin Hamiltonian
of quantum annealing. To account for hardware constraints of current and future
physical quantum annealers, methods enabling the embedding of fully connected
graphs of logical spins into a constant-degree graph of physical spins are
therefore essential. Here, we compare the recently proposed embedding scheme
for quantum annealing with all-to-all connectivity due to Lechner, Hauke and
Zoller (LHZ) [Science Advances 1 (2015)] to the commonly used minor embedding
(ME) scheme. Using both simulated quantum annealing and parallel tempering
simulations, we find that for a set of instances randomly chosen from a class
of fully connected, random Ising problems, the ME scheme outperforms the LHZ
scheme when using identical simulation parameters, despite the fault tolerance
of the latter to weakly correlated spin-flip noise. This result persists even
after we introduce several decoding strategies for the LHZ scheme, including a
minimum-weight decoding algorithm that results in substantially improved
performance over the original LHZ scheme. We explain the better performance of
the ME scheme in terms of more efficient spin updates, which allows it to
better tolerate the correlated spin-flip errors that arise in our model of
quantum annealing. Our results leave open the question of whether the
performance of the two embedding schemes can be improved using scheme-specific

communication model equals the logarithm of the support rank of the
corresponding tensor, whereas the approximation complexity in this model equals
the logarithm of the border support rank. This characterisation allows us to
prove a log-rank conjecture posed by Villagra et al. for nondeterministic
multiparty quantum communication with message-passing.
  The support rank characterization of the communication model connects quantum
communication complexity intimately to the theory of asymptotic entanglement
transformation and algebraic complexity theory. In this context, we introduce
the graphwise equality problem. For a cycle graph, the complexity of this
communication problem is closely related to the complexity of the computational
problem of multiplying matrices, or more precisely, it equals the logarithm of
the asymptotic support rank of the iterated matrix multiplication tensor. We

nontrivial protocols for every odd-player cyclic equality problem. We exhibit
an efficient protocol for the 5-player problem for small inputs, and we show
how Young flattenings yield nontrivial complexity lower bounds.

critical to understand the different types of noise affecting quantum control.
The ability to distinguish coherent and incoherent error is extremely useful,
as these errors contribute differently to the fault tolerance threshold, but
coherent error is generally easier to reduce at the hardware level. In this
work, we characterize the quantum control of a single (ensemble) qubit via
solid-state pulsed electron spin resonance (ESR). We use randomized
benchmarking (RB) together with purity benchmarking (PB) to quantify the total
error and the incoherent error in a set of Clifford gates. The lowest error
rates are achieved when the transfer function of the pulsed ESR control system
is carefully accounted for, and we find that incoherent errors make up the
majority of the total error. The robustness of RB to gate-dependent noise is
investigated by using gate-set tomography and numerical simulations, where it
is found that RB and PB are surprisingly robust.

interpretations prevailed: the meaning of the theory was expressed in terms of
measurements results. But in the last decades, several attempts to interpret it
from a realist viewpoint have been proposed. Among them, modal interpretations
supply a realist non-collapse account, according to which the system always has
definite properties and the quantum state represents possibilities, not
actualities. However, the traditional modal interpretations faced some
conceptual problems when addressing imperfect measurements. The
modal-Hamiltonian interpretation, on the contrary, proved to be able to supply
an adequate account of the measurement problem, both in its ideal and its
non-ideal versions. Moreover, in the non-ideal case, it gives a precise
criterion to distinguish between reliable and non-reliable measurements.
Nevertheless, that criterion depends on the particular state of the measured
system, and this might be considered as a shortcoming of the proposal. In fact,
one could ask for a criterion of reliability that does not depend on the
features of what is measured but only on the properties of the measurement
device. The aim of this article is precisely to supply such a criterion: we

the exactly solvable Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model and its generalization to
finite JC-lattices that finite component systems of coupled spins and bosons
may exhibit quantum phase transitions (QPT). For the JC-model we find a
continuous symmetry-breaking QPT, a photonic condensate with a macroscopic
occupation as the ground state and a Goldstone mode as a low-energy excitation.
For the two site JC-lattice we show analytically that it undergoes a
Mott-insulator to superfluid QPT. We identify as the underlying principle of
the emergence of finite size QPT the combination of increasing atomic energy
and increasing interaction strength between the atom and the bosonic mode which
allows for the exploration of an increasingly large portion of the infinite
dimensional Hilbert space of the bosonic mode. This suggests that finite system

theorem is generally responsible for the interest in alternative universality
constructions including magic state distillation. Widely overlooked, however,
is the possibility of non-transversal, yet still fault-tolerant, gates that
work directly on small quantum codes. Here we demonstrate precisely the
existence of such gates. In particular, we show how the limits of
non-transversality can be overcome by performing rounds of intermediate
error-correction to create logical gates on stabilizer codes that use no
ancillas other than those required for syndrome measurement. Moreover, the
logical gates we construct, the most prominent examples being Toffoli and
controlled-controlled-Z, often complete universal gate sets on their codes. We
detail such universal constructions for the smallest quantum codes, the 5-qubit

result of this generalization is that any nondegenerate stabilizer code with a
complete set of fault-tolerant single-qubit Clifford gates has a universal set
of fault-tolerant gates. Another is the interaction of logical qubits across
different stabilizer codes, which, for instance, implies a broadly applicable
method of code switching.

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 7 (2012)], Takemoto et al. [Journal of Chemical Physics
137 1 (2012)] Machnes et al. [Journal of Chemical Physics, accepted (2016)]),
we have introduced two key new elements into the method: a formalism for
converging the basis and for efficient pruning by use of the biorthogonal
basis. In this paper we review the key components of the theory and then
present new, efficient and parallelizable iterative algorithms for solving the
time-independent and time-dependent Schr\&quot;odinger equations. The algorithms
dynamically determine the active reduced basis iteratively without resorting to
classical analogs. These algorithmic developments, combined with the previous
formal developments, allow quantum dynamics to be performed directly and
economically in phase space. We provide two illustrative examples: double-well
tunneling and double ionization of helium.

between sender and receiver as a resource. We apply the same framework to
quantum metrology, introducing shared entanglement between the preparation and
the measurement stage, namely using some entangled ancillary system that does
not interact with the system to be sampled. This is known to be useless in the
noiseless case, but was recently shown to be useful in the presence of noise.
Here we detail how and when it can be of use. For example, surprisingly it is
useful when randomly time sharing two channels where ancillas do not help
(depolarizing). We show that it is useful for all levels of noise for many
noise models and propose a simple experiment to test these results.

functions $\hat{U}(\theta)$ dependent on some parameter of interest $\theta$
has historically been more of an art than a science. Through inspired design, a
sequence of $L$ primitive gates also depending on $\theta$ can engineer a
highly nontrivial $\hat{U}(\theta)$ that enables myriad precision metrology,
spectroscopy, and control techniques. However, discovering new useful examples
of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ requires great intuition to perceive the possibilities,
and often brute-force to find optimal implementations. These demands hobble our
imagination of new applications. We present a systematic and efficient
methodology for composite gate design of arbitrary length, where
phase-controlled primitive gates all rotating by $\theta$ act on a single spin.
We fully characterize the realizable family of $\hat{U}(\theta)$, provide an
efficient algorithm that decomposes a choice of $\hat{U}(\theta)$ into its
shortest sequence of gates, and show how to efficiently choose achievable
$\hat{U}(\theta)$ that for fixed $L$, are optimal approximations to objective
functions on its quadratures. A strong connection is forged with
\emph{classical} discrete-time signal processing, allowing us to swiftly
construct, as examples, compensated gates with optimal bandwidth that implement
arbitrary single spin rotations with optimal sub-wavelength spatial
selectivity.

the functions they generate assuming the ability to swap qubits and use
ancillary workspace. Because we view these stabilizer circuits as subroutines
of some general quantum computation, we insist that any ancilla qubits used
during the computation must not change in an input-dependent manner. This is
the first attempt at a quantum extension of the classification of reversible
classical gates introduced by Aaronson et al., another part of an ambitious
program to classify all quantum gate sets.
  The classification uses, at its center, a reinterpretation of the tableau
representation of stabilizer gates to give circuit decompositions, from which
elementary generators can easily be extracted. There are a total of 57
different stabilizer classes generated in this way, 30 of which arise from the
single-qubit subgroups of the Clifford group. At a high level, the remaining
classes are arranged according to the bases they preserve. For instance, the
CNOT gate preserves the X and Z bases because it maps X-basis elements to
X-basis elements and Z-basis elements to Z-basis elements. The remaining
classes are characterized by more subtle tableau invariants; for instance, the
T_4 and phase gate generate a proper subclass of Z-preserving gates.

superballistic transport is not well understood but it has been experimentally
observed recently. We here calculate the white noise effect (in Markov
approximation) on the quantum diffusion in 1D tight-binding model with
disordered and quasi-periodic region of size L attached to perfect lattices at
both ends. Here we show the effect of white noise on spreading of the wave
packet initially located at the center of the sublattice. We find threshold
values of the white noise strength, beyond which the quantum hyperdiffusion
does not occur. We predict from our numerical studies that the quantum
hyperdiffusion exponent can be tuned by the strength of applied white noise.
Therefore we can manually apply noise to a system to drive it to desired

(280-400 mT) and low temperatures (2-70 K). The NV$^-$ centers in synthetic
type IIb diamonds (nitrogen impurity concentration $&lt;1$~ppm) are prepared with
bulk concentrations of $2\cdot 10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $4\cdot 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$
by high-energy electron irradiation and subsequent annealing. We find that a
proper post-radiation anneal (1000$^\circ$C for 60 mins) is critically
important to repair the radiation damage and to recover long electron spin
coherence times for NV$^-$s. After the annealing, spin coherence times of T$_2

naturally solved on a specialized photonic quantum simulator which requires
less resources than building a universal quantum computer. The biggest
challenge to implement boson sampling with a large number of photons has been
the lack of reliable single-photon sources. Here we demonstrate a scalable
architecture of boson sampling using a solid-state single-photon source with
simultaneously high efficiency, purity, and indistinguishability. The single
photons are time-bin encoded and interfered in an electrically programmable
loop-based network. We implement and validate boson sampling with input three

the circuit. With further refinement of the system efficiency, our approach may
be feasible to be scaled up to &gt;20-boson sampling to outperform classical

routine for preparing these small angle magic states. Our protocol builds on

it uses nearly half the resources to achieve the same output error rate. Direct
access to small angle rotations reduces the need for costly gate synthesis

approximately a factor of 40 compared to using gate synthesis, with some
variation depending on the parameter regime of interest.

  silicon vacancy centers in diamond</title><description>  Silicon-vacancy (SiV) centers in diamond are promising systems for quantum
information applications due to their bright single photon emission and
optically accessible spin states. Furthermore, SiV centers in low-strain
diamond are insensitive to pertubations of the dielectric environment, i.e.
they show very weak spectral diffusion. This property renders ensembles of SiV
centers interesting for sensing applications. We here report on
photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy on an SiV ensemble in a low
strain, CVD-grown high quality diamond layer, where we measure the fine
structure with high resolution and obtain the linewidths and splittings of the
SiV centers. We investigate the temperature dependence of the width and
position of the fine structure peaks. Our measurements reveal linewidths of
about 10 GHz as compared to a lifetime limited width on the order of 0.1 GHz.
This difference arises from the inhomogeneous broadening of the transitions
caused by residual strain. To overcome inhomogeneous broadening we use spectral
hole burning spectroscopy which enables us to measure a nearly lifetime limited
homogeneous linewidth of 279 MHz. Furthermore, we demonstrate evidence of
coherent interaction in the system by driving a $\Lambda$-scheme. Additional
measurements on single emitters created by ion implantation confirm the
homogeneous linewidths seen in the spectral hole burning experiments and relate
the ground state splitting to the decoherence rate.

photon statistics is presented. The method is based on the continuous
maximum-likelihood positive operator-valued measure (ML-POVM) for pure
polarization states over the surface of the Bloch sphere. The success
probability and the mean fidelity are used as the figures of merit to show its
performance. The POVM is found to attain the collective bound of polarization
estimation with respect to the mean fidelity. As demonstrations, explicit
results for the N photon Fock state, the phase-randomized coherent state
(Poisson distribution), and the thermal light are obtained. It is found that
the estimation performances for the Fock state and the Poisson distribution are
almost identical, while that for the thermal light is much worse. This suggests
that thermal light leaks less information to an eavesdropper and hence could
potentially provide more security in polarization-encoded quantum communication
protocols than a single-mode laser beam as customarily considered. Finally,
comparisons against an optimal adaptive measurement with classical
communications are made to show the better and more stable performance of the
continuous ML-POVM.

  system</title><description>  The concept of entropy is fundamental to thermalization, yet appears at odds
with basic principles in quantum mechanics. While statistical mechanics relies
on the maximization of entropy for a system at thermal equilibrium, an isolated
many-body system undergoing Schr\&quot;odinger dynamics has zero entropy because, at
any given time, it is described by a single quantum state. The underlying role
of quantum mechanics in many-body physics is then seemingly antithetical to the
success of statistical mechanics in a large variety of systems. Here we observe
experimentally how this conflict is resolved: we perform microscopy on an
evolving quantum state, and we see thermalization occur on a local scale, while
we measure that the full quantum state remains pure. We directly measure
entanglement entropy and observe how it assumes the role of the thermal entropy
in thermalization. Although the full state has zero entropy, entanglement
creates local entropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local
observables. In combination with number-resolved, single-site imaging, we
demonstrate how our measurements of a pure quantum state agree with the
Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis and thermal ensembles in the presence of a
near-volume law in the entanglement entropy.

As a result, this effective interaction strength can be made large, leading to

instead the propagation of quantum fluctuations and simulates the generation of

conclusions about the distribution of eigenvalues along the real axis. The
previously found picture of the spectral collapse at critical coupling
$g_{\mathrm{c}}$ has to be modified regarding the low lying states, especially
the ground state: We obtain a finite gap between ground state and the continuum

low lying states may be separated from the continuum at $g_{\mathrm{c}}$. We

one or two lattice spacings. This composite quantum walker spreads
ballistically, just as the simple quantum walk. However, because of the
interactions between the internal degrees of freedom, the distribution of its
center-of-mass velocity displays numerous ballistic fronts in the long-time
limit, corresponding to singularities in the empirical velocity distribution.
The spectrum of the centipede and the corresponding group velocities are
analyzed by direct means for the first few values of $N$. Some analytical
results are obtained for arbitrary $N$ by exploiting an exact mapping of the
problem onto a free-fermion system. We thus derive the maximal velocity
describing the ballistic spreading of the two extremal fronts of the centipede
wavefunction, including its non-trivial value in the large-$N$ limit.

  master equations</title><description>  We consider an open quantum system described by a Lindblad-type master
equation with two times-scales. The fast time-scale is strongly dissipative and
drives the system towards a low-dimensional decoherence-free space. To perform
the adiabatic elimination of this fast relaxation, we propose a geometric
asymptotic expansion based on the small positive parameter describing the
time-scale separation. This expansion exploits geometric singular perturbation
theory and center-manifold techniques. We conjecture that, at any order, it
provides an effective slow Lindblad master equation and a completely positive
parameterization of the slow invariant sub-manifold associated to the
low-dimensional decoherence-free space. By preserving complete positivity and
trace, two important structural properties attached to open quantum dynamics,
we obtain a reduced-order model that directly conveys a physical interpretation
since it relies on effective Lindbladian descriptions of the slow evolution. At
the first order, we derive simple formulae for the effective Lindblad master
equation. For a specific type of fast dissipation, we show how any Hamiltonian
perturbation yields Lindbladian second-order corrections to the first-order
slow evolution governed by the Zeno-Hamiltonian. These results are illustrated
on a composite system made of a strongly dissipative harmonic oscillator, the
ancilla, weakly coupled to another quantum system.

  with time-varying modulation frequency</title><description>  We consider the dissipative single-qubit circuit QED architecture in which
the atomic transition frequency undergoes a weak external time-modulation. For
sinusoidal modulation with linearly varying frequency we derive effective
Hamiltonians that resemble the Landau-Zener problem of finite duration
associated to a two- or multi-level systems. The corresponding off-diagonal
coupling coefficients originate either from the rotating or the
counter-rotating terms in the Rabi Hamiltonian, depending on the values of the
modulation frequency. It is demonstrated that in the dissipation less case one
can accomplish almost complete transitions between the eigenstates of the bare
Rabi Hamiltonian even for relatively short duration of the frequency sweep. To
assess the experimental feasibility of our scheme we solved numerically the
phenomenological and the microscopic quantum master equations in the Markovian
regime at zero temperature. Both models exhibit qualitatively similar behavior
and indicate that photon generation from vacuum via effective Landau-Zener
transitions could be implemented with the current technology on the timescales
of a few microseconds. Moreover, unlike the harmonic dynamical Casimir effect
implementations, our proposal does not require the precise knowledge of the
resonant modulation frequency to accomplish meaningful photon generation.

  lattice</title><description>  The concept of flat band plays an important role in strongly-correlated
many-body physics. However, the demonstration of the flat band physics is
highly nontrivial due to intrinsic limitations in conventional condensed matter
materials. Here we propose a circuit quantum electrodynamics simulator of the
2D Lieb lattice exhibiting a flat middle band. By exploiting the simple
parametric conversion method, we design a photonic Lieb lattice with \textit{in

transmissionline resonators. Moreover, the flexibility of our proposal enables
the immediate incorporation of both the artificial gauge field and the strong
photon-photon interaction in a time- and site-resolved manner. To unambiguously
demonstrate the synthesized flat band, we further investigate the observation
of the flat band localization of microwave photons through the pumping and the
steady-state measurements of only few sites on the lattice. Requiring only
current level of technique and being robust against imperfections in realistic
circuits, our scheme can be readily tested in experiments and may pave a new
way towards the future realization of exotic photonic quantum Hall fluids
including anomalous quantum Hall effect and bosonic fractional quantum Hall
states without magnetic fields.

Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). To record this spectrum, we coherently drive
the atomic population between two spin states. A small relative displacement of
the spin-specific trapping potentials enables sideband transitions between
different motional states. The intrinsic non-linearity of the motional
spectrum, mainly originating from two-body interactions, makes it possible to
resolve and address individual excitation lines. Together with sensitive
atom-counting, this constitutes a feasible technique to count single excited
atoms of a BEC and to determine the temperature of nearly pure condensates. As

turns placing pairs of entangled go stones. A phenomenon of quantum-like
collapse occurs when one of the stones in an entangled pair is directly in
contact with at least one other stone. The player to whom the entangled pair
belongs must then remove one of the stones in the pair from the board. The aim
of the game is still to surround more territory than the opponent and as the
number of stones increases, all the entangled pairs of stones eventually reduce
to single stones. Quantum Go provides an interesting and tangible illustration
of quantum concepts such as superposition, entanglement and collapse.

even frozen completely (quantum Zeno effect), the weak non-projective
measurement can effectively compete with standard unitary dynamics leading to
nontrivial effects. Here we consider global weak measurement addressing
collective variables, thus preserving quantum superpositions due to the lack of

idea can be generalized to other multimode quantum systems, including various
quantum emitters, optomechanical arrays, and purely photonic systems with
multiple-path interferometers (photonic circuits). We show that light
scattering from ultracold bosons in optical lattices can be used for defining
macroscopically occupied spatial modes that exhibit long-range coherent

measurement backaction acts on the atomic ensemble quasi-periodically and
induces collective oscillatory dynamics of all the atoms. We introduce an

quantum optics and related disciplines. Systems whose dynamics can be described

beam-spitters, phase-shifters, optical parametric amplifiers, optical

challenges in the field of control theory. Potential applications of such
quantum feedback control systems include quantum computing, quantum error
correction, quantum communications, gravity wave detection, metrology, atom

  A recently emerging approach to the feedback control of quantum linear
systems involves the use of a controller which itself is a quantum linear
system. This approach to quantum feedback control, referred to as coherent
quantum feedback control, has the advantage that it does not destroy quantum
information, is fast, and has the potential for efficient implementation. This
paper discusses recent results concerning the synthesis of H-infinity optimal
controllers for linear quantum systems in the coherent control case. An
important issue which arises both in the modelling of linear quantum systems
and in the synthesis of linear coherent quantum controllers is the issue of
physical realizability. This issue relates to the property of whether a given
set of QSDEs corresponds to a physical quantum system satisfying the laws of
quantum mechanics.

such as the mass and charge of the physical particles, and it is only these
modified properties that can be measured in experiments, not the properties of
the bare particles. The influence of virtual particles is prominent in the
ultrastrong-coupling regime of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which has
recently been realized in several condensed-matter systems. In some of these
systems, the effective interaction between atom-like transitions and the cavity
photons can be switched on or off by external control pulses. This offers
unprecedented possibilities for exploring quantum vacuum fluctuations and the
relation between physical and bare particles. Here we show that, by applying
external electromagnetic pulses of suitable amplitude and frequency, each
virtual photon dressing a physical excitation in cavity-QED systems can be
converted into a physical observable photon, and back again. In this way, the
hidden relationship between the bare and the physical excitations becomes
experimentally testable. The conversion between virtual and physical photons

Monte Carlo (MC) techniques for the models that have been studied so far, due
to the possibility of reaching much smaller lattice spacings. The real reason
for the interest in the TN approach, however, is its ability, shown so far in

particular, we find that for a two-state quantum walks persistence follows an
inverse power-law where the exponent is determined solely by the coin
parameter. Moreover, for a one-parameter family of three-state quantum walks
containing the Grover walk the scaling of persistence is given by two
contributions. The first is the inverse power-law. The second contribution to
the asymptotic behaviour of persistence is an exponential decay coming from the
trapping nature of the studied family of quantum walks. In contrast to the
two-state walks both the exponent of the inverse power-law and the decay

deterministic population passages based on the STAs are insensitive to details
of the operations and can be implemented as fast as the Rabi oscillations, the
fidelity of the generated NOON state could be satisfactorily high. The
feasibility of the proposal is demonstrated specifically with the experimental
circuit QED systems by rapidly driving two artifical qutrits.

  characterized by pure Markov states</title><description>  Any tripartite state which saturates the strong subadditivity relation for
the quantum entropy is defined as the Markov state.A tripartite pure state
describing an open system, its environment and their purifying system isa pure
Markov state iff the bipartite marginal state of purifying system and
environment is a product state. It has been shown that as long as the
purification of the input system-environment state is a pure Markov state the
reduced dynamics of the open system can be described, on the support of initial
system state, by a quantum channel for every joint unitary evolution of the
system-environment composite even in the presence of initial correlations.
Entanglement, discord and classical correlations of the initial
system-environment states implied by the pure Markov state are analyzed and it
has been shown that all these correlations are entirely specified by the
entropy of the environment. Some implications concerning perfect quantum error
correction procedure and quantum Markovian dynamics are presented.

  network</title><description>  We report the dissemination of an ultrastable optical frequency signal to two
distant users simultaneously using a branching network. The ultrastable signal
is extracted along a main fibre link; it is optically tracked with a
narrow-linewidth laser diode, which light is injected in a secondary link. The
propagation noise of both links is actively compensated. We implement this
scheme with two links of 50-km fibre spools, the extraction being setup at the
mid-point of the main link. We show that the extracted signal at the end of the
secondary link exhibits fractional frequency instability of 1.4x10-15 at 1-s
measurement time, almost equal to the 1.3x10-15 instability of the main link
output end. The long-term instabilities are also very similar, at a level of
3-5x10-20 at 3x104-s integration time. We also show that the setting up of this
extraction device, or a simpler one, at the main link input, can test the
proper functioning of the noise rejection on this main link. This work is a
significant step towards a robust and flexible ultra-stable network for
multi-users dissemination.

computation. However, its performance is limited by the adiabatic theorem of
quantum mechanics. In this scenario, shortcuts to adiabaticity, such as
provided by the superadiabatic theory, constitute a valuable tool to speed up
the adiabatic quantum behavior. In this dissertation we introduce two different
models to perform universal superadiabatic quantum computing, which are based
on the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity by counter-diabatic Hamiltonians. The
first model is based on the use of superadiabatic quantum teleportation,
introduced in this dissertation, as a primitive to quantum computing. Thus, we
provide the counter-diabatic driving for arbitrary $n$-qubit gates. In
addition, our approach maps the counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an arbitrary
$n$-qubit {\it gate} teleportation into the implementation of a rotated
counter-diabatic Hamiltonian for an $n$-qubit {\it state} teleportation. In the
second model we use the concept of controlled superadiabatic evolutions to show
how we can implement arbitrary $n$-controlled quantum gates. Remarkably, this
task can be performed by simple time-independent counter-diabatic Hamiltonians.
These two models can be used to design different sets of universal quantum
gates. We show that the use of the quantum speed limit suggests that the
superadiabatic time evolution is compatible with arbitrarily small time
intervals, where this arbitrariness is constrained to the energetic cost
necessary to perform the superadiabatic evolution.

admits a local hidden state model augmented with $c$ bits of classical
communication from an untrusted party (Alice) to a trusted party (Bob). In case
of one bit of information ($c=1$), we show that this set has a nontrivial
intersection with the sets admitting a local hidden state and a local hidden

infinite amount of classical communication is required from an untrusted Alice

two-qubit maximally entangled state. It is conjectured that a state-of-the-art
quantum experiment would be able to falsify two bits of communication this way.

linearly polarized probe field in a weakly birefringent atomic system in tripod

an atomic vapor cell facilitates a large angular divergence between circular
components. We show that the angular resolution can be dynamically controlled
by optimally choosing the angle of incidence and the transverse profile of the
control beam. For instance, by employing a Laguerre-Gaussian profile of the
control field, one can impart a large angular divergence to the circular
components close to the entry face of the atomic vapor cell. We further
demonstrate how such a medium causes the focusing and refocusing of the probe

absorption in the medium remains negligible at resonance as a cumulative effect
of coherent population oscillations (CPO) and electromagnetically induced

quantum dot (DQD) system and analyse its dynamics under a time-dependent linear
detuning, using GPU accelerated numerical solutions to the time-dependent
Schr\&quot;odinger equation. The optimal qubit is found to have basis states defined
as the symmetric and antisymmetric linear combinations of the lowest energy
bonding and anti-bonding states of the DQD at zero bias. In contrast to charge
qubits defined by the two localised ground states of the uncoupled DQD, this
choice of the basis causes the resulting dynamics to have a maximal overlap
with an idealised two-state model. Our optimal qubit basis states are not
localised to a single quantum dot and, as such, initialising the qubit requires
a particular sequence of gate pulses to take the system from an initial
fiducial state of the DQD to the logical $0$ or $1$. We determine this sequence
using pulses that incorporate the expected experimental finite rise times. We
also show how to perform arbitrary single qubit operations on the Bloch sphere
using spin-echo type pulsing, allowing us to obtain any qubit state with at
most two single pulses. Measurement of the optimal qubits is achieved by
determining the probability of finding the electron in one of the dots.

optical transistor in a system composed by a single atom trapped inside a high
finesse cavity. In order to store and map the quantum state of an input pulse
onto internal states of the single atom (quantum memory) we employ the
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) phenomenon (which can work out
as an optical transistor) where the information can be transferred to the dark
state of the atom modelled by a three-level system in a {\Lambda}-type
configuration. In our model we consider a suitable temporal shape for the
control field that ensures the adiabaticity of the storage process and
retrieval of the probe pulse. The dynamic of the field inside the cavity was
obtained by master equation approach, while the outside field was calculated by
input-output formalism. We have analysed two different setups: i) two-sided and
ii) single-sided cavities. While the first setup is the most appropriate and
commonly used to observe cavity-EIT in the transmission spectrum, thus the best
configuration for the optical transistor, the maximum quantum memory efficiency
can not reach reasonable values, being limited to 50% for symmetric cavities.
On the other hand, with single-sided cavity the quantum memory efficiency
increases considerably and can reach values close to 100% in the strong
atom-field coupling regime. However this specific setup is not favourable to
observe the cavity-EIT effect in the transmission spectrum and then it is not
appropriate to control the transmission of light pulses.

quantum chaos in systems that do not have a direct classical counterpart. It is
based on numerical investigations of asymmetric Heisenberg spin ladders with
varied interaction strengths between the legs, i.e., along the rungs. The
relaxation of the energy difference between the legs is investigated. Two
different parameters, both intended to quantify the degree of accordance with
the ETH, are computed. Both indicate violation of the ETH at large interaction
strengths but at different thresholds. Indeed the energy difference is found
not to relax independently of its initial value above some critical interaction
strength which coincides with one of the thresholds. At the same point the

  Decoherence Impedance, Anti-Unruh and Information Backflow</title><description>  In this paper, we consider the decoherence patterns of a topological qubit
made of two Majorana zero modes in the generic linear and circular motions in
the Minkowski spacetime. We show that the reduced dynamics is exact without
Markov approximation. Our results imply that the acceleration will cause
thermalization as expected by Unruh effect. However, for the short-time scale,
we find the rate of decoherence is anti-correlated with the acceleration, as
kind of decoherence impedance. This is in fact related to the &quot;anti-Unruh&quot;
phenomenon previously found by studying the transition probability of
Unruh-DeWitt detector. We also obtain the information backflow by some time
modulations of coupling constant or acceleration, which is a characteristic of
the underlying non-Markovian reduced dynamics. Moreover, by exploiting the
nonlocal nature of the topological qubit, we find that some incoherent
accelerations of the constituent Majorana zero modes can preserve the coherence
instead of thermalizing it.

  excitonic properties and line broadening mechanisms</title><description>  We study the excitonic coupling and homogeneous spectral line width of brick
layer J-aggregate films. We begin by analysing the structural information
revealed by the two-exciton states probed in two-dimensional spectra. Our first
main result is that the relation between the excitonic couplings and the
spectral shift in a two-dimensional structure is different (larger shift for
the same nearest neighbour coupling) from that in a one-dimensional structure,
which leads to an estimation of dipolar coupling in two-dimensional lattices.
We next investigate the mechanisms of homogeneous broadening - population
relaxation and pure dephasing - and evaluate their relative importance in
linear and two-dimensional aggregates. Our second main result is that pure
dephasing dominates the line width in two-dimensional systems up to a crossover
temperature, which explains the linear temperature dependence of the
homogeneous line width. This is directly related to the decreased density of
states at the band edge when compared with linear aggregates, thus reducing the
contribution of population relaxation to dephasing. Pump-probe experiments are
suggested to directly measure the lifetime of the bright state and can
therefore support the proposed model.

finesse resonators, which can induce the formation of ordered spatial patterns.
When a transverse laser drives the atoms, the system undergoes a second order
phase transition, that separates a uniform spatial density from a Bragg grating
maximizing scattering into the cavity and is controlled by the laser intensity.
Starting from a Fokker-Planck equation describing the semiclassical dynamics of
the $N$-atom distribution function, we systematically develop a mean-field
model and analyse its predictions for the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium
dynamics. The validity of the mean-field model is tested by comparison with the
numerical simulations of the $N$-body Fokker-Planck equation and by means of a
BBGKY hierarchy. The mean-field theory predictions well reproduce several
results of the $N$-body Fokker-Planck equation for sufficiently short times,
and are in good agreement with existing theoretical approaches based on
field-theoretical models. Mean-field, on the other hand, predicts
thermalization time scales which are at least one order of magnitude shorter
than the ones predicted by the $N$-body dynamics. We attribute this discrepancy
to the fact that the mean-field ansatz discards the effects of the long-range
incoherent forces due to cavity losses.

and high-order spatial modes promises high-capacity communication channel.
While high-order spatial modes have been widely exploited for dense coding and
high-dimensional quantum information processing, the properties of polarization
preservation of high-order spatial beams propagating in turbulent atmosphere
have not been comprehensively investigated yet. Here we focus on the properties
of polarization preservation of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams
propagating along different atmospheric turbulence paths. The analytical
expressions for the polarization of partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beams
propagating through atmospheric turbulence along different paths have been
derived. It is shown that the larger the coherence length is, and the larger
the beam order m, n are, the less the polarization is changed. We find that the
evolution properties of the polarization in slant-down paths through turbulent
atmosphere are similar to the case in free space if the condition zenith angle
{\xi}&lt;{\pi}/4 is satisfied. While at a long propagation distance, evolution
properties of polarization in horizontal paths of turbulent atmosphere differs
much from that in free space and in slant paths. The results may allow one to
choose the optimal propagation path in terms of specific applications, which is
helpful for future experimental implementation of multiple-degrees-of-freedom
free-space communication.

Unfortunately, the known formulation of the teleportation-stretching expansion

mirror through optical rigidity. We experimentally demonstrate the technique
with a 5-mg suspended mirror, which is a part of a triangular optical cavity.
The observed enhancement of the pendulum's resonant frequency is from 2.14 Hz
to 1.06 kHz, and the lowest temperature achieved is 15 mK. Using this technique
we demonstrate reduction of the thermal decoherence rate, i.e. the inverse time
of the absorption of a phonon from the thermal environment, of 60-fold from its
bare value.

good/correct theoretical/mathematical model of any physical concept, and our
physical space should not be an exception. The best picture of the physical
space, in Newtonian physics, is given by the configuration space of a free
particle. The space, as well as the phase space, can be constructed as a
representation space of the relativity symmetry. Starting with the
corresponding quantum symmetry, we illustrate the construction of a quantum

of the classical picture as an approximation through the contraction of the
(relativity) symmetry and the representations of it. The result suggests a
picture of the physical space beyond that of a finite dimensional manifold.

quantum system subject to Hamiltonian evolution as well as unmonitored and
monitored decoherence channels. The latter imply a stochastic evolution of the
quantum state (density operator), whose associated probability distribution we
characterize. We show that for two sets of typical experimental settings,
corresponding either to weak quantum non demolition measurements or to weak
fluorescence measurements, the three Bloch coordinates of a two-level quantum
system (qubit) remain in fact confined to a deterministically evolving surface
or curve inside the Bloch sphere. We explicitly solve the deterministic
evolution, and we provide a closed-form expression for the probability
distribution on this surface or curve. Finally, we relate the existence in
general of such deterministically evolving submanifolds to an accessibility
question of control theory, which can be answered with an explicit algebraic

  Computing</title><description>  Continuous-time quantum walks and adiabatic quantum evolution are two general
techniques for quantum computing, both of which are described by Hamiltonians
that govern their evolutions by Schr\&quot;odinger's equation. In the former, the
Hamiltonian is fixed, while in the latter, the Hamiltonian varies with time. As
a result, their formulations of Grover's algorithm evolve differently through
Hilbert space. We show that this difference is fundamental; they cannot be made
to evolve along each other's path without introducing structure more powerful
than the standard oracle for unstructured search. For an adiabatic quantum
evolution to evolve like the quantum walk search algorithm, it must interpolate
between three fixed Hamiltonians, one of which is complex and introduces
structure that is stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Conversely,
for a quantum walk to evolve along the path of the adiabatic search algorithm,
it must be a chiral quantum walk on a weighted, directed star graph with
structure that is also stronger than the oracle for unstructured search. Thus
the two techniques, although similar in being described by Hamiltonians that
govern their evolution, compute by fundamentally irreconcilable means.

foundation of the time concept in cosmology. It is standard to point to the
Planck scale (located at $\sim 10^{-43}$ seconds after a fictitious &quot;Big Bang&quot;
point) as a limit for how far back we may extrapolate the standard cosmological
model. In our work we have suggested that there are several other (physically
motivated) interesting limits -- located at least thirty orders of magnitude
before the Planck time -- where the physical basis of the cosmological model
and its time concept is progressively weakened. Some of these limits are
connected to phase transitions in the early universe which gradually undermine
the notion of 'standard clocks' widely employed in cosmology. Such
considerations lead to a 'scale problem' for time which becomes particularly
acute above the electroweak phase transition (before $\sim 10^{-11}$ seconds).
Other limits are due to problems of building up a cosmological reference frame,
or even contemplating a sensible notion of proper time, if the early universe
constituents become too quantum. This 'quantum problem' for time arises e.g. if
a pure quantum phase is contemplated at the beginning of inflation at, say,
$\sim 10^{-34}$ seconds.

counterintuitvely, from the perspective of decoherence in this framework, the
particle experiences a vacuum bath with a temperature-modified interaction
strength, rather than a thermal bath. We investigate how this &quot;relativistic

in intense laser fields. The time-dependent surface flux (t-SURFF) method for
the calculation of PES [L. Tao, A. Scrinzi, New Journal of Physics 14, 013021
(2012)] allows to keep the numerical grid much smaller than the space over
which the wavefunction would be spread at the end of the laser pulse. We
present an implementation of the t-SURFF method in the well established
TDSE-solver Qprop [D. Bauer, P. Koval, Comput. Phys. Commun. 174, 396 (2006)].
Qprop efficiently propagates wavefunctions for single-active electron systems
with spherically symmetric binding potentials in classical, linearly (along
$z$) or elliptically (in the $xy$-plane) polarized laser fields in dipole

Because there is no net Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in the time-dependent case on
the commutative space, therefore, a tiny deviation from zero indicates new
physics. Based on the Seiberg-Witten map we obtain the gauge invariant and
Lorentz covariant Aharonov-Bohm phase shift in general case on noncommutative
space. We find there are two kinds of contribution: momentum-dependent and
momentum-independent corrections. For the momentum-dependent correction, there
is a cancellation between the magnetic and electric phase shifts, just like the
case on the commutative space. However, there is a non-trivial contribution in
the momentum-independent correction. This is true for both the time-independent
and time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effects on the noncommutative space. However,
for the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect, there is no overwhelming
background which exists in the time-independent Aharonov-Bohm effect on both
commutative and noncommutative space. Therefore, the time-dependent
Aharonov-Bohm can be sensitive to the spatial noncommutativity. \draftnote{The
net correction is proportional to the product of the magnetic fluxes through
the fundamental area represented by the noncommutative parameter $\theta$, and
through the surface enclosed by the trajectory of charged particle.} More
interestingly, there is an anti-collinear relation between the logarithms of
the magnetic field $B$ and the averaged flux $\Phi/N$ (N is the number of
fringes shifted). This nontrivial relation can also provide a way to test the
spatial noncommutativity. For $B\Phi/N\sim 1$, our estimation on the
experimental sensitivity shows that it can reach the $\rm 10GeV$ scale. This
sensitivity can be enhanced by using stronger magnetic field strength, larger

allows the standard Heisenberg uncertainty relation to be derived from a
classical uncertainty relation for complex random variables. We show this
formula also leads to strong uncertainty relations for unitary operators, and
underlies an interpretation of weak values as optimal (complex) estimates of

that are weakly and strongly measured in a weak measurement context obey a

Moreover, general tradeoff relations between weak purity, quantum purity and

nitrogen-vacancy center (NV center) locating at the end of the oscillator. A
second order magnetic gradient is applied and inducing coupling between
mechanical modes and the NV center. By applying proper external magnetic field,
the energy difference between NV center electron spin levels can be tuned to
match the energy difference between two mechanical modes $a$ and $b$. A laser
is used for continuously initializing the NV center electron spin. The mode $a$
with lower frequency is driven by a thermal bath. We find that the temperature
of the mode $b$ is significantly cooled when the heating bath temperature is
increased. We discuss the conditions that quantum regime cooling requires, and
confirm the results by numerical simulation. Finally we give the intuitive
physical explanation on this unusual effect.

  walks with gain and loss</title><description>  $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, that is, a combined parity and time-reversal
symmetry is a key milestone for non-Hermite systems exhibiting entirely real
eigenenergy. In the present work, motivated by a recent experiment, we study
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the time-evolution operator of non-unitary quantum
walks. We present the explicit definition of $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry by
employing a concept of symmetry time frames. We provide a necessary and
sufficient condition so that the time-evolution operator of the non-unitary
quantum walk retains $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry even when parameters of the model
depend on position. It is also shown that there exist extra symmetries embedded
in the time-evolution operator. Applying these results, we clarify that the
non-unitary quantum walk in the experiment does have $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry.

classical-quantum wiretap channel subject to the constraint that the
eavesdropper on the channel should not be able to learn whether the legitimate
parties are using the channel to communicate or not. Specifically, the relative
entropy between the output quantum states at the eavesdropper when a codeword

Extending earlier works, this paper proves the &quot;square-root law&quot; for a broad

be reliably and covertly transmitted over $n$ uses of such a channel scales
like $\sqrt{n}$. The scaling constant is also determined.

represent a pseudo-spin for atoms trapped within a photonic crystal waveguide

PCW, virtual photons mediate coherent spin-spin interactions between lattice

of distance across the PCW. In conjunction with auxiliary pump fields,
spin-exchange versus atom-atom separation can be engineered with arbitrary

and we must therefore look beyond classical information theory to determine
their communication capacity as well as to find efficient encoding and decoding
schemes of the highest rates. Thermal channels, which arise from linear
coupling of the field to a thermal environment, are of particular practical
relevance; their classical capacity has been recently established, but their
quantum capacity remains unknown. While the capacity sets the ultimate limit on
reliable communication rates, it does not promise that such rates are
achievable by practical means. Here we construct efficiently-encodable codes
for thermal channels which achieve the classical capacity and the so-called
Gaussian coherent information for transmission of classical and quantum

particle as a working medium generally increases the output power at the
expense of inducing friction that lowers the cycle efficiency. We propose to
scale up a quantum heat engine utilizing a many-particle working medium in
combination with the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity to boost the nonadiabatic
performance by eliminating quantum friction and reducing the cycle time. To
this end, we first analyze the finite-time thermodynamics of a quantum Otto
cycle implemented with a quantum fluid confined in a time-dependent harmonic
trap. We show that nonadiabatic effects can be controlled and tailored to match
the adiabatic performance using a variety of shortcuts to adiabaticity. As a
result, the nonadiabatic dynamics of the scaled-up many-particle quantum heat
engine exhibits no friction and the cycle can be run at maximum efficiency with
a tunable output power. We demonstrate our results with a working medium
consisting of particles with inverse-square pairwise interactions, that
includes noninteracting and hard-core bosons as limiting cases.

(PEPS) are generally hard to contract. This is arguably the main reason why
variational tensor network methods in 2D are still not as successful as in 1D.
However, this is not necessarily the case if the tensor network represents a
gapped ground state of a local Hamiltonian; such states are subject to many
constraints and contain much more structure. In this paper we introduce a new
approach for approximating the expectation value of a local observable in
ground states of local Hamiltonians that are represented as PEPS
tensor-networks. Instead of contracting the full tensor-network, we try to
estimate the expectation value using only a local patch of the tensor-network
around the observable. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that this is often easier
to do when the system is frustrated. In such case, the spanning vectors of the
local patch are subject to non-trivial constraints that can be utilized via a
semi-definite program to calculate rigorous lower- and upper-bounds on the
expectation value. We test our approach in 1D systems, where we show how the
expectation value can be calculated up to at least 3 or 4 digits of precision,
even when the patch radius is smaller than the correlation length.

no on-line control and no external fitting are needed. The engine can employ

  of resonators</title><description>  In a circuit consisting of two or more resonators, the inter-cavity crosstalk
is inevitable, which could create some problems, such as degrading the
performance of quantum operations and the fidelity of various quantum states.
The focus of this work is to propose a crosstalk-insensitive method for
simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators, which is important in
large-scale quantum information processing and communication in a network
consisting of resonators or cavities. In this work, we consider 2N resonators
of different frequencies, which are coupled to a three-level quantum system
(qutrit). By applying a strong pulse to the coupler qutrit, we show that an
effective Hamiltonian can be constructed for simultaneously coupling multiple
pairs of resonators.~The main advantage of this proposal is that the effect of
inter-resonator crosstalks is greatly suppressed by using resonators of
different frequencies. In addition, by employing the qutrit-resonator
dispersive interaction, the intermediate higher-energy level of the qutrit is
virtually excited and thus decoherence from this level is suppressed. This
effective Hamiltonian can be applied to implement quantum operations with
photonic qubits distributed in different resonators. As one application of this
Hamiltonian, we show how to simultaneously generate multiple EPR pairs of
photonic qubits distributed in 2N resonators. Numerical simulations show that
it is feasible to prepare two high-fidelity EPR photonic pairs using a setup of
four one-dimensional transmission line resonators coupled to a superconducting
flux qutrit with current circuit QED technology.

representation of quantum superpositions which goes beyond the mere reference
to mathematical structures and measurement outcomes. This proposal goes in the
opposite direction of the orthodox project which attempts to &quot;bridge the gap&quot;
between the quantum formalism and common sense &quot;classical reality&quot;
--precluding, right from the start, the possibility of interpreting quantum
superpositions through non-classical notions. We will argue that in order to
restate the problem of interpretation of quantum mechanics in truly ontological
terms we require a radical revision of the problems and definitions addressed
within the orthodox literature. On the one hand, we will discuss the need of
providing a formal redefinition of superpositions which captures their
contextual character. On the other hand, we attempt to replace the focus on the
measurement problem, which concentrates on the justification of measurement
outcomes from &quot;weird&quot; superposed states, and introduce the superposition
problem which concentrates instead on the conceptual representation of
superpositions themselves. In this respect, after presenting three necessary
conditions for objective physical representation, we will provide arguments
which show why the classical (actualist) representation of physics faces severe
difficulties to solve the superposition problem. Finally, we will also argue
that, if we are willing to abandon the (metaphysical) presupposition according
to which 'Actuality = Reality', then there is plenty of room to construct a
conceptual representation for quantum superpositions.

particularly identified in the strong-coupling regime where the open system and
its environment are strongly interacted with evident non-Markovianity being
revealed. The new method provides acceptable approximation compared with
traditional perturbation methods for generically structured reservoirs and
indicates correct oscillatory and decay behaviors, helping us to recognize
non-Markovianity in a perturbative way.

  Only a Variable Beam Splitter and Single-Photon Detector, In Principle</title><description>  It is generally assumed that on-off detectors with single-photon sensitivity
cannot distinguish coherent states from phase-mixed coherent states without
some form of quadrature-based tomography. Here, we show that it is
theoretically possible to distinguish these states without quadrature-based
methods by comparing the vacuum probability of one output port of a variable
beam splitter (VBS) that has two different phase-mixed coherent states as its
inputs to the well-known case of dual coherent-state inputs. As an application,
a method is proposed to test whether a laser field is in a coherent state over
a given time by simply measuring the VBS output populations with an on-off
single-photon detector. Unfortunately, timing limitations of present technology
prohibit such simple tests, but the technique may become practical in the
future.

  Considerations</title><description>  This dissertation reports our investigation into the existence of anyons,
which interpolate between bosons and fermions, in light of the Symmetrization
Postulate, which states that only the two extremes exist. The Symmetrization
Postulate can be understood as asserting that there are only two consistent
ways of combining the behavior of distinguishable particles to obtain the
behavior of identical ones. We showed that anyonic behavior then arises because
of the way in which the probability amplitudes of distinguishable particles in
two dimensions are affected by the topology of the space. These can then be
combined in one of the ways arising from the Symmetrization Postulate, to form
identical anyons. Therefore, anyons do not invalidate the Symmetrization
Postulate, but are entirely compatible with it. In order to show that anyons
can arise without particle identity, we investigated how distinguishable
particles can gain particular properties from the topology of their
configuration space. We managed to do so, and in the process, discovered a
novel approach for quantizing multiply-connected spaces, in a way that is more
suited to anyons than the standard approach.

the measurement processes. In this paper, we point out that many of these
difficulties originate from the different roles of measurement outcomes and
observable quantities, which cannot simply be identified with each other. Our
analysis shows that the Hilbert space formalism itself describes a fundamental
separation between quantitative properties and qualitative outcomes that needs
to be taken into account in an objective description of quantum measurements.
We derive fundamental relations between the statistics of measurement outcomes
and the values of physical quantities that explain how the objective properties
of a quantum system appear in the context of different measurement
interactions. Our results indicate that non-classical correlations can be
understood in terms of the actual role of physical properties as quantifiable
causes of the external effects observed in a quantum measurement.

the discoveries of Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and the solution of Simon's problem.
In this article, we prove the optimal exact quantum query complexity for a

Boolean functions in terms of exact quantum query complexity. More
specifically, (1) we give an optimal exact quantum query algorithm with

symmetrically partial Boolean function $f$ has exact quantum 1-query complexity
if and only if $f$ can be computed by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. (3) We also

this paradigm cannot be considered thermodynamically consistent as it does not
account for the thermodynamic cost of these measurements. To remedy this
conceptual inconsistency we introduce a novel paradigm that relies only on the
expected change of the average energy given the initial energy eigenbasis. In
particular, we completely omit quantum measurements in the definition of

We divide the environment in arbitrary two partitions and the entanglement

the charge and spin dynamics in nanostructures by means of ultrashort,
broadband electromagnetic pulses. A particular focus is put on so-called
half-cycle and single-cycle pulses that offer efficient schemes for coherent
control. The discussion is mostly limited to cases where the pulse duration is
shorter than the characteristic time scales of the unperturbed system. We
summarize the current knowledge presenting a consistent theoretical approach
for describing the action of such pulses on charge carriers in nanostructures.
In essence, the action amounts to a quantum map between the system quantum
states at an appropriately chosen time moment during the pulse. The influence
of a particular pulse shape on the post-pulse dynamics is reduced to several
integral parameters entering the expression for the quantum map. The
implications of the theory for acting on the system with a periodic pulse
sequence are described. Steering the system to a target quantum state, we work
out and discuss conditions for the sustainability of this coherent state.
Associated physical quantities characterizing the quasistationarity of a
periodically evolving quantum dynamics are introduced and analyzed. This
approach is used to control charge, spin, and valley degrees of freedom in
nanostructures on picosecond and subpicosecond time scales. An overview is
given over several applications in one-dimensional semiconductor quantum wires
and superlattices, double quantum dots, semiconductor and graphene quantum

between non-interacting particles. Despite this, demonstrations of large-scale
photonic networks involving more than two independent sources of quantum light

  photonic-crystal slabs</title><description>  Light scattering by a two-dimensional photonic crystal slab (PCS) can result
in dramatic interference effects associated with Fano resonances. Such devices
offer appealing alternatives to distributed Bragg reflectors or filters for
various applications such as optical wavelength and polarization filters,
reflectors, semiconductor lasers, photodetectors, bio-sensors, or non-linear
optical components. Suspended PCSs also find natural applications in the field
of optomechanics, where the mechanical modes of a suspended slab interact via
radiation pressure with the optical field of a high finesse cavity. The
reflectivity and transmission properties of a defect-free suspended PCS around
normal incidence can be used to couple out-of-plane mechanical modes to an
optical field by integrating it in a free space cavity. Here, we demonstrate
the successful implementation of a PCS reflector on a high-tensile stress
Si$_3$N$_4$ nanomembrane. We illustrate the physical process underlying the
high reflectivity by measuring the photonic crystal band diagram. Moreover, we
introduce a clear theoretical description of the membrane scattering properties
in the presence of optical losses. By embedding the PCS inside a high-finesse
cavity, we fully characterize its optical properties. The spectrally, angular,
and polarization resolved measurements demonstrate the wide tunability of the
membrane's reflectivity, from nearly 0 to 99.9470~$\pm$ 0.0025 \%, and show
that material absorption is not the main source of optical loss. Moreover, the
cavity storage time demonstrated in this work exceeds the mechanical period of
low-order mechanical drum modes. This so-called resolved sideband condition is
a prerequisite to achieve quantum control of the mechanical resonator with
light.

  factor</title><description>  Three-dimensional (3D) superconducting microwave cavities with large mode
volumes typically have high quality factors ($&gt;10^6$). This is due to a reduced
sensitivity to surface dielectric losses, which is the limiting source of
dissipation in two-dimensional transmission line resonators. In recent years,
3D microwave cavities have been extensively used for coupling and interacting
with superconducting quantum bits (qubits), providing a versatile platform for
quantum information processing and hybrid quantum systems. A current issue that
has arisen is that 3D superconducting cavities do not permit magnetic field
control of qubits embedded in these cavities. In contrast, microwave cavities
made of normal metals can be transparent to magnetic fields, but experience a
much lower quality factor ($\sim 10^4$), which negates many of the advantages
of the 3D architecture. In an attempt to create a device that bridges a gap
between these two types of cavities, having magnetic field control and high
quality factor, we have created a hybrid 3D cavity. This new cavity is
primarily composed of aluminium but also contains a small copper insert. We
measured the internal quality factor of the hybrid cavity to be $102000$, which
is an order of magnitude improvement over all previously tested copper
cavities. An added benefit to that our hybrid cavity possesses is that it also
provides an improved thermal link to the sample that superconducting cavities
alone cannot provide. In order to demonstrate precise magnetic control within
the cavity, we performed spectroscopy of three superconducting qubits placed in
the cavity, where individual control of each qubit's frequency was exerted with
small wire coils attached to the cavity. A large improvement in quality factor
and magnetic field control makes this 3D hybrid cavity an attractive new
platform for circuit quantum electrodynamics experiments.

unitary transformation on the combined spatial and internal degrees of freedom
of light. This procedure effects an arbitrary $n_{s}n_{p}\times n_{s}n_{p}$
unitary matrix on the state of light in $n_{s}$ spatial and $n_{p}$ internal
modes.
  I devise an accurate and precise procedure for characterizing any multi-port
linear optical interferometer using one- and two-photon interference. Accuracy
is achieved by estimating and correcting systematic errors that arise due to
spatiotemporal and polarization mode mismatch. Enhanced accuracy and precision
are attained by fitting experimental coincidence data to a curve simulated
using measured source spectra. The efficacy of our characterization procedure
is verified by numerical simulations.
  I develop group-theoretic methods for the analysis and simulation of linear
interferometers. I devise a graph-theoretic algorithm to construct the boson
realizations of the canonical SU$(n)$ basis states, which reduce the canonical
subgroup chain, for arbitrary $n$. The boson realizations are employed to
construct $\mathcal{D}$-functions, which are the matrix elements of arbitrary
irreducible representations, of SU$(n)$ in the canonical basis. I show that
immanants of principal submatrices of a unitary matrix $T$ are a sum of the
diagonal $\mathcal{D}(\Omega)$-functions of group element $\Omega$ over $t$
determined by the choice of submatrix and over the irrep $(\lambda)$ determined
by the immanant under consideration. The algorithm for $\mathrm{SU}(n)$
$\mathcal{D}$-function computation and the results connecting these functions
with immanants open the possibility of group-theoretic analysis and simulation

spin echoes. It can be implemented in Dirac-like systems, such as (real or

main goals of quantum information theory. A prominent example for such a
scenario is the task of quantum state merging where two parties aim to merge
their parts of a tripartite quantum state. In standard quantum state merging,
entanglement is considered as an expensive resource, while local quantum
operations can be performed at no additional cost. However, recent developments
show that some local operations could be more expensive than others: it is
reasonable to distinguish between local incoherent operations and local
operations which can create coherence. This idea leads us to the task of
incoherent quantum state merging, where one of the parties has free access to
local incoherent operations only. In this case the resources of the process are
quantified by pairs of entanglement and coherence. Here, we develop tools for
studying this process, and apply them to several relevant scenarios. While
quantum state merging can lead to a gain of entanglement, our results imply
that no merging procedure can gain entanglement and coherence at the same time.
We also provide a general lower bound on the entanglement-coherence sum, and
show that the bound is tight for all pure states. Our results also lead to an
incoherent version of Schumacher compression: in this case the compression rate
is equal to the von Neumann entropy of the diagonal elements of the
corresponding quantum state.

photon blockades, in which a single phonon in an anharmonic mechanical
resonator can impede the excitation of a second phonon. We propose an
experimental method to realize phonon blockade in a driven harmonic
nanomechanical resonator coupled to a qubit, where the coupling is proportional
to the second-order nonlinear susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}$. This is in contrast
to the standard realizations of phonon and photon blockade effects in Kerr-type
$\chi^{(3)}$ nonlinear systems. The nonlinear coupling strength can be adjusted
conveniently by changing the coherent drive field.As an example, we apply this
model to predict and describe phonon blockade in a nanomechanical resonator
coupled to a Cooper-pair box (i.e., a charge qubit) with a linear longitudinal
coupling. By obtaining the solutions of the steady state for this composite
system, we give the conditions forobserving strong antibunching and
sub-Poissonian phonon-number statistics in this induced second-order nonlinear
system. Besides using the qubit to produce phonon blockade states, the qubit
itself can also be employed to detect blockade effects by measuring its states.
Numerical simulations indicate that the robustness of the phonon blockade, and
the sensitivity of detecting it, will benefit from this strong induced
nonlinear coupling.

We consider QWs on Cayley graphs of some group $G$. In the literature,
investigations concerning infinite $G$ have been focused on graphs
corresponding to $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$ with coin system of dimension 2, whereas for
one-dimensional coin (so called scalar QWs) only the case of finite $G$ has
been studied. Here we prove that the evolution of a scalar QW with $G$ infinite
Abelian is trivial, providing a thorough classification of this kind of walks.
Then we consider the infinite dihedral group $D_\infty$, that is the unique
non-Abelian group $G$ containing a subgroup $H\cong\mathbb{Z}$ with two cosets.
We characterize the class of QWs on the Cayley graphs of $D_\infty$ and, via a

spinorial walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ which satisfies parity symmetry. This class of
QWs includes the Weyl and the Dirac QWs. Remarkably, there exist also spinorial

  interferometer</title><description>  The Sagnac speed meter interferometer topology can potentially provide
enhanced sensitivity to gravitational waves in the audio-band compared to
equivalent Michelson interferometers. A challenge with the Sagnac speed meter
interferometer arises from the intrinsic lack of sensitivity at low frequencies
where the velocity-proportional signal is smaller than the noise associated
with the sensing of the signal. Using as an example the on-going
proof-of-concept Sagnac speed meter experiment in Glasgow, we quantify the
problem and present a solution involving the extraction of a small
displacement-proportional signal. This displacement signal can be combined with
the existing velocity signal to enhance low frequency sensitivity, and we
derive optimal filters to accomplish this for different signal strengths. We
show that the extraction of the displacement signal for low frequency control
purposes can be performed without reducing significantly the quantum
non-demolition character of this type of interferometer.

performed on QA simulators and early-stage commercial QA hardware and compared
to an unprecedented number of traditional ML techniques. We extend QBoost, an

We further explore the performance of RQBoost in the space of NLP and seizure

quantum circuit consisting of only one- and two- q-bit gates that would
transfer one state into another. We call it the quantum maze problem for the
reasons described in the paper. We argue that in a large N limit the quantum
maze problem is equivalent to the problem of finding a semiclassical trajectory
of some lattice field theory (the dual theory) on an N+1 dimensional space-time
with geometrically flat, but topologically compact spatial slices. The spatial
fundamental domain is an N dimensional hyper-rhombohedron, and the temporal
direction describes transitions from an arbitrary initial state to an arbitrary
target state. We first consider a complex Klein-Gordon field theory and argue
that it can only be used to study the shortest quantum circuits which do not
involve generators composed of tensor products of multiple Pauli Z matrices.
Since such situation is not generic we call it the Z-problem. On the dual field
theory side the Z-problem corresponds to massless excitations of the phase
(Goldstone modes) that we attempt to fix using Higgs mechanism. The simplest
dual theory which does not suffer from the massless excitation (or from the
Z-problem) is the Abelian-Higgs model which we argue can be used for finding
the shortest quantum circuits. Since every trajectory of the field theory is
mapped directly to a quantum circuit, the shortest quantum circuits are
identified with semiclassical trajectories. We also discuss the complexity of
an actual algorithm that uses a dual theory prospective for solving the quantum
maze problem and compare it with a geometric approach. We argue that it might
be possible to solve the problem in sub-exponential time in 2^N, but for that
we must consider the Klein-Gordon theory on curved spatial geometry and/or more
complicated (than N-torus) topology.

In the proposed approach, starting from a mixture of cold trapped Ca$^+$ ions

photoassociated in the excited E$^{1}\Sigma^+$ electronic state and allowed to
spontaneously decay either to the ground electronic state or an intermediate

elementary particles. The theorem goes beyond Bell's theorem as it connects the
two fundamental resources behind quantum technologies: single-particle
contextuality, which supplies the power for quantum computation, and
two-particle non-locality, which allows for quantum secure communication. The
theorem relies on three axioms: (i) There is a maximum speed for propagation of
information, (ii) single particles can exhibit contextuality, (iii) two
separated particles can exhibit Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) correlations.
Here we report the first experimental test of the free will theorem. We used
pairs of hyper-entangled photons entangled in path and polarization and
enforced the conditions for invoking axiom (i) by measuring each photon in a
different laboratory. We certified axiom (ii) by testing the violation of the
Peres-Mermin non-contextuality inequality and axiom (iii) by showing EPR
correlations between the two laboratories. The three axioms imply an upper
bound on the sum of the correlations among the outcomes of sequential
measurements in the same laboratory and the correlations between the outcomes
in both laboratories. We observed a violation of this bound by more than 66

even number of projectors. In most of the cases, the number of KS sets produced
is large and its production is generally aided by computer calculation.
However, manually generation of KS sets are also reported previously for qutrit

to generate manually KS sets, with respect to Mermin pentagram, that can be
used for the parity proof of KS theorem in a state space of eight-dimensional

single ion and an always-on thermal environment. The internal degree of freedom
of the ion is chosen as the working fluid, while the motional degree of freedom
can be used as the cold bath. We show, that by adiabatically changing the local
magnetic field, the work efficiency can be asymptotically made unity. We
propose a projective measurement of the internal state of the ion that mimics
the release of heat into the cold bath during the engine cycle. In our
proposal, the coupling to the hot and the cold baths need not be switched off
and on in an alternative fashion during the engine cycle, unlike other existing
proposals of QOE. This renders the proposal experimentally feasible using the

completable, small set of $n$-party ($n\geq3$) orthogonal product states, with
$2n(d-1)$ members in $(d)^{\otimes n}$ dimensions ($d\geq2$), imposing the
condition that no party is able to begin with a nontrivial and orthogonality
preserving measurement in $d\times d$ dimensions. In fact, it is possible to
construct a multipartite nonlocal orthogonal product basis in $(d)^{\otimes n}$
dimensions which contains fewer than $2n(d-1)$ such states (along with other
product states) and that does not satisfy the above mentioned condition. As a
result of which some information, useful for state discrimination, can be
extracted without disturbing the orthogonality of the post measurement states.
So, imposing such a condition, is related to the stronger form of nonlocality.
Finally, it is shown that a $2\times2$ maximally entangled state as resource,
along with a local protocol, is sufficient for perfect discrimination of such a
nonlocal set of n-party orthogonal product states in $(d)^{\otimes n}$

Spectrally factorable photon pairs can be generated by incorporating a
broadband pump pulse and a group-velocity matching (GVM) condition in a

photon is in the near IR, close to the peak detection efficiency of

factorability of the SPDC source and consequently high purity (90%) of the

suitable for time-multiplexing techniques, enabling a pseudo-deterministic
single-photon source, a critical resource for optical quantum information and

  an emergent universality class</title><description>  Entropic Dynamics (ED) is a framework that allows the formulation of
dynamical theories as an application of entropic methods of inference. In the
generic application of ED to derive the Schroedinger equation for N particles
the dynamics is a non-dissipative diffusion in which the system follows a
&quot;Brownian&quot; trajectory with fluctuations superposed on a smooth drift. We show
that there is a family of ED models that differ at the &quot;microscopic&quot; or
sub-quantum level in that one can enhance or suppress the fluctuations relative
to the drift. Nevertheless, members of this family belong to the same
universality class in that they all lead to the same emergent Schroedinger
behavior at the &quot;macroscopic&quot; or quantum level. The model in which fluctuations
are totally suppressed is of particular interest: the system evolves along the
smooth lines of probability flow. Thus ED includes the Bohmian or causal form
of quantum mechanics as a special limiting case. We briefly explore a different
universality class -- a non-dissipative dynamics with microscopic fluctuations
but no quantum potential. The Bohmian limit of these hybrid models is
equivalent to classical mechanics. Finally we show that the Heisenberg
uncertainty relation is unaffected either by enhancing or suppressing
microscopic fluctuations or by switching off the quantum potential.

  utilizing spatio-temporal controls</title><description>  Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) offer the potential to examine quantum
behavior at large length and time scales, as well as forming promising
candidates for quantum technology applications. Thus, the manipulation of BECs
using control fields is a topic of prime interest. We consider BECs in the mean
field model of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which contains linear and
nonlinear features, both of which are subject to control. In this work we
report successful optimal control simulations of a one dimensional GPE by
modulating the linear and nonlinear terms to stimulate transitions into excited
coherent modes. The linear and nonlinear controls are allowed to freely vary
over space and time to seek their optimal forms. The determination of the
excited coherent modes targeted for optimization is numerically performed
through an adaptive imaginary time propagation method. Numerical simulations
are performed for optimal control of mode-to-mode transitions between the
ground coherent mode and excited modes of a BEC trapped in a harmonic well. The
results show greater than 99% success for nearly all trials utilizing
reasonable initial guesses for the controls, and analysis of the optimal
controls reveals primarily direct transitions between initial and target modes.
The success of using solely the nonlinearity term as a control opens up further
research toward exploring novel control mechanisms inaccessible to linear
Schr\&quot;odinger-type systems.

quantum states and measurements characterization in a device-independent
manner, i.e., without invoking any assumption about the measurement or the

provides a device-independent lower bound on the generalized robustness of

  Annealer</title><description>  In a recent paper Lechner, Hauke and Zoller (LHZ) described a means to
translate a Hamiltonian of $N$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles with 'all-to-all'
interactions into a larger physical lattice with only on-site energies and
local parity constraints. LHZ used this mapping to propose a novel form of
quantum annealing. Here we provide a stabiliser-based formulation within which
we can describe both this prior approach and a wide variety of variants.
Examples include a triangular array supporting all-to-all connectivity, and
moreover arrangements requiring only $2N$ or $N\log N$ spins but providing
interesting bespoke connectivities. Further examples show that arbitrarily high
order logical terms can be efficiently realised, even in a strictly 2D layout.
Our stabilisers can correspond to either even-parity constraints, as in the LHZ
proposal, or as odd-parity constraints. Considering the latter option applied
to the original LHZ layout, we note it may simplify the physical realisation
since the required ancillas are only spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems (i.e. qubits,
rather than qutrits) and moreover the interactions are very simple. We make a
preliminary assessment of the impact of this design choices by simulating small
(few-qubit) systems; we find some indications that the new variant may maintain
a larger minimum energy gap during the annealing process.

quantum state of light using the mechanical degree of freedom as a controlled
beam splitter. Preparing the mechanical resonator in non-classical states
enables an optomechanical Stern-Gerlach interferometer. When the mechanical
resonator has a small coherent amplitude it acts as a quantum control,
entangling the optical and mechanical degrees of freedom. As the coherent
amplitude of the resonator increases, we recover single photon and two-photon

two-photon interference is particularly sensitive to coherent excitations in
the mechanical resonator and this could form the basis of an optically

In the rotating wave approximation (RWA), all eigen-values and eigen-functions
of this model are obtained exactly. Assuming that initially the field is
prepared in the Wigner cat state (WCS) and the two-level atom is in the excited
state, it has been shown that the atomic Rabi oscillations exhibit a
quasi-periodic behavior in the collapse and revival patterns. The influence of
the deformation parameter on the time evolution of non-classical features of
the radiation field such as the sub-Poissonian statistics and squeezing effect

maximally entangled atom-field states. In this note it is shown that the high

paper proposes an experiment to demonstrate the block universe using
interplanetary distances and high relative speeds such as those accessible

signals exchanged between Earth and the Orbiter which reveal a time interval of
some tens of milliseconds in the future of the Earth which is already in the

since the magnitude of the time interval can in principle be increased in
proportion to the distances and speeds over which it is performed, an observer

only explanation that fits these observations is a block universe in which all
events in the past, present and future of any observer are equally enfolded

  Energy spectrum reflection symmetry of quasi-exactly solvable models,
  revisited</title><description>  The phenomenon of duality reflects a link between the behaviour of a system
in different regimes. The goal of this work is to expose the classical origins
of such links, and to demonstrate how they come to life in some quasi-exactly

the Riemannian surface of the classical momentum, we reveal that the
abbreviated classical action possesses a symmetry which holds also at the

  measurement</title><description>  Remote state preparation (RSP) provides an indirect way of manipulating
quantum information based on the nonlocal effect of quantum measurement.
Although RSP has been demonstrated in recent years to remotely prepare
multi-photon states, quantum measurement on the same number of photons was
required, i.e., to prepare N-photon states via RSP, quantum measurement on the
other N-photons was required, hence significantly limiting practicality and
applicability of RSP. Here we report the first experimental demonstration of
remote preparation of three-photon entangled states by measuring only a
single-photon entangled with the three photons. We further generalize our
protocol to prepare multi-photon entangled states with arbitrary photon number
and purity via single-photon measurement. As our RSP scheme relies on the
nonlinearity induced by single-photon measurement, it enables quantum state
engineering of multi-photon entangled states beyond the linear optical limit.
Our results are expected to have significant impacts on quantum metrology and
quantum information processing.

ultracold atoms by using a two-component (spinor) atomic Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) confined in a bilayer geometry. The SOC of the Rashba type is
created if the atoms pick up a {\pi} phase after completing a cyclic transition
between four combined spin-layer states composed of two spin and two layer
states. The cyclic coupling of the spin-layer states is carried out by
combining an intralayer Raman coupling and an interlayer laser assisted
tunneling. We theoretically determine the ground-state phases of the
spin-orbit-coupled BEC for various strengths of the atom-atom interaction and
the laser-assisted coupling. It is shown that the bilayer scheme provides a
diverse ground-state phase diagram. In an intermediate range of the atom-light
coupling two interlacing lattices of half- skyrmions and half-antiskyrmions are
spontaneously created. In the strong-coupling regime, where the SOC of the
Rashba-type is formed, the ground state represents plane-wave or standing-wave
phases depending on the interaction between the atoms. A variational analysis
is shown to be in a good agreement with the numerical results.

The first implementation realizes a spin waveguide via Rydberg states in a

localized vibrations of a string of trapped ions. For both architectures, we
show that strong chirality can be obtained by a proper design of synthetic
gauge fields in the couplings from the nodes to the waveguide. In the Rydberg
case, this is achieved via intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in the dipole-dipole
interactions, while for the trapped ions it is obtained by engineered sideband
transitions. We take long-range couplings into account that appear naturally in
these implementations, discuss useful experimental parameters, and analyze
potential error sources. Finally, we describe effects that can be observed in
these implementations within state-of-the-art technology, such as the

further assert that the same is enforced due to no-signaling condition. To this

genuine multiparty non locality. We analytically show that, in the Svetlichny

nano-particle electrodes. Assuming identical emitters that are coupled
collectively to the plasmon mode but are otherwise subject to independent
relaxation channels, we show that symmetry constraints on the total system
density matrix imply a drastic reduction in the numerical complexity. For
$N_{\text{m}}$ three-level molecules we may thus represent the density matrix
by a number of terms scaling as $(N_{\rm m}+8)!/(8!N_{\rm m}!)$ instead of
$9^{N_{\text{m}}}$, and this allows exact simulations of up to

compensate strong plasmon damping and lead to the population of high plasmon

based on the plasmon reduced density matrix. With this approach, we have
extended the simulations to more than $50$ molecules and shown that the plasmon

on recently formulated general description of open quantum gravitational
systems, we analyse the propagation of scalar, electromagnetic, and
gravitational waves on both long and short time scales with respect to their
mean frequencies. For the long time propagation, the Markov approximation is
employed that neglects the effects of initial conditions of these waves. In
this case, despite intuitively expected decoherence and dissipation from the
noisy spacetime, we show that such phenomena turn out to be completely
suppressed for scalar bosons, photons, and gravitons, which are coupled to
gravity but otherwise free. The short time effects are then recovered through
the transient non-Markovian evolution. Focusing on scalar bosons in initially
incoherent states, we find that the resulting quantum dissipation depend
strongly on the distribution of the particle momentum states. We further
identify a hitherto undiscovered collective anti-dissipation mechanism for a
large number of particles. The surprising new effect tends to &quot;bundle&quot;
identical particles within a sharply distributed momentum states having a width
inversely proportional to the particle number due to the thermal fluctuations,

function, we show that the sine-Gordon model on an analogue curved spacetime
arises as the effective quantum field theory for phase fluctuations of a weakly
imperfect Bose gas on an incompressible background superfluid flow, when these
fluctuations are restricted to a subspace of the single-particle Hilbert space.
We consider bipartitions of the single-particle Hilbert space relevant to
experiments on ultracold bosonic atomic or molecular gases, including, e.g.,
restriction to high or low energy sectors of the dynamics, and spatial
bipartition corresponding to tunnel-coupled planar Bose gases. By assuming full
unitary quantum control in the low energy subspace of a trapped gas, we show
that: 1) appropriately tuning the particle number statistics of the lowest
energy mode partially decouples the low and high energy sectors, allowing any
low-energy single-particle wavefunction to define a background for sine-Gordon
dynamics on curved spacetime, and 2) macroscopic occupation of a quantum
superposition of two states of the lowest two modes produces an analogue curved
spacetime depending on two background flows, with respective weights
continuously dependent on the corresponding weights of the superposed quantum

arbitrary three-terminal system in any external magnetic field, including
systems with broken time-reversal symmetry, such as chiral thermoelectrics, as
well as systems in which the magnetic field plays no role. We show that the
upper bound on efficiency at given power output is of quantum origin and is
stricter than Carnot's bound. The bound is exactly the same as previously found

from atmospheric pressure to high vacuum. Magnetic field gradients from
permanent magnets confine the particle in two dimensions, while confinement in

Specifically, how do we know whether an analog simulation of a quantum model

strongly-coupled quantum systems. The butterfly effect implies the ballistic
growth of local operators in time, which can be quantified with the &quot;butterfly&quot;
velocity $v_B$. Similarly, the Lieb-Robinson velocity places a state
independent ballistic upper bound on the size of time evolved operators in
non-relativistic lattice models. Here, we argue that $v_B$ is a state-dependent
effective Lieb-Robinson velocity. We study the butterfly velocity in a wide
variety of quantum field theories using holography and compare with free
particle computations to understand the role of strong coupling. We find that,
depending on the way length and time scale, $v_B$ acquires a temperature
dependence and decreases towards the IR. We also comment on experimental

  Study of Recent Developments on the Quantum State</title><description>  Quantum mechanics notoriously faces the measurement problem, the problem that
if read thoroughly, it implies the nonexistence of definite outcomes in
measurement procedures. A plausible reaction to this and to related problems is
to regard a system's quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ merely as an indication of
our lack of knowledge about the system, i.e., to interpret it epistemically.
However, there are radically different ways to spell out such an epistemic view
of the quantum state. We here investigate recent developments in the branch
that introduces hidden variables $\lambda$ in addition to the quantum state
$|\psi\rangle$ and has its roots in Einstein's views. In particular, we
confront purported achievements of a concrete model that has been considered to
serve as evidence for an epistemic view of the envisioned kind, as well as
specific no-go results and their import. It will be argued that while an
epistemic account of the particular kind is not straightforwardly ruled out by
the no-go results, they demonstrate that the evidential character of the
model(s) discussed rests on a rather shaky foundation, and that they make some
achievements widely recognized in the literature appear worthy of doubt.

chemical and physical properties of the quantum state described by the three

quantities is practically impossible up until now, even for the very few
systems where their Schr\&quot;odinger equation is exactly solved. In this work, the
R\'enyi entropies of Rydberg (highly-excited) hydrogenic states are explicitly
calculated in terms of the quantum numbers and the parameter $p$. To do that we
use a methodology which first connects these quantities to the
$\mathcal{L}_{p}$-norms $N_{n,l}(p)$ of the Laguerre polynomials which
characterize the state's wavefunction. Then, the R\'enyi, Shannon and Tsallis
entropies of the Rydberg states are determined by calculating the asymptotics
($n\rightarrow\infty$) of these Laguerre norms. Finally, these quantities are
numerically examined in terms of the quantum numbers and the nuclear charge.

them as Ising spin models which are implemented using physical qubits. The
solution of the optimisation problem then corresponds to the ground state of
the system. Quantum tunnelling is harnessed to enable the system to move to the
ground state in a potentially highly non-convex energy landscape. A major
difficulty in encoding optimization problems in physical quantum annealing
devices is the fact that many real world optimisation problems require
interactions of higher connectivity as well as multi-body terms beyond the
limitations of the physical hardware. In this work we address the question of
how to implement multi-body interactions using hardware which natively only
provides two-body interactions. The main result is an efficient circuit design
of such multi-body terms using superconducting flux qubits. It is then shown
how this circuit can be used as a unit cell of a scalable architecture by
applying it to a recently proposed embedding technique for constructing an
architecture of logical qubits with arbitrary connectivity using physical
qubits which have nearest-neighbour four-body interactions.

interacting with a classical gravitational field. In particular, we analyze in
details the ultimate bounds to precision imposed by quantum mechanics and study
the effects of gravity in a variety of settings. Our results show that the
presence of a gravitational field generally leads to a precision gain, which
can be significant in a regime half-way between the quantum and classical
domains. We also address quantum enhancement to precision, i.e. the advantages
coming from taking into account the quantum nature of the probe particle, and
show that non-classicality is indeed a relevant resource for mass estimation.
In particular, we suggest schemes for mass-sensing measurements using quantum
probes and show that upon employing non-classical states like quantum coherent
superpositions one may improve precisions by orders of magnitude. In addition,
we discuss the compatibility of the weak equivalence principle (WEP) within the
quantum regime using as a guide the notion of Fisher Information. We find that
the information on the probe's mass that can be extracted through position
measurements is unchanged by turning on a uniform gravitational field. This
conclusion is somehow at variance with certain views expressed in the
literature that the WEP cannot hold in the quantum regime. In fact, our results
show that in an information-theoretic framework, no clash occurs between
quantum mechanics and the WEP.

The distribution exhibits a sharp cut-off in the high concurrence limit,

gradually projecting the system to two even subspaces and an odd subspace. We

Our scheme can be based on any classical (leveled) fully homomorphic encryption

Interestingly, by combining mathematically the coherence of formation to the

nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond, and target spins as the two systems are
tuned into resonance. By optically monitoring the spin relaxation time ($T_1$)
of the probe spin while varying the amplitude of an applied static magnetic

ensemble of $^{14}$N impurities surrounding the probe spin within the diamond,
with each impurity comprising an electron spin 1/2 and a nuclear spin 1. The
intrinsically large bandwidth of the technique and probe properties allows us
to detect both electron spin transitions -- in the GHz range -- and nuclear
spin transitions -- in the MHz range -- of the $^{14}$N spin targets. The
measured frequencies are found to be in excellent agreement with theoretical
expectations, and allow us to infer the hyperfine, quadrupole and gyromagnetic
constants of the target spins. Analysis of the strength of the resonances
obtained in the $T_1$-MR spectrum reveals that the electron spin transitions
are probed via dipole interactions, while the nuclear spin resonances are
dramatically enhanced by hyperfine coupling and an electron-mediated process.
Finally, we investigate theoretically the possibility of performing $T_1$-MR
spectroscopy on nuclear spins without hyperfine interaction and predict
single-proton sensitivity using current technology. This work establishes
$T_1$-MR as a simple yet powerful technique for nanoscale MR spectroscopy, with

Ladder-system cooling, the cooling rate degrades by orders of magnitude at

  of steering outcomes</title><description>  When two qubits AB are in an appropriate state, by making different
measurements on A, Alice can non-locally steer Bob's system B into different
ensembles. This famous phenomenon is known as quantum steering, or
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering. Importantly, quantum steering establishes the
correspondence not only between a measurement on A (made by Alice) and an
ensemble of B (owned by Bob) but also between each of Alice's measurement
outcomes and an unnormalized conditional state of Bob's system. The
unnormalized conditional states of B corresponding to all possible measurement
outcomes of Alice are called Alice's steering outcomes. We show that,
surprisingly, the $4$-dimensional geometry of Alice's steering outcomes
completely determines both the non-separability of the two-qubit state and its
steerability from her side. Consequently, the problem of classifying two-qubit
states into non-separable and steerable classes is equivalent to geometrically
classifying certain $4$-dimensional twisted double-cones.

consistent, provided that the likelihood model is correct, but the maximum
likelihood estimators may have bias for any finite data set. The bias of an
estimator is the difference between the expected value of the estimate and the
true value of the parameter being estimated. This paper investigates bias in
the widely used maximum likelihood quantum state tomography. Our goal is to
understand how the amount of bias depends on factors such as the purity of the
true state, the number of measurements performed, and the number of different
bases in which the system is measured. For that, we perform numerical
experiments that simulate optical homodyne tomography under various conditions,
perform tomography, and estimate bias in the purity of the estimated state. We
find that estimates of higher purity states exhibit considerable bias, such
that the estimates have lower purity than the true states.

addition, we distinguish between total and semiquantum correlations and obtain
some relations between them. Finally, we obtain analytical expressions of the

systems, the maximum spatial and angular resolutions are fundamentally linked;
thereby, the maximum achievable depth of field is inversely proportional to the
spatial resolution. We propose to take advantage of the second-order

this paper, we demonstrate that the momentum/position correlation of chaotic

efficient schemes for enacting the elementary quantum operations from which
quantum computer programs are constructed. The opposing requirements of
well-protected quantum data and fast quantum operations must be balanced to
maintain the integrity of the quantum information throughout the computation.
One important approach to quantum operations is to use an extra quantum system
- an ancilla - to interact with the quantum data register. Ancillas can mediate
interactions between separated quantum registers, and by using fresh ancillas
for each quantum operation, data integrity can be preserved for longer. This
review provides an overview of the basic concepts of the gate model quantum
computer architecture, including the different possible forms of information
encodings - from base two up to continuous variables - and a more detailed

in a holographic theory to the area of a corresponding bulk minimal surface.
Using the max flow-min cut principle, a theorem from network theory, we rewrite
the RT formula in a way that does not make reference to the minimal surface.
Instead, we invoke the notion of a &quot;flow&quot;, defined as a divergenceless
norm-bounded vector field, or equivalently a set of Planck-thickness &quot;bit
threads&quot;. The entanglement entropy of a boundary region is given by the maximum
flux out of it of any flow, or equivalently the maximum number of bit threads
that can emanate from it. The threads thus represent entanglement between
points on the boundary, and naturally implement the holographic principle. As
we explain, this new picture clarifies several conceptual puzzles surrounding
the RT formula. We give flow-based proofs of strong subadditivity and related
properties; unlike the ones based on minimal surfaces, these proofs correspond
in a transparent manner to the properties' information-theoretic meanings. We
also briefly discuss certain technical advantages that the flows offer over
minimal surfaces. In a mathematical appendix, we review the max flow-min cut
theorem on networks and on Riemannian manifolds, and prove in the network case
that the set of max flows varies Lipshitz continuously in the network

approximate joint measurement of two or more quantum observables. The aim of
this paper is to provide methods to compute optimal bounds of this type. The
basic method is semidefinite programming, which we apply to arbitrary finite
collections of projective observables on a finite dimensional Hilbert space.
The quantification of errors is based on an arbitrary cost function, which
assigns a penalty to getting result $x$ rather than y, for any pair (x,y). This
induces a notion of optimal transport cost for a pair of probability
distributions, and we include an appendix with a short summary of optimal
transport theory as needed in our context. There are then different ways to
form an overall figure of merit from the comparison of distributions. We
consider three, which are related to different physical testing scenarios. The
most thorough test compares the transport distances between the marginals of a
joint measurement and the reference observables for every input state. Less
demanding is a test just on the states for which a &quot;true value&quot; is known in the
sense that the reference observable yields a definite outcome. Finally, we can
measure a deviation as a single expectation value by comparing the two
observables on the two parts of a maximally entangled state. All three error
quantities have the property that they vanish if and only if the tested
observable is equal to the reference. The theory is illustrated with some
characteristic examples.

to the optimal phase sensitivity under this type of noise. In a sequential

correlation measures for an arbitrary bipartite state. The measures utilize the
general Schatten $p$-norm to quantify the amount of departure from the
necessary and sufficient condition of classicality of correlations provided by
the concept of NDLID. We show that for the case of Hilbert-Schmidt norm, i.e.

reliability of the proposed measures is checked from the information theoretic
perspective. Also, the monotonicity behavior of these measures under LOCC is
exemplified. The results reveal that for the general pure bipartite states
these measures have an upper bound which is an entanglement monotone in its own

Phase Transitions (QPT) and Excited-State Quantum Phase transitions (ESQPT), is
analyzed for atom-field systems. While it has been speculated that the onset of
hard chaos is associated with ESQPT based in the resonant case, the
off-resonant cases show clearly that both phenomena, ESQPT and chaos, respond
to different mechanisms. The results are supported in a detailed numerical
study of the dynamics of the semiclassical Hamiltonian of the Dicke model. The
appearance of chaos is quantified calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent for
a wide sample of initial conditions in the whole available phase space for a
given energy. The percentage of the available phase space with chaotic
trajectories is evaluated as a function of energy and coupling between the
qubit and bosonic part, allowing to obtain maps in the space of coupling and
energy, where ergodic properties are observed in the model. Different sets of
Hamiltonian parameters are considered, including resonant and off-resonant
cases.

cold $\Lambda-$type atoms induced by a quantum control field in multi-mode
coherent states and compare it with the transparency created by the classical
light of the same intensity. We show that the perfect coincidence is achieved
only in the case of a single-mode coherent state, whereas the transparency
sharply decreases, when the number of the modes exceeds the mean number of
control photons in the medium. The origin of the effect is the modification of
photon statistics in the control field with increasing the number of the modes
that weakens its interaction with atoms resulting in a strong probe absorption.
For the same reason, the probe pulse transforms from EIT-based slow-light into
superluminal propagation caused by the absorption.

  Broadcasting, and In-between</title><description>  One of the central features of quantum theory is that there are pairs of
quantum observables that cannot be measured simultaneously. This
incompatibility of quantum observables is a necessary ingredient in several
quantum phenomena, such as measurement uncertainty relations, violation of Bell
inequalities and steering. Two quantum observables that admit a simultaneous
measurement are, in this respect, classical. A finer classification of
classicality can be made by formulating four symmetric relations on the set of
observables that are stronger than compatibility; they are broadcastability,
one-side broadcastability, mutual nondisturbance and nondisturbance. It is
proven that the five relations form a hierarchy, and their differences in terms
of the required devices needed in a simultaneous measurement is explained. All
the four relations stronger than compatibility are completely characterized in
the case of qubit observables.

coupled to a continuum, based on time reversal in the continuum after decay, is
theoretically suggested. Provided that the energy spectrum of the network is
symmetric around a reference energy and symmetric energy states are coupled the
same way to the common continuum, ideal perfect state transfer can be obtained
after time reversal. In particular, it is shown that in a linear tight-binding
chain a quantum state can be transformed into its mirror image with respect to
the center of the chain after a controllable time. As compared to quantum
mirror image based on coherent transport in a static chain with properly
tailored inhomogeneous hopping rates, our method does not require hopping rate
engineering and is less sensitive to disorder for long transfer times.

  generalization of the Chernoff-Hoeffding inequality</title><description>  This work is devoted to explore fundamental aspects of the spectral
properties of few-body general operators. We first consider the following
question: when we know the probability distributions of a set of observables,
what can we way on the probability distribution of the summation of them? In
considering arbitrary operators, we could not obtain a useful information over
third order moment, while under the assumption of the few-body operators, we
can rigorously prove a much stronger bound on the moment generating function
for arbitrary quantum states. Second, by the use of this bound, we generalize
the Chernoff inequality (or the Hoeffding inequality), which characterizes the
asymptotic decay of the probability distribution for the product states by the
Gaussian decay. In the present form, the Chernoff inequality can be applied to
a summation of independent local observables (e.g., single-site operators). We
extend the range of application of the Chernoff inequality to the generic
few-body observables.

lattice that is driven periodically in time by a modulation of the lattice
depth. Assuming the system to be prepared in the lowest band, we compute the
excitation spectrum numerically. Moreover, we estimate the effective coupling
parameters for resonant interband excitation processes analytically, employing
degenerate perturbation theory in Floquet space. Studying their dependence on
both the frequency and the strength of the driving, we find that below a
threshold driving strength, interband excitations are suppressed exponentially
with respect to the inverse driving frequency. For sufficiently low
frequencies, this leads to a rather sudden onset of interband heating, once the
driving strength reaches the threshold. We argue that this behavior is rather
generic and should be found in lattice systems that are driven by other forms
of periodic forcing. Our results are relevant for Floquet engineering, where a
lattice system is driven periodically in time in order to endow it with novel
properties like the emergence of a strong artificial magnetic field or a
topological band structure. In this context, interband excitation processes
correspond to detrimental heating.

unlike unitary operators, local non-unitary operators generically create
non-local excitations. We present a local picture for quantum systems in which
localized experimentalists can only act through localized Hamiltonian

localized unitary operators model certain quantum quenches exactly. We show how
the Reeh-Schlieder theorem follows intuitively from basic properties of
entanglement, non-unitary operators, and the local picture. We show that a

interpreted as the logic of (closed) subspaces of a Hilbert space. There is a
progression from the usual Boolean logic of subsets to the &quot;quantum logic&quot; of
subspaces of a general vector space--which is then specialized to the closed
subspaces of a Hilbert space. But there is a &quot;dual&quot; progression. The notion of
a partition (or quotient set or equivalence relation) is dual (in a
category-theoretic sense) to the notion of a subset. Hence the Boolean logic of
subsets has a dual logic of partitions. Then the dual progression is from that
logic of partitions to the quantum logic of direct-sum decompositions (i.e.,
the vector space version of a set partition) of a general vector space--which
can then be specialized to the direct-sum decompositions of a Hilbert space.
This allows the logic to express measurement by any self-adjoint operators
rather than just the projection operators associated with subspaces. In this
introductory paper, the focus is on the quantum logic of direct-sum
decompositions of a finite-dimensional vector space (including such a Hilbert
space). The primary special case examined is finite vector spaces over 2 where
the pedagogical model of quantum mechanics over sets (QM/Sets) is formulated.
In the Appendix, the combinatorics of direct-sum decompositions of finite
vector spaces over GF(q) is analyzed with computations for the case of QM/Sets
where q=2.

space and performs all quantum measurements at the end of the computation. In
particular, the problem of computing entries of $H^{-1}$ for an explicit
well-conditioned $n \times n$ matrix $H$ is complete for unitary quantum
logspace.
  We then show that the problem of approximating to high precision the least
eigenvalue of a positive semidefinite matrix $H$, encoded as a circuit, gives a
second characterization of unitary quantum space complexity. In the process we
also establish an equivalence between unitary quantum space-bounded classes and
certain QMA proof systems. As consequences, we establish that QMA with
exponentially small completeness-soundness gap is equal to PSPACE, that
determining whether a local Hamiltonian is frustration-free is PSPACE-complete,
and give a provable setting in which the ability to prepare PEPS states gives
less computational power than the ability to prepare the ground state of a
generic local Hamiltonian.

formulation of quantum theory to canonical loop quantum cosmology. Conventional
quantum theory relies crucially on &quot;measurements&quot; to convert unrealized quantum
potentialities into physical outcomes that can be assigned probabilities. In
the early universe and other physical contexts in which there are no observers
or measuring apparatus (or indeed, in any closed quantum system), what criteria
determine which alternative outcomes may be realized and what their
probabilities are? In the consistent histories formulation it is the vanishing
of interference between the branch wave functions describing alternative
histories -- as determined by the system's decoherence functional -- that
determines which alternatives may be assigned probabilities. We describe the
consistent histories formulation and how it may be applied to canonical loop
quantum cosmology, describing in detail the application to homogeneous and
isotropic cosmological models with scalar matter. We show how the theory may be
used to make definite physical predictions in the absence of &quot;observers&quot;. As an
application, we demonstrate how the theory predicts that loop quantum models
&quot;bounce&quot; from large volume to large volume, while conventional
&quot;Wheeler-DeWitt&quot;-quantized universes are invariably singular. We also briefly
indicate the relation to other work.

sometimes compared to a &quot;quantum coin&quot;: a coin with infinitely many sets of two
sides which can only be tossed when specifying the desired set. However, this
picture fails to capture the richness of the quantum world, where qubit
measurements are not necessarily binary. Consequently, when pairs of entangled
qubits are measured locally, quantum theory predicts correlations that can
neither be explained as produced by locally tossing classical coins nor
explained by locally tossing quantum coins. However, this last prediction was
unconfirmed until now since it requires the observation of a very small effect
on an almost perfectly entangled qubit-qubit state. Here we present an
experiment on pairs of entangled photonic qubits violating by more than 8
standard deviations a new Bell-like correlation inequality, which is valid only
for binary quantum measurements. By also providing device-independent evidences
that our system is best described by two qubits, we prove that quantum
measurements on a qubit can be fundamentally non-binary. Since non-binary
measurements on a qubit cannot be sharp, this constitutes the first
device-independent certification of a genuine generalized quantum measurement.

physics. It is also key in the quest to reconcile the ostensibly inconsistent
laws of the quantum and classical realms, as it confers physical significance
to reduced density matrices, the essential tools of decoherence theory.
Following Bohr's Copenhagen interpretation, textbooks postulate the Born rule
outright. However, recent attempts to derive it from other quantum principles
have been successful, holding promise for simplifying and clarifying the
quantum foundational bedrock. A major family of derivations is based on
envariance, a recently discovered symmetry of entangled quantum states. Here,
we identify and experimentally test three premises central to these
envariance-based derivations, thus demonstrating, in the microworld, the
symmetries from which the Born rule is derived. Further, we demonstrate
envariance in a purely local quantum system, showing its independence from
relativistic causality.

experiment. It reveals which slit photons go through while retaining the (self)
interference of all the photons collected. The idea is to image the slits using
a lens with a narrow aperture and scan across the area where the interference
fringes would be. The aperture is wide enough to separate the slits in the
images, i.e., telling which way. The illumination pattern over the pupil is
reconstructed from the series of slit intensities. The result matches the
double-slit interference pattern well. As such, the photon's wave-like and
particle-like behaviors are observed simultaneously in a straightforward and
thus unambiguous way. The implication is far reaching. For one, it presses
hard, at least philosophically, for a consolidated wave-and-particle
description of quantum objects, because we can no longer dismiss such a
challenge on the basis that the two behaviors do not manifest at the same time.
A bold proposal is to forgo the concept of particles. Then, Heisenberg's
uncertainty principle would be purely a consequence of waves without being

We obtain the phase diagram of the Anderson/quantum-percolation model to

computation to an untrusted quantum server while fully maintaining privacy
(blindness) is one of the big open questions in quantum cryptography. Both yes
and no answers have important practical and theoretical consequences, and the
question seems genuinely hard. The state-of-the-art approaches to securely
delegating quantum computation, without exception, rely on granting the client
modest quantum powers, or on additional, non-communicating, quantum servers. In
this work, we consider the single server setting, and push the boundaries of
the minimal devices of the client, which still allow for blind quantum
computation. Our approach is based on the observation that, in many blind
quantum computing protocols, the &quot;quantum&quot; part of the protocol, from the
clients perspective, boils down to the establishing classical-quantum
correlations (independent from the computation) between the client and the
server, following which the steering of the computation itself requires only
classical communication. Here, we abstract this initial preparation phase,
specifically for the Universal Blind Quantum Computation protocol of Broadbent,
Fitzsimons and Kashefi. We identify sufficient criteria on the powers of the
client, which still allow for secure blind quantum computation. We work in a
universally composable framework, and provide a series of protocols, where each
step reduces the number of differing states the client needs to be able to
prepare. As the limit of such reductions, we show that the capacity to prepare
just two pure states, which have an arbitrarily high overlap (thus are
arbitrarily close to identical), suffices for efficient and secure blind
quantum computation.

well-defined positive Wigner function describing the state and find that
although the states possess positive local Wigner functions, they exhibit
negative Wigner functions for the global states. Using the negativity of Wigner
function as an indicator of nonclassicality, we show that despite these states
possess different negativities of the Wigner function, they do not reveal this
difference as phase space nonclassicalities such as negativity of the Mandel
$Q$ parameter or quadrature squeezing. We then concentrate on quantum
correlation of these states and show that quantum discord and local quantum
uncertainty, as two well-defined measures of quantum correlation, manifest the
difference between negativity of the Wigner functions. The non-Gaussianity of
these states is also examined and show that the difference in behavior of their
non-Gaussianity is the same as the difference between negativity of their

  Leggett-Garg Inequalities</title><description>  A protocol is proposed for measuring the temporal correlation functions of
the bivalent variables used in the Leggett-Garg inequalities which does not
involve ideal negative measurements or weak measurements. It involves an
auxiliary system (ancilla) coupled to the system with two sequential CNOT
gates, and the two-time histories of the system (whose probabilities yield the
correlation function) are determined in a single-time measurement of the
ancilla. We find that the system state after the second CNOT gate disentangles
from the ancilla and moreover, the effect of the interaction on the system is
undetectable after the second interaction even though the interaction is
invasive at earlier times. We ask whether this presents a case for a weakened
form of the usual assumption of non-invasive measurability (NIM) appropriate to
two-time histories, in which the two sequential measurements are allowed to be
invasive as long as the final system state is unaffected by the two earlier
measurements and we explore hidden variable explanations of this possibility.
An improved protocol is explored in which the effect on the system remains
undetectable but the ancilla initial state is specially chosen in order to
minimize disturbance by the CNOT gates, so this protocol satisfies the
conventional form of NIM to a controllable approximation, and the correlation
function is read off from the small bias around zero disturbance.

quantum electrodynamics occurring when the interaction between a matter
excitation and the electromagnetic field cannot be described by usual
perturbation theory. This is generally achieved by coupling an excitation with
large oscillator strength to the confined electromagnetic mode of an optical
microcavity. In this work we demonstrate that strong/ultra-strong coupling can
also take place in the absence of optical confinement. We have studied the
non-perturbative spontaneous emission of collective excitations in a dense
two-dimensional electron gas that superradiantly decays into free space. By
using a quantum model based on the input-output formalism, we have derived the
linear optical properties of the coupled system and demonstrated that its
eigenstates are mixed light-matter particles, like in any system displaying
strong or ultra-strong light-matter interaction. Moreover, we have shown that
in the ultra-strong coupling regime, i.e. when the radiative broadening is
comparable to the matter excitation energy, the commonly used rotating-wave and
Markov approximations yield unphysical results. Finally, the input-output
formalism has allowed us to prove that Kirchhoff's law, describing thermal
emission properties, applies to our system in all the light-matter coupling
regimes considered in this work.

modulates the coupling between two photonic modes. We show that in the
adiabatic limit, this system generically realizes a dissipative optomechanical
coupling, with an effective position-dependent photonic damping rate. The
resulting quantum noise interference can be used to ground-state cool a
mechanical resonator in the unresolved sideband regime. We explicitly
demonstrate how quantum noise interference controls linear backaction effects,
and show that this interference persists even outside the adiabatic limit. For
a one-port cavity in the extreme bad-cavity limit, the interference allows one
to cancel all linear backaction effects. This allows continuous measurements of
position-squared, with no stringent constraints on the single-photon
optomechanical coupling strength. In contrast, such a complete cancellation is
not possible in the good cavity limit. This places strict bounds on the
optomechanical coupling required for quantum non-demolition measurements of
mechanical energy, even in a one-port device.

quantum Wigner molecules (QWMs) possessing definite point-group space
symmetries. These point-group symmetries are &quot;hidden&quot; (or emergent), namely
they cannot be traced in the circular single-particle densities (SPDs)
associated with the exact many-body wave functions, but they are manifested as
characteristic signatures in the ro-vibrational spectra. An example, among
many, are the few-body QWM states under a high magnetic field or at fast
rotation, which are precursor states for the fractional quantum Hall effect.
The hidden geometric symmetries can be directly revealed by using spin-resolved
conditional probability distributions, which are extracted from
configuration-interaction (CI), exact-diagonalization wave functions. The
hidden symmetries can also be revealed in the CI SPDs by reducing the symmetry
of the trap (from circular to elliptic to quasi-linear). In addition the hidden
symmetries are directly connected to the explicitly broken-symmetry (BS)
solutions of mean-field approaches, such as unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF). A
companion step of restoration of the broken symmetries via projection operators
applied on the BS-UHF solutions produces wave functions directly comparable to
the CI ones, and sheds further light into the role played by the emergence of
hidden symmetries in the exact many-body wave functions. Illustrative examples

monolithic quartz bulk acoustic wave (BAW) oscillator coupled to a
superconducting transmon qubit via an intermediate LC electrical circuit.
Monolithic quartz oscillators offer unprecedentedly high effective masses and
quality factors for the investigation of mechanical oscillators in the quantum
regime. Ground-state cooling of such mechanical modes via resonant
piezoelectric coupling to an LC circuit, which is itself sideband cooled via
coupling to a transmon qubit, is shown to be feasible. The fluorescence
spectrum of the qubit, containing motional sideband contributions due to the
couplings to the oscillator modes, is obtained and the imprint of the
electromechanical steady-state on the spectrum is determined. This allows the
qubit to function both as a cooling resource for, and transducer of, the
mechanical oscillator. The results described are relevant to any hybrid quantum
system composed of a qubit coupled to two (coupled or uncoupled) thermal
oscillator modes.

a static force can be described by quasiclassical considerations for example by
means of the acceleration theorem, at least for Hermitian systems. Here the
quasiclassical approach is extended to non-Hermitian lattices, which are of
increasing interest. The analysis is based on a generalised non-Hermitian phase
space dynamics developed recently. Applications to a single-band tight-binding
system demonstrate that many features of the quantum dynamics can be understood
from this classical description qualitatively and even quantitatively. Two
non-Hermitian and $PT$-symmetric examples are studied, a Hatano-Nelson lattice
with real coupling constants and a system with purely imaginary couplings, both
for initially localised states in space or in momentum. It is shown that the
time-evolution of the norm of the wave packet and the expectation values of
position and momentum can be described in a classical picture.

important problem in quantum information processing. Inspired by previous work
on a self-testing quantum random number generator [T. Lunghi et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 114, 150501 (2015)], we present a method to generate quantum randomness
from a prepare-and-measure scenario with independent devices. In existing
protocols, the quantum randomness depends only on a witness value (e.g.,
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt value), which is calculated with the observed
probabilities. Differently, here all the observed probabilities are directly
used to calculate the min-entropy in our method. Through numerical simulation,
we find that the min-entropy of our proposed scheme is higher than that in the
previous work when a typical untrusted Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) setup is
used. Consequently, thanks to the proposed method, more genuine quantum random
numbers may be obtained than before.

communication, spectroscopy, imaging, and signal processing. In the quantum
regime, it also offers great potential for realizing quantum networks
incorporating disparate physical systems and quantum-enhanced information
processing over a large computational space. The frequency conversion of
quantum light, such as single photons, has been extensively investigated for
the last two decades using all-optical frequency mixing, with the ultimate goal
of realizing lossless and noiseless conversion. I demonstrate another route to
this target using frequency conversion induced by cross-phase modulation in a
dispersion-managed photonic crystal fiber. Owing to the deterministic and
all-optical nature of the process, the lossless and low-noise spectral
reshaping of a single-photon wave packet in the telecommunication band has been
readily achieved with a modulation bandwidth as large as 0.4 THz. I further
demonstrate that the scheme is applicable to manipulations of a nonclassical
frequency correlation, wave packet interference, and entanglement between two
photons. This approach presents a new coherent frequency interface for photons
for quantum information processing.

quantum Yang-Mills theory from a quantum-information perspective. Our setting
is that of the hamiltonian formulation of pure Yang-Mills theory in the
temporal gauge on the lattice. Firstly, inspired by recent constructions for
$\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ lattice gauge theory, in particular, Kitaev's toric
code, we describe the gauge-invariant sector of hilbert space by introducing a
primitive quantum gate: the quantum parallel transporter. We then develop a
nonabelian generalisation of laplace interpolation to present an ansatz for the
ground state of pure Yang-Mills theory which interpolates between the weak- and
strong-coupling RG fixed points. The resulting state acquires the structure of
a tensor network, namely, a multiscale entanglement renormalisation ansatz, and
allows for the efficient computation of local observables and Wilson loops.
Various refinements of the tensor network are discussed leading to several
generalisations. Finally, the continuum limit of our ansatz as the lattice
regulator is removed is then described. This paper is intended as an abstract
for an ongoing programme: there are still many open problems.

  of the generalized Bose-Anderson model</title><description>  The exact description of the time evolution of open correlated quantum
systems remains one of the major challenges of the condensed matter theory,
specially for asymptotic long times where most numerical methods fail. Here,
the post-quench dynamics of the $N$-component Bose-Anderson impurity model is
studied in the $N\to\infty$ limit. The equilibrium phase diagram is similar to
that of the Bose-Hubbard model in that it contains local versions of the Mott
and Bose phases. Using a numerically exact procedure we are able to study the
real time evolution including asymptotic long time regimes. The formation of
long-lived transient phases is observed for quench paths crossing foreign
phases. For quenches inside the local Bose condensed phase, a dynamical phase
transition is reported, that separates the evolution towards a new equilibrium
state and a regime characterized at large times by a persistent phase rotation
of the order parameter. We explain how such non-decaying mode can exist in the
presence of a dissipative bath. We discuss the extension of our results to the
experimental relevant finite-$N$ case and their implication for the existence
of non-decaying modes in generic quantum systems in the presence of a bath.

In this work we demonstrate for the first time a class of states that are UD by
their RDMs under the assumption that the global state is pure, but fail to be
UD in the absence of that assumption. This discovery allows us to classify
quantum states according to their UD properties, with the requirement that each

of performing quantum state tomography via the measurement of local RDMs for
each class. These theoretical and experimental results advance the project of

inequality, i.e. monotonicity under quantum operations, for $\alpha\geq 1/2$.
Here we derive a necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for equality in
the data processing inequality. We first consider the special case of partial
trace, and derive a condition for equality based on the original proof of the
data processing inequality by Frank and Lieb [J. Math. Phys. 54.12 (2013), p.
122201] using a strict convexity/concavity argument. We then generalize to
arbitrary quantum operations via the Stinespring Representation Theorem. As
applications of our condition for equality in the data processing inequality,
we deduce conditions for equality in various entropic inequalities. We
formulate a R\'enyi version of the Araki-Lieb inequality and analyze the case
of equality, generalizing a result by Carlen and Lieb [Lett. Math. Phys. 101.1
(2012), pp. 1-11] about equality in the original Araki-Lieb inequality.
Furthermore, we prove a general lower bound on a R\'enyi version of the
entanglement of formation, and observe that it is saturated by states
saturating the R\'enyi version of the Araki-Lieb inequality. Finally, we prove
that the known upper bound on the entanglement fidelity in terms of the usual
fidelity is saturated only by pure states.

IBM J. Res. Dev. 48, 71 (2004)], celebrating C. H. Bennett's legacy on quantum

qualitative sense, the situation is far less clear if monogamy is intended as a
quantitative limitation on the distribution of bipartite entanglement in a
multipartite system, given some particular measure of entanglement. Here, we
clarify the most general form of a universal quantitative monogamy relation for
a bipartite measure of entanglement. We then go on to show that an important
class of entanglement measures fail to be monogamous in this most general sense
of the term, with monogamy violations becoming generic with increasing
dimension. In particular, we show that entanglement measures cannot satisfy
monogamy while at the same time faithfully capturing the entanglement of the
fully antisymmetric state in arbitrary dimension. Nevertheless, monogamy can be
recovered if one allows for dimension-dependent relations, as we show

of spin correlations in superconductivity and the Kondo effect and quantum
non-locality of non-interacting particles. Non-local entanglement is also key
to quantum computation outperforming classical computers and has now begun to
be applied to various atom and photon-based quantum information technologies.
Despite many technical advances in manipulating electron spins in solids,
entanglement control has only been realized for two coupled qubits in quantum
dots (QDs), mainly by local SWAP operations. Here we use a triple QD with three
addressable spin qubits to demonstrate phase control of locally entangled two
or three electron spins and two non-locally entangled uncoupled spins.
Singlet-triplet oscillation of two locally entangled spins in adjacent dots is
induced by a built-in local Zeeman field, and phase-modulated using the
exchange-coupled third spin as a control bit. Non-local entanglement is created
by an adiabatic transition from the local singlet to a non-local singlet over
two distant QDs with the center dot remaining uncoupled. We analyze the phase
evolution of those entangled states depending on the adiabatic transition path
to derive the three-spin-state spectrum, a prerequisite for single-qubit, SWAP
gate and other entanglement operations. Our results empower quantum information
technologies in solid-state systems by paving the way for manipulating local

Ising CFT in 1+1 space-time dimensions. This phase transition can be accessed
with classical Monte Carlo simulations, which, via a replica-trick calculation,
can be used to study the shape-dependence of the classical R\'enyi entropies
for a torus divided into two cylinders. From the second R\'enyi entropy, we
calculate the Geometrical Mutual Information (GMI) introduced by St\'ephan et.
al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 112, 127204 (2014)] and use it to extract a numerical
estimate for the value of the central charge near the tricritical point. By
comparing to the known CFT result, $c=7/10$, we demonstrate how this type of
GMI calculation can be used to estimate the position of the tricritical point
in the phase diagram.

  two-component form</title><description>  A single-step Eriksen transformation of~$1S_{1/2}$,~$2P_{1/2}$ and~$2P_{3/2}$
states of the relativistic hydrogen atom is performed exactly by expressing
each transformed function (TF) as a linear combination of eigenstates of the
Dirac Hamiltonian. The TFs are four-component spinors with vanishing two lower
components, are calculated numerically and have the same symmetries as the
initial states. For all nuclear charges~$Z \in [1\ldots 92]$ a contribution of
the initial state to TFs exceeds 86\% of the total probability density. Next
large contribution to TFs comes from delocalized states with negative energies
close to~$-m_0c^2-E_b$, where~$E_b$ is the binding energy of initial state.
Contribution of other states to TFs is less than~$0.1\%$ of the total
probability density. Other components of TFs are nearly zero which confirms
both validity of the Eriksen transformation and accuracy of the numerical
calculations. The TFs of~$1S_{1/2}$ and~$2P_{1/2}$ states are close to~$1s$
and~$2p$ states of the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom, respectively, but the TF
of~$2P_{3/2}$ state differs qualitatively from the~$2p$ state. Functions
calculated with use of a linearized Eriksen transformation, being equivalent to
the second order Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, are compared with
corresponding functions obtained by Eriksen transformation. A very good
agreement between both results is obtained.

harmonic oscillators (CHO) in the form of a modeling game. The application of
simple but restrictive rules of the game lead to conditions for an isomorphism
between Lie-algebras and real Clifford algebras. We show that the correlations
between two coupled classical oscillators find their natural description in the
Dirac algebra and allow to model aspects of special relativity, inertial
motion, electromagnetism and quantum phenomena including spin in one go. The
algebraic properties of Hamiltonian motion of low-dimensional systems can
generally be related to certain types of interactions and hence to the
dimensionality of emergent space-times. We describe the intrinsic connection
between phase space volumes of a 2-dimensional oscillator and the Dirac
algebra. In this version of a phase space interpretation of quantum mechanics
the (components of the) spinor wave-function in momentum space are abstract
canonical coordinates, and the integrals over the squared wave function
represents second moments in phase space. The wave function in ordinary
space-time can be obtained via Fourier transformation. Within this modeling
game, 3+1-dimensional space-time is interpreted as a structural property of
electromagnetic interaction. A generalization selects a series of Clifford
algebras of specific dimensions with similar properties, specifically also 10-

through a time-modulated rectilinear potential barrier, the Tien-Gordon
identity was invoked, together with its infinite energy spectrum. Here, an
exact treatment is presented which is based on the temporal wave-function
matching procedure, that led to a finite energy spectrum. In seeking the
condition governing the time evolution of the tunnelling process, the Euler
formula provided the crucial ingredient for time quantization, which
discretised the continuous time in the oscillating barrier potential and energy
harmonic equations. As a result, a finite system of inelastic scattering
channels was created. When an electron entered the elastic channel, it was
scattered, instantaneously, into finite neighbouring energy-level scattering
channels, by absorption (emission) of photon energy from (to) the oscillating
field, during the transit period across the dynamic barrier. The absorption and
emission times of barrier traversal, T_+ and T_-, respectively, were derived
for the low and high frequency regimes of the barrier oscillations.
Calculations revealed that in the low (high) frequency situation T_+= T_- (T_+&lt;

  Factor</title><description>  It is emphasized that the bunching parameter $\beta=P_B/P_D$ , i.e. the ratio
between the probability to measure two bosons and two distinguishable particles
at the same state, is a constant of motion and depends only on the overlap
between the initial wavefunctions. This ratio is equal to $\beta=2/(1+I^2)$ ,
where $I$ is the overlap integral between the initial wavefunctions. That is,
only when the initial wavefunctions are orthogonal this ratio is equal to 2,
however, this bunching ratio can be reduced to 1, when the two wavefunctions
are identical. This simple equation explains the experimental evidences of a
beam splitter. A straightforward conclusion is that by measuring the local
bunching parameter $\beta$ (at any point in space and time) it is possible to
evaluate a global parameter$ I$ (the overlap between the initial
wavefunctions). The bunching parameter is then generalized to arbitrary number
of particles, and in an analogy to the two-particles scenario, the well-known
bosonic enhancement appears only when all states are orthogonal.

At leading order for large domains, the logarithmic negativity and the

that dynamical nuclear spin polarization can strongly influence the measurement
process, making it difficult to extract the $T_2^*$ coherence time using
optical Ramsey pulses. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method for spin
coherence measurement that is based on first-order coherence of photons
generated in spin-flip Raman scattering. We show that if a quantum emitter is
driven by a weak monochromatic laser, Raman coherence is determined exclusively
by spin coherence, allowing for a direct determination of spin $T_2^*$ time.
When combined with coherence measurements on Rayleigh scattered photons, our
technique enables us to identify coherent and incoherent contributions to
resonance fluorescence, and to minimize the latter. We verify the validity of
our technique by comparing our results to those determined from Ramsey

  environment at finite temperature</title><description>  We consider a finite one-dimensional Heisenberg XYZ spin chain under the
influence of dissipative Lindblad environment obeying the Born-Markovian
constrain in presence of an external magnetic field. We apply both closed and
open boundary conditions at zero and finite temperature. We present an exact
numerical solution for the Lindblad master equation of the system in the
Liouville space. we find that, in the free spin chain (in absence of any
environment), the entanglement at all ranges evolve in time in a non-uniform
oscillatory form that changes significantly depending on the initial state,
system size and the spatial anisotropy. The oscillatory behavior is suppressed
once the system is coupled to the environment. Furthermore, the asymptotic
behavior of the entanglement, nearest neighbor and beyond, in the system under
the influence of the environment at zero temperature is very sensitive to the
x-y spatial anisotropy, which causes them to reach either a zero or a finite
sustainable steady state value regardless of the initial state of the system.
The anisotropy in the $z-$direction may enhance the entanglement depending on
the interplay with the magnetic field applied in the same direction. As the
temperature is raised, the steady state of the short range entanglements is
found to be robust within very small non-zero temperature range, which depends
critically on the spatial anisotropy of the system. The entanglement at each
range depends differently on the spatial anisotropy. Moreover, the end to end
entanglement transfer time and speed through the open boundary chain vary
significantly based on the degree of anisotropy and the temperature of the
environment.

theoretically as well as experimentally through violation of some \emph{local

particle in real experiment. One has to rather address beam of particles which
may cause dilution of nonlocal behavior. Moreover, classical behavior of all
physical phenomena at macroscopic limit gives a general intuition that any
\emph{physical} theory for describing microscopic phenomena should resemble
classical physics at macroscopic regime. In the 2-2-2 scenario (two parties,
each performing two measurements, each measurement with two outcomes),
contemplating all the correlations that may be stronger than quantum mechanics
in exhibiting nonlocal behavior, yet weak enough to prohibit instantaneous
signaling, we characterize which of them exhibit \emph{classical}

this fact, which is that every problem in the complexity class QMA has a

  Our QMA proof system is sound against arbitrary quantum provers, but only
requires an honest prover to perform polynomial-time quantum computations,
provided that it holds a quantum witness for a given instance of the QMA
problem under consideration. The proof system relies on a new variant of the
QMA-complete local Hamiltonian problem in which the local terms are described
by Clifford operations and standard basis measurements. We believe that the
QMA-completeness of this problem may have other uses in quantum complexity.

vector associated with a n-photon polarization state is unique, and its
Minkowski squared norm provides a direct way of quantifying entanglement
through n-concurrence. However, the quanti?cation of entanglement from DWF is
not straight forward. The DWF associated with a given quantum state is not
unique but depends on the way in which basis vectors are assigned to various
lines in the phase space. For a Hilbert space of dimension N, there exists N
N+1 such possible assignments. While a given DWF corresponds to a unique Stokes
vector, the converse is not true. In the present work, we show that, for each
particular assignment called a quantum net, there exist a unique Hadamard
matrix which relates the Stokes vector to the corresponding DWF. This method
provides an elegant and direct method of constructing the DWFs from the Stokes
vector for every possible choice of the quantum net. Using these results, we
derive the relationship between the Stokes vector of a spin-?ipped state and
the DWF. Finally, we also present a method to express the Minkowskian squared

quantum circuit is replaced by a circular representation which allows to select
the starting point and the direction in which gates are executed. The
representation supports all the circuits obtained after computing cyclic
permutations of an initial quantum gate list. Two circuits, where one has a
gate list which is a cyclic permutation of the other, will implement different
functions. The main question appears in the context of scalable quantum
computing, where multiple subcircuits are used for the construction of a larger
fault-tolerant one: can the same circular representation be used by multiple
subcircuits? The circular circuits are sufficient for constructing
computationally universal, fault-tolerant circuits formed entirely of qubit
initialisation, CNOT gates and qubit measurements. The main result of modelling
circular CNOT circuits is that a derived Boolean representation allows to
define a set of equations for $X$ and $Z$ stabiliser transformations. Through a
well defined set of steps it is possible to reduce the initial equations to a
set of stabiliser transformations given a series of cuts through the circular
circuit.

relaxation gives a contact-limited current; strong relaxation localizes
electrons, distorting their natural dynamics and reducing the current; and in

while in the central well the atomic cloud experiences a local breathing mode.
The dynamical behavior is investigated with varying driving frequency,
revealing a resonant-like behavior of the intra-well dynamics. An interaction
quench in the periodically driven lattice gives rise to admixtures of different
excitations in the outer wells, an enhanced breathing in the center and an
amplification of the tunneling dynamics. We observe then multiple resonances
between the inter- and intra-well dynamics at different quench amplitudes, with
the position of the resonances being tunable via the driving frequency. Our
results pave the way for future investigations on the use of combined driving
protocols in order to excite different inter- and intra-well modes and to
subsequently control them.

devoid of particles but still not completely empty. It is perhaps more
surprising that its definition depends on the geometry of the system and on the
trajectory of an observer through space-time. Along these lines we investigate
the case of an atom flying at constant velocity near a planar surface. Using
general concepts of statistical mechanics it is shown that the motion-modified
interaction with the electromagnetic vacuum is formally equivalent to the
interaction with a thermal field having an effective temperature determined by
the atom's velocity and distance from the surface. This result suggests new
ways to experimentally investigate the properties of the quantum vacuum in
non-equilibrium systems and effects such as quantum friction.

  operations</title><description>  The concept of classical $f$-divergences gives a unified framework to
construct and study measures of dissimilarity of probability distributions;
special cases include the relative entropy and the R\'enyi divergences. Various
quantum versions of this concept, and more narrowly, the concept of R\'enyi
divergences, have been introduced in the literature with applications in
quantum information theory; most notably Petz' quasi-entropies (standard
$f$-divergences), Matsumoto's maximal $f$-divergences, measured
$f$-divergences, and sandwiched and $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences.
  In this paper we give a systematic overview of the various concepts of
quantum $f$-divergences with a main focus on their monotonicity under quantum
operations, and the implications of the preservation of a quantum
$f$-divergence by a quantum operation. In particular, we compare the standard
and the maximal $f$-divergences regarding their ability to detect the
reversibility of quantum operations. We also show that these two quantum
$f$-divergences are strictly different for non-commuting operators unless $f$
is a polynomial, and obtain some analogous partial results for the relation
between the measured and the standard $f$-divergences.
  We also study the monotonicity of the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergences under
the special class of bistochastic maps that leave one of the arguments of the
R\'enyi divergence invariant, and determine domains of the parameters
$\alpha,z$ where monotonicity holds, and where the preservation of the
$\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergence implies the reversibility of the quantum
operation.

We find that, when a quantum system is interacting with such a non-thermal bath
far from thermal equilibrium, it is no longer proper to use any coarse-grained
Markovian description for the system, even when their coupling strength is

including that of a travelling Gaussian perturbation to the susceptibility of
an otherwise infinite homogeneous dielectric, motivated by recent experiments

problem and provides a quadratic speed-up over all possible classical search
algorithms. Quantum interference between computational paths has been posited
as a key resource behind this computational speed-up. However there is a limit
to this interference, at most pairs of paths can ever interact in a fundamental
way. Could more interference imply more computational power? Sorkin has defined
a hierarchy of possible interference behaviours---currently under experimental
investigation---where classical theory is at the first level of the hierarchy
and quantum theory belongs to the second. Informally, the order in the
hierarchy corresponds to the number of paths that have an irreducible
interaction in a multi-slit experiment. In this work, we consider how Grover's
speed-up depends on the order of interference in a theory. Surprisingly, we
show that the quadratic lower bound holds regardless of the order of
interference. Thus, at least from the point of view of the search problem,
post-quantum interference does not imply a computational speed-up over quantum

possibilities for understanding fundamental forms of matter. Here, we show that
trapped ions represent a promising platform in this context when simultaneously
exploiting internal pseudo-spins and external phonon vibrations. We illustrate
our ideas with two complementary proposals for simulating lattice-regularized
quantum electrodynamics (QED) in (1+1) space-time dimensions. The first scheme
replaces the gauge fields by local vibrations with a high occupation number. By
numerical finite-size scaling, we demonstrate that this model recovers Wilson's
lattice gauge theory in a controlled way. Its implementation can be scaled up
to tens of ions in an array of micro-traps. The second scheme represents the
gauge fields by spins 1/2, and thus simulates a quantum link model. As we show,
this allows the fermionic matter to be replaced by bosonic degrees of freedom,
permitting small-scale implementations in a linear Paul trap. Both schemes work
on energy scales significantly larger than typical decoherence rates in
experiments, thus enabling the investigation of phenomena such as string
breaking, Coleman's quantum phase transition, and false-vacuum decay. The
underlying ideas of the proposed analog simulation schemes may also be adapted
to other platforms, such as superconducting qubits.

quantum systems controlled by macroscopic or otherwise classical elements
external to the system-bath setup. We define the operations of such hybrid
devices as conditioned thermal operations (CTO), and their deviation from
thermal equilibrium as conditional athermality. We develop the resource theory
of conditional athermality, including its characterization, quantification, and

conditional athermality monotones, we find necessary and sufficient conditions

many-copy conversion. As an application, we derive the conditions for
probabilistic conversion of athermality, and find them to be analogous to

Field Theory</title><description>  In both quantum optics and cold atom physics, the behaviour of bosonic
photons and atoms is often treated using phase space methods, where mode
annihilation and creation operators are represented by c-number phase space
variables, with the density operator equivalent to a distribution function of
these variables. The anti-commutation rules for fermion annihilation, creation
operators suggests the possibility of using anti-commuting Grassmann variables
to represent these operators. However, in spite of the seminal work by Cahill
and Glauber and a few applications, the use of Grassmann phase space methods in
quantum - atom optics to treat fermionic systems is rather rare, though fermion
coherent states using Grassmann variables are widely used in particle physics.
  This paper presents a phase space theory for fermion systems based on
distribution functionals, which replace the density operator and involve
Grassmann fields representing anti-commuting fermion field annihilation,
creation operators. It is an extension of a previous phase space theory paper
for fermions (Paper I) based on separate modes, in which the density operator
is replaced by a distribution function depending on Grassmann phase space
variables which represent the mode annihilation and creation operators. This
further development of the theory is important for the situation when large
numbers of fermions are involved, resulting in too many modes to treat
separately. Here Grassmann fields, distribution functionals, functional
Fokker-Planck equations and Ito stochastic field equations are involved.
Typical applications to a trapped Fermi gas of interacting spin 1/2 fermionic
atoms and to multi-component Fermi gases with non-zero range interactions are
presented, showing that the Ito stochastic field equations are local in these
cases. Solutions for spin 1/2 fermions either free or in lattices are found.

&quot;causal model&quot; analogous to a local model). Since the only processes known to
be physically implementable have a causal model, it is tempting to conjecture
that having a causal model singles out physically realizable processes. Here we
provide evidence against this conjecture. We show for the first time that
bipartite causally nonseparable processes with a causal model exist, and argue
that they have no clear physical interpretation. We also provide an algorithm

Specializing to Lindblad-dynamics, we identify the corresponding kinetic

Reciprocity relations follow from symmetries with respect to time reversal. The
kinetic coefficients can be split into a classical and a quantum contribution
subject to a new constraint, which follows from a natural detailed balance
condition. This constraint implies universal bounds on efficiency and power of
quantum heat engines. In particular, we show that Carnot efficiency can not be
reached whenever quantum coherence effects are present, i.e., when the
Hamiltonian used for work extraction does not commute with the bare system
Hamiltonian. For illustration, we specialize our universal results to a driven

optical signal processing based on nonlinear optics. A new set of challenges
presents itself when processing quantum signals, including noise suppression

spectrum of the photon pair has strongly negative frequency correlations before
the time lens and strongly positive correlations afterwards, verifying that the

of quantum simulation technology has enabled the manipulation of qubits.
Accordingly, chirality can be realized intentionally rather than passively
observed. Here we theoretically provide simple methods to create a chiral spin
state in a spin-1/2 qubit system on a square lattice. First, we show that
switching ON/OFF the Heisenberg and $XY$ interactions produces the chiral
interaction directly in the effective Hamiltonian without controlling local
fields. Moreover, when initial states of spin-qubits are appropriately
prepared, we prove that the chirality with desirable phase is dynamically
obtained. Finally, even for the case where switching ON/OFF the interactions is
infeasible and the interactions are always-on, we show that, by preparing an
asymmetric initial qubit state, the chirality whose phase is $\pi/2$ is
dynamically generated.

we demonstrate the universality of a purely dissipative quantum Markov process

magnetic field as well as a coupling to a thermal bath to investigate the
susceptibility of the engineered dissipative process to unitary and nonunitary
perturbations. We establish the nonequilibrium steady-state phase diagram as a

of particles $N$, we identify a parameter region in which the engineered
symmetrizing dissipative process performs robustly, while in the thermodynamic
limit $N\rightarrow \infty$, the coupling to the thermal bath destroys any

thermodynamics of computation sets the ultimate physical bounds on heat
generation. A lower bound is set by the Landauer Limit, at which computation
becomes thermodynamically reversible. For classical computation there is no
physical principle which prevents this limit being reached, and approaches to
it are already being experimentally tested. In this paper we show that for
quantum computation there is an unavoidable excess heat generation that renders
it inherently thermodynamically irreversible. The Landauer Limit cannot, in

The cavity is thus emptied as all transmission probabilities of the quantum
point contact approach one or zero. Two-photon processes are identified at
higher coupling, and pair absorption dominates over pair emission for all bias

or local realistic models of quantum theory (QT), including quantum field
theory (QFT), are theoretically possible and practically feasible in light of
the present state of these theories. Quantum physicists consider Bells famous
inequality and its violation in experiments to be a strong indication that
local realistic or local causal models of QT are not possible and that quantum
theory as a whole is therefore not a local realistic or local causal theory.
Based on a proposed definition of a &quot;formal causal model&quot; for a theory of
physics (such as QT), this paper investigates the possibility of having a local
causal model for QT. Areas of QT are identified in which the construction of a
causal model is impeded because of deficiencies in the state of the respective
theory. It is shown that the removal of the deficiencies can be achieved by the
provision of a causal model. Whereas the construction of a causal model of QT,
including QFT, appears to be feasible after the removal of certain
deficiencies, the construction of a local (causal) model does not appear to be
possible. As a consequence of the conclusion that local (causal) models of
QT/QFT are not possible, if a strong interpretation of locality is assumed, a
locality model is proposed in which the non-localities are confined to &quot;quantum
objects&quot;.

observables in isolated integrable quantum systems after equilibration. Since
then, the GGE has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool to predict the
outcome of the relaxation dynamics of few-body observables in a variety of
integrable models, a process we call generalized thermalization. This review
discusses several fundamental aspects of the GGE and generalized thermalization
in integrable systems. In particular, we focus on questions such as: which
observables equilibrate to the GGE predictions and who should play the role of
the bath; what conserved quantities can be used to construct the GGE; what are
the differences between generalized thermalization in noninteracting systems
and in interacting systems mappable to noninteracting ones; why is it that the
GGE works when traditional ensembles of statistical mechanics fail. Despite a
lot of interest in these questions in recent years, no definite answers have
been given. We review results for the XX model and for the transverse field
Ising model. For the latter model, we also report original results and show
that the GGE describes spin-spin correlations over the entire system. This
makes apparent that there is no need to trace out a part of the system in real
space for equilibration to occur and for the GGE to apply. In the past, a
spectral decomposition of the weights of various ensembles revealed that
generalized eigenstate thermalization occurs in the XX model (hard-core
bosons). Namely, that eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with similar distributions
of conserved quantities have similar expectation values of few-spin
observables. Here we show that generalized eigenstate thermalization also
occurs in the transverse field Ising model.

realize the stabilisation of quantum systems, and a powerful complement to
attempts to design-in passive robustness. However, applications to date have
largely been limited by the challenge that projective measurement of quantum
devices causes the collapse of quantum superposition states. As a result
significant tradeoffs have been mandated in applying the concept of feedback,
and experiments have relied on open-loop control, weak measurements, access to
ancilla states, or largely sacrificing quantum coherence in the controlled
system. In this work we use techniques from control theory and machine learning
to enable the real-time feedback suppression of semiclassical decoherence in a
qubit when access to measurements is limited. Using a time-series of
measurements of a qubit's phase we are able to predict future stochastic
evolution without requiring a deterministic model of qubit evolution. We
demonstrate this capability by preemptively stabilising predicted qubit
dephasing in two experiments. First, we realise periods of stabilised qubit
operation during which projective measurements are not performed via a
non-destructive time-division multiplexed approach. Second, we implement
predictive feedback in a periodic loop where the presence of long
free-evolution periods normally causes decorrelation between measurement
outcomes and the qubit state at the time of control actuation. Both experiments
demonstrate quantitative improvements in qubit phase stability relative to
&quot;traditional&quot; measurement-based feedback approaches, including enhanced
long-term qubit phase stabilisation. Our approach is extremely simple and
applicable to any qubit with the ability to perform projective measurement,
requiring no hardware modifications, alternate measurement strategies, or
access to exotic ancilla states.

its diagonalization in the two-level system basis, numerical spectra and its

also show that the particular case of degenerate field frequencies and balanced
couplings allows us to cast the model as two parity deformed oscillators in any

applications, in particular in quantum information processing and reliable
diagnostics are needed to quantify them. To that purpose, we have
experimentally validated Dubin's model for very long ion chains [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 71, 2753 (1993)]. This diagnostic allows to precisely determine the
number of trapped ion with an accuracy of almost 1\% without counting them, by
measuring the ion-ion distance of the innermost particles, as well as the
trapping potential along the ion chain direction. In our experiment, based on a
155 ion chain, the central 30 ions are measured to be equidistant to better
than 2\%, and we can determine the total number of trapped ions with a 4.5\%
uncertainty, completely dominated by a conservative estimation of the
experimental characterisation of the trap.

quasi-macroscopic system affect the violation of the Leggett--Garg inequality,
a test of macroscopic-realism based on temporal correlation functions. As a
specific example, we focus on an ensemble of qubits subject to collective and
individual noise. This generic model can describe a range of physical systems,
including atoms in cavities, electron or nuclear spins in NV centers in
diamond, erbium in Y$_2$SiO$_5$, bismuth impurities in silicon, or arrays of
superconducting circuits, to indicate but a few. Such large ensembles are
potentially more macroscopic than other systems that have been used so far for
testing the Leggett--Garg inequality, and open a route toward probing the
boundaries of quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales. We find that, because of
the non-trivial internal structure of such an ensemble, the behavior of
different measurement schemes, under the influence of noise, can be surprising.
We discuss which measurement schemes are optimal for flux qubits and NV
centers, and some of the technological constraints and difficulties for
observing such violations with present-day experiments.

with constant curvature are analyzed from several viewpoints. In a deformed
supersymmetric framework, the corresponding nonlinear potentials are shown to
exhibit a deformed shape invariance property. By using the point canonical
transformation method, the two deformed Schr\&quot;odinger equations are mapped onto
conventional ones corresponding to some shape-invariant potentials, whose
rational extensions are well known. The inverse point canonical transformations
then provide some rational extensions of the oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb

potential in a hyperbolic space are studied in detail and their extensions are
proved to be consistent with already known ones in Euclidean space. The
partnership between nonextended and extended potentials is interpreted in a

energy bands; similar to their electronic counterparts, this leads to the
formation of chiral edge modes which can be used to transmit light in a manner
that is protected against back-scattering. While it is understood how classical
signals can propagate under these conditions, it is an outstanding important
question how the quantum vacuum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field get
modified in the presence of a topological band structure. We address this
challenge by exploring a setting where a non-zero topological invariant
guarantees the presence of a parametrically-unstable chiral edge mode in a
system with boundaries, even though there are no bulk-mode instabilities. We
show that one can exploit this to realize a topologically protected,
quantum-limited travelling-wave parametric amplifier. The device is naturally
protected both against internal losses and back-scattering; the latter feature
is in stark contrast to standard travelling wave amplifiers. This adds a new
example to the list of potential quantum devices that profit from topological

&quot;natural&quot; Hamiltonian cellular automata, which are based entirely on

This results in &quot;deformed&quot; quantum mechanical models with a finite discreteness

Presently, we show, in particular, how such automata can form &quot;multipartite&quot;

Consequently, the Superposition Principle is fully operative already on the

  infinite-range interaction: localization, dynamics, and bifurcation</title><description>  Excited state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) are generalizations of
quantum phase transitions (QPTs) to excited levels. They are associated with
local divergences in the density of states. Here, we investigate how the
presence of an ESQPT can be detected from the analysis of the elements of the
Hamiltonian matrix, the structure of the eigenstates, the onset of bifurcation,
and the speed of the system evolution. Our findings are illustrated for a
Hamiltonian with infinite-range Ising interaction in a transverse field. This
is a version of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model and the limiting case of
the one-dimensional spin-1/2 systems with tunable interactions realized with
ion traps. The Hamiltonian has a U(2) algebraic structure and shows a second
order QPT between the U(1) and the SO(2) dynamical symmetries. These
subalgebras represent, respectively, the transverse field (linear part of the
Hamiltonian) and the Ising interaction (nonlinear part of the Hamiltonian). We
show that the eigenstates with energies very close to the ESQPT critical point
are very localized in the U(1) ground state. As a consequence, the evolution of
this state is extremely slow, despite having high energy in the LMG
Hamiltonian. From these studies, we uncover similarities between the LMG and
the noninteracting XX models. We also argue that the bifurcation phenomenon
found in the LMG Hamiltonian occurs not only at a critical value of the control
parameter, but also at a critical energy, namely the energy of the ESQPT.

two-atom cavity system caused by external excitation phase. In the proposed
system, two identical atoms (with different positions in the optical cavity)
are firstly prepared into a timed state by an external single photon field.
During the excitation, the atoms grasp different phases which depend on the
spatial positions of the atoms in the cavity. Due to strong resonant
interaction between two atoms and optical cavity mode the absorbed input photon
can be efficiently transferred from the atoms to the resonant cavity mode. We
show that the quantum transfer is highly sensitive to the external excitation
phases of atoms and it leads to quantum interference effects on the cavity mode
excitation. Besides, the quantum transfer is also influenced by the
dipole-dipole interaction dependent to the atomic distance. In this system the
atomic positions also determine the coupling constants between atoms and cavity
mode which causes additional interference effects to the photon exchange
between atoms and cavity. Based on the characteristics of excitation phase we
find that it is a feasible scheme to generate long-lived dark state and it
could be useful for storage and manipulation of single photon fields by
controlling the excitation phase.

repetition theorem was known. We prove that the entangled value of a two-player
game $G$ repeated $n$ times in parallel is at most $c_G n^{-1/4} \log n$ for a

entanglement and state purity, is important from both fundamental and practical
viewpoints. Yet, this issue remains little explored in dynamical contexts for
open quantum systems. We address this problem by studying the dynamics of
entanglement and purity for two-qubit systems using paradigmatic models of
radiation-matter interaction, with a qubit being isolated from the environment
(spectator configuration). We show the effects of the corresponding local
quantum channels on an initial two-qubit pure entangled state in the
concurrence-purity diagram and find the conditions which enable dynamical
closed formulas of concurrence, used to quantify entanglement, as a function of
purity. We finally discuss the usefulness of these relations in assessing
entanglement and purity thresholds which allow noisy quantum teleportation. Our
results provide new insights about how different properties of composite open
quantum systems behave and relate each other during quantum evolutions.

which are not positive, and hence not physically acceptable. How do we ensure
that at all stages of reconstruction, we keep the density matrix positive and

measurements. In physics, such measurements occur at intermediate stages of a
complex measurement procedure, with the final measurement result being
operationally testable. Since the mathematical structure of Quantum Decision
Theory has been developed in analogy with the theory of quantum measurements,
the inconclusive quantum measurements correspond, in Quantum Decision Theory,
to intermediate stages of decision making in the process of taking decisions
under uncertainty. The general form of the quantum probability for a composite
event is the sum of a utility factor, describing a rational evaluation of the
considered prospect, and of an attraction factor, characterizing irrational,
subconscious attitudes of the decision maker. Despite the involved
irrationality, the probability of prospects can be evaluated. This is
equivalent to the possibility of calculating quantum probabilities without
specifying hidden variables. We formulate a general way of evaluation, based on
the use of non-informative priors. As an example, we suggest the explanation of
the decoy effect. Our quantitative predictions are in very good agreement with
experimental data.

we consider the transverse-field XY model and a dual model with 3-spin
interactions. The former has a ferromagnetic and a paramagnetic phase, while
the latter features, in addition, a symmetry protected topological phase. Using
the method of third quantization, we calculate the non-equilibrium steady-state
of the open spin chains for arbitrary system sizes and temperatures. We find
that the bi-local correlation function of the spins at both ends of the chain
provides a sensitive measure for both symmetry-breaking and topological phase
transitions of the systems, but no universal means to distinguish between the
two types of transitions. Both models have equivalent representations in terms
of free Majorana fermions, which host zero, one and two topological Majorana
end modes in the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, and symmetry protected
topological phases, respectively. The correlation function we study retains its
bi-local character in the fermionic representation, so that our results are
equally applicable to the fermionic models in their own right. We propose a
photonic realization of the dissipative transverse-field XY model in a tunable

as applied to finite systems of binary random variables. The logic and
principles of the original theory remain unchanged, but the definition of
contextuality of a system of random variables is now based on multimaximal
rather than maximal couplings of the variables that measure the same property
in different contexts: a system is considered noncontextual if these couplings
are compatible with the distributions of the random variables sharing contexts.
A multimaximal coupling is one that is a maximal coupling of any subset of the
random variables being coupled. Arguments are presented for why this modified
theory is a superior generalization of the traditional understanding of
contextuality in quantum mechanics. The modified theory coincides with the
previous version in the important case of cyclic systems, which include the
systems whose contextuality was most intensively studied in quantum physics and
behavioral sciences.

theory especially applicable to behavioral systems, where violations of
selective influences are ubiquitous. For cyclic systems with binary random
variables, CbD provides necessary and sufficient conditions for
noncontextuality, and these conditions are known to be breached in certain
quantum systems. We apply the theory of cyclic systems to a psychophysical
double-detection experiment, in which observers were asked to determine
presence or absence of a signal property in each of two simultaneously
presented stimuli. The results, as in all other behavioral and social systems
previous analyzed, indicate lack of contextuality. The role of context in
double-detection is confined to lack of selectiveness: the distribution of
responses to one of the stimuli is influenced by the state of the other
stimulus.

systems with binary outcomes. In quantum physics, the cyclic systems of ranks
$n=$ 5, 4, and 3 are known as systems of Klyachko-type, EPR-Bell-type, and
Leggett-Garg-type, respectively. In earlier publications, we examined data
collected in various behavioral and social scenarios, from polls of public
opinion to our own experiments with psychophysical matching. No evidence of
contextuality was found in these data sets. However, those studies were
confined to cyclic systems of lower ranks ($n\leq4$). In this paper,
contextuality of higher ranks ($n=6,8$) was tested on our data with
psychophysical matching, and again, no contextuality was found. This may
indicate that many if not all of the seemingly contextual effects observed in
behavioral sciences are merely violations of consistent connectedness

fixed, the highest precision is obtained by preparing the optimal probe states
and performing optimal measurements. However in many practical experimental
settings, additional controls are usually available to alter the dynamics for
further improvement of the precision limit. Here we employ optimal control
methods, in particular the GRAPE, to design optimal controls for the
improvement of the precision limit. We show that much higher precision can be

Furthermore, by building a superadiabatic formalism on top of this protocol, we

  operator in the time dependent modelling of quantum transport</title><description>  In this work, the use of the Boltzmann collision operator for dissipative
quantum transport is analyzed. Its mathematical role on the description of the
time-evolution of the density matrix during a collision can be understood as
processes of adding and subtracting states. We show that unphysical results can
be present in quantum simulations when the old states (that built the density
matrix associated to an open system before the collision) are different from
the additional states generated by the Boltzmann collision operator. As a
consequence of the Fermi Golden rule, the new generated sates are usually
eigenstates of the momentum or kinetic energy. Then, the different
time-evolutions of old and new states involved in a collision process can
originate negative values of the charge density, even longer after the
collision. This unphysical feature disappears when the Boltzmann collision
operator generates states that were already present in the density matrix of
the quantum system before the collision. Following these ideas, in this paper,
we introduce an algorithm that models phonon-electron interactions through the
Boltzmann collision operator without negative values of the charge density. The
model only requires the exact knowledge, at all times, of the states that build
the density matrix of the open system.

subset of a set, so there is a logic of partitions dual to Boole's logic of
subsets (Boolean logic is usually mis-specified as &quot;propositional&quot; logic). The
notion of an element of a subset has as its dual the notion of a distinction of
a partition (a pair of elements in different blocks). Boole developed finite
logical probability as the normalized counting measure on elements of subsets
so there is a dual concept of logical entropy which is the normalized counting
measure on distinctions of partitions. Thus the logical notion of information
is a measure of distinctions. Classical logical entropy naturally extends to
the notion of quantum logical entropy which provides a more natural and
informative alternative to the usual Von Neumann entropy in quantum information
theory. The quantum logical entropy of a post-measurement density matrix has
the simple interpretation as the probability that two independent measurements
of the same state using the same observable will have different results. The
main result of the paper is that the increase in quantum logical entropy due to
a projective measurement of a pure state is the sum of the absolute squares of
the off-diagonal entries (&quot;coherences&quot;) of the pure state density matrix that
are zeroed (&quot;decohered&quot;) by the measurement, i.e., the measure of the
distinctions (&quot;decoherences&quot;) created by the measurement.

B-H machine clones state of an arbitrary single qubit in optimal manner and
hence it is universal. Generalizing this machine for two-qubit system is
straightforward, but this procedure does not preserve quantum correlation
existing in bipartite state in optimal manner and also, during this procedure,
this machine loses its universality and becomes a state-dependent cloning
machine. In this paper we propose an optimal universal local quantum state

of two aspects of quantum correlations, i.e., quantum entanglement and quantum

and from an information-theoretic perspective. The results show that although
quantum correlation is in general very fragile during broadcasting procedure,
quantum discord is broadcasted more robustly than quantum entanglement.

generic interaction Hamiltonian among the microscopic constituents of a
macroscopic system which would give rise to equilibration of the system. One
tries to evade this problem by incorporating the so-called $H-theorem$,
according to which, the (macroscopic) system arrives at equilibrium when its
entropy becomes maximum over all the accessible micro states. This approach has
become quite useful for thermodynamic calculations using the (thermodynamic)
equilibrium states of the system. Nevertheless, the original problem has still
not been resolved. In the context of resolving this problem it is important to
check the validity of thermodynamic concepts -- known to be valid for
macroscopic systems -- in the microscopic world. Quantum thermodynamics is an
effort in that direction. As a toy model towards this effort, we look here at
the process of thermalization of a two-level quantum system under the action of
a Markovian master equation corresponding to memory-less action of a heat bath,
kept at certain temperature. A two-qubit interaction Hamiltonian ($H_{th}$,
say) is then designed -- with a single-qubit mixed state as the initial state
of the bath -- which gives rise to thermalization of the system qubit in the
infinite time limit. We then look at the question of equilibration by taking
the simplest case of a two-qubit system $A + B$, under some interaction
Hamiltonian $H_{int}$ (which is of the form of $H_{th}$) with the individual
qubits being under the action of separate heat baths of temperatures $T_A$, and
$T_B$. Different equilibrium phases of the two-qubit system are shown to appear
-- both the qubits or one of them get cooled down.

reexamined by applying the von Neumann theory of self--adjoint extensions.
Contrary to previous studies where the interaction between the spin and the
line of charge is neglected, here we consider its effects. This interaction
gives rise to a point interaction: $\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{E}=
(2\mu\lambda/\hbar c)\delta(r)/r$. Due to the presence of the Dirac delta
function, by applying an appropriated boundary condition provided by the theory
of self--adjoint extensions, irregular solutions for the Hamiltonian are
allowed. We address the scattering problem obtaining the phase shift, S-matrix

something similar wait to be found. This invites us to search for explicit

that many quantum measurement devices rely on atoms absorbing photons, these

  We propose experiments designed to test whether the emission and absorption

atom is found, in certain situations, to absorb completely the photon, this
would mean that in those situations the atom cannot exist or at least it cannot
be stable as a superposition of states in which it absorbed the photon and it
did not absorb it. Then we will have a new possibility to resolve the problem
of measurement, and that of the emergence of classicality. A negative result

the geometric momentum and potential are simultaneously admissible within the
Dirac canonical quantization scheme for constrained motion. In our approach,
not the full scheme but the symmetries indicated by classical brackets
[x,H]_{D} and [p,H]_{D} in addition to the fundamental ones [x,x]_{D},
[x,p]_{D} and [p,p]_{D} are utilized, where the subscript D stands for the
Dirac bracket. The generalized centripetal force law p=[p,H]_{D} for particle
on the 2D surface play the key role, and there is no simple relationship
between the force on a point of the surface and its curvatures of the point, in
sharp contrast to the motion on a curve.

  wave trajectories</title><description>  Standard Quantum Mechanics (SQM) is the most widely accepted &quot;route&quot; starting
from the common ground provided by de Broglie's and Schroedinger's discovery of
matter waves and of their eigen-functions and eigen-values. Another &quot;route&quot; is
offered by Bohm's Mechanics, able to reproduce the same results of SQM, while
interpreting the streamlines of probability current density as a set of
(variously interpreted) &quot;quantum trajectories&quot;. We exploit here a somewhat
different &quot;route&quot;, based on the fact that the stationary Schroedinger equation
(as well as any other Helmholtz-like equation) may be treated in terms of exact
point-particle trajectories, coupled and guided by a stationary, energy
dependent function, which we call &quot;Wave Potential&quot;, acting normally to the
relevant particle momentum and preserving, therefore, the particle energy: a
property which cannot be shared by the time-dependent &quot;Quantum Potential&quot; of
the Bohmian theory, involving the entire spectrum of eigen-energies. This basic
property turns out, indeed, to allow the numerical computation of the particle
trajectories in stationary external force fields, and to show that all
diffractive processes consist of energy-preserving exchanges, mediated by the
Wave Potential, between the longitudinal and transverse momentum components of
each single particle. We compute and discuss the trajectories of particles
moving, under the guiding action of the Wave Potential, in a number of
different external stationary force-fields, such as a constant field and the
ones due to a potential barrier, a potential step and a focalizing potential,
respectively. The very existence of these exact solutions appears to circumvent
the general character of the Uncertainty Principle.

continuous optical detection of the oscillator position. In the parameter
regime relevant to ground state cooling, the optical back-action and
imprecision noise set the bottleneck of achievable cooling and must be
carefully balanced. This can be achieved by adapting the phase of the local
oscillator in the homodyne detection realizing a so-called variational

particularly relevant when the measurement and feedback processes happen to be

analyzed the spatial dependence of the atomic spontaneous emission by Markovian
approximation. The role of retardation is studied for the atomic transition
frequency far away from the cutoff frequencies. The atom-mirror distance
introduces different phases and retardation times into the dynamics of the atom
interacting resonantly with the corresponding transverse modes. It is found
that the upper state population decreases from its initial as long as the
atom-mirror distance does not vanish, and is lowered and lowered when more and
more transverse modes are resonant with the atom. The atomic spontaneous
emission can be either suppressed or enhanced by adjusting the atomic location
for short retardation time. There are partial revivals and collapses due to the
photon reabsorbed and re-emitted by the atom for long retardation time.

  dimensional spin chain</title><description>  We consider a generalized central spin model, consisting of two central
qubits and an environmental spin chain (with periodic boundary condition) to
which these central qubits are locally and weakly connected either at the same
site or at two different sites separated by a distance $d$. Our purpose is to
study the subsequent temporal generation of entanglement, quantified by
concurrence, when initially the qubits are in an unentangled state. In the
equilibrium situation, we show that the concurrence survives for a larger value
of $d$ when the environmental spin chain is critical. Importantly, a common
feature observed both in the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium situations
while the latter is created by a sudden but global change of the environmental
transverse field, is that the two qubits become maximally entangled for the
critical quenching. Following a non-equilibrium evolution of the spin chain,
our study for $d\neq 0$, indicates that there exists a threshold time above
which concurrence attains a finite value. Additionally, we show that the number
of independent decohering channels (DCs) is determined by $d$ as well as the
local difference of the transverse field of the two underlying Hamiltonians
governing the time evolution. The qualitatively similar behavior displayed by
the concurrence for critical and off-critical quenches, as reported here, is
characterized by analyzing the non-equilibrium evolution of these channels. The
concurrence is maximum when the decoherence factor or the echo associated with
the most rapidly DC decays to zero; on the contrary, the condition when the
concurrence vanishes is determined non-trivially by the associated decay of one
of the intermediate DCs. Analyzing the reduced density of a single qubit, we
also explain the observation that the dephasing rate is always slower than the
unentanglement rate.

between arbitrary pairs of parties in the network and facilitate also
multi-user applications. To address this challenge, we propose a 2D quantum

  Vertex Model</title><description>  We construct a planar vertex model that encodes the result of a universal
reversible classical computation in its ground state. The approach involves
Boolean variables (spins) placed on links of a two-dimensional lattice, with
vertices representing logic gates. Large short-ranged interactions between at
most two spins implement the operation of each gate. The lattice is anisotropic
with one direction corresponding to &quot;computational&quot; time, and with transverse
boundaries storing the computation's input and output. Our approach tackles
both fixed input computations that proceed forward in computational time, but
also, more interestingly, problems in which only partial information about both
inputs and outputs is known. In that case, reaching the ground state requires
flow of information both forwards and backwards across the lattice, processes
that are naturally built into our mapping of reversible computations into the
vertex model. This allows us to tackle a subclass of the Circuit Satisfiability
(CSAT) problem and to solve factoring problems by using multiplication circuits
with polynomial depth. While we show that the model displays no finite
temperature phase transitions, independent of circuit, the computational
complexity is encoded in the scaling of the relaxation rate into the ground
state with the system size. To explore faster relaxation routes, we construct
an explicit mapping of the vertex model into the Chimera architecture of the
D-Wave machine, initiating a novel approach to reversible classical computation
based on state-of-the-art implementations of quantum annealing.

zeros at locations other than the nodes of the eigenstates that comprise them.
It is shown that if an infinite potential barrier is suddenly raised at some or
all of these zeros, the well can be split into multiple adjacent infinite
square wells without affecting the wavefunction. This effects a change of the
energy eigenbasis of the state to a basis that does not commute with the
original, and a subsequent measurement of the energy now reveals a completely
different spectrum, which we call the {interference energy spectrum} of the
state. This name is appropriate because the same splitting procedure applied at
the stationary nodes of any eigenstate does not change the measurable energy of
the state. Of particular interest, this procedure can result in measurable
energies that are greater than the energy of the highest mode in the original
superposition, raising questions about the conservation of energy akin to those
that have been raised in the study of superoscillations. An analytic derivation
is given for the interference spectrum of a given wavefunction $\Psi(x,t)$ with
$N$ known zeros located at points $s_i = (x_i, t_i)$. Numerical simulations
were used to verify that a barrier can be rapidly raised at a zero of the
wavefunction without significantly affecting it. The interpretation of this
result with respect to the conservation of energy and the energy-time
uncertainty relation is discussed, and the idea of alternate energy eigenbases
is fleshed out. The question of whether or not a preferred discrete energy
spectrum is an inherent feature of a particle's quantum state is examined.

The spin-mixing dynamics has two characteristic frequencies in the limit of

This thesis comes from the latter perspective, aiming to find new, simpler ways
in which components of a quantum computer could be built. We first search for
ways to create quantum gates, the primitive building blocks of a quantum
computer. We find a novel, low-control way of performing a two-qubit gate on
qubits encoded in a decoherence-free subspace, making use of many-body
interactions that may already be present. This includes an analysis of the
effect of control errors and magnetic field fluctuations on the gate. We then
present novel ways to create three-qubit Toffoli and Fredkin gates in a single

gates could perform, for quantum or classical computation, using
state-of-the-art ion trap and silicon donor technology. We then focus on a very

measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) and holonomic quantum computation,
showing that all MBQC patterns with a property called \emph{gflow} can be
converted into a holonomic computation. The manifestation of the properties of
MBQC in this adiabatically driven model is then explored. Finally, we
investigate ways in which quantum information can be communicated between

1D Wigner crystals as a quantum channel is analysed, as well as schemes using
ideal uniform spin chains with next-neighbour interactions, and edge-locking

the equation of forced oscillations in modelling the Lorentz atom. The electric
polarizability, which many authors &quot;derived&quot; from AL equation in recent years,
is found to violate Kramers-Kronig relations rendering obsolete the extracted

  nuclear spins</title><description>  Methods for achieving quantum control and detection of individual nuclear
spins by single electrons of solid-state defects play a central role for
quantum information processing and nano-scale nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).
However, with standard techniques, no more than 8 nuclear spins have been
resolved. Here we develop a method that improves significantly the ability to
spectrally resolve nuclear spins and demonstrate its capabilities with detailed
numerical simulations by using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre as model system.
Based on delayed entanglement control, a technique combining microwave and
radio-frequency (rf) fields, nuclei with resonances in a broad frequency band
can be unambiguously and individually addressed by the sensor electron.
Additionally the spectral resolution can extend beyond the electron spin
relaxation time by using a long-lived qubit memory. Our method greatly
increases the number of useful register qubits accessible to a defect centre
and improves the signals of nano-scale NMR.

  laser</title><description>  Coherent quantum-state manipulation of trapped ions using classical laser
fields is a trademark of modern quantum technologies. In this work, we study
aspects of work statistics and irreversibility in a single trapped ion due to
sudden interaction with the impinging laser. This is clearly an
out-of-equilibrium process where work is performed through illumination of an
ion by the laser. Starting with the explicit evaluation of the first moments of
the work distribution, we proceed to a careful analysis of irreversibility as
quantified by the nonequilibrium lag. The treatment employed here is not
restricted to the Lamb-Dicke limit, what allows us to investigate the interplay
between nonlinearities and irreversibility. We show, for instance, that in the
resolved carrier and sideband regimes, variation of the Lamb-Dicke parameter
may cause a non-monotonic behavior of the irreversibility indicator.
Counterintuitively, we find a working point where nonlinearity helps
reversibility, making the sudden quench of the Hamiltonian closer to what would
have been obtained quasistatically and isothermally.

$N$-type transition configuration in a two-mode nanofiber cavity with a
significant length (on the order of $20$ mm) and a moderate finesse (on the
order of 300) under the electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT)
conditions. In our model, the gate and probe fields are the quantum
nanofiber-cavity fields excited by weak classical light pulses, and the
parameters of the $D_2$ line of atomic cesium are used. We examine two
different switching schemes. The first scheme is based on the effect of the
presence of a photon in the gate mode on the EIT of the probe mode. The second
scheme is based on the use of EIT to store a photon of the gate mode in the
population of an appropriate atomic level, which leads to the reduction of the
transmission of the field in the probe mode. We investigate the dependencies of
the switching contrast on various parameters, such as the cavity length, the
mirror reflectivity, and the detunings and powers of the cavity driving field
pulses. For a nanofiber cavity with fiber radius of 250 nm, cavity length of 20
mm, and cavity finesse of 313 and a cesium atom at a distance of 200 nm from
the fiber surface, we numerically obtain a switching contrast on the order of
about 67% for the first scheme and of about 95% for the second scheme. These
switching operations require small mean numbers of photons in the nanofiber
cavity gate and probe modes.

distributed particles, and the quantification of created entanglement is a hard
problem. It corresponds to the concepts of entangling and assisted entangling
power when the input states are respectively product and arbitrary pure states.
We analytically derive them for Schmidt-rank-two bipartite unitary and some
complex bipartite permutation unitaries. In particular the entangling power of
permutation unitary of Schmidt rank three can only take one of two values:
$\log_2 9 - 16/9$ or $\log_2 3$ ebits. The entangling power, assisted
entangling power and disentangling power of $2\times d_B$ permutation unitaries
of Schmidt rank four are all $2$ ebits. These quantities are also derived for
generalized Clifford operators. We further show that any bipartite permutation
unitary of Schmidt rank greater than two has entangling power greater than
$1.223$ ebit. We construct the generalized CNOT gates whose assisted entangling
power reaches the maximum. We quantitatively compare the entangling power and
assisted entangling power for general bipartite unitaries, and their connection
to the disentangling power by proposing a probabilistic protocol for
implementing bipartite unitaries.

energy cost. Recently, Vaccaro and Barnett explored the role of multiple
conserved quantities in information erasure, and demonstrated that for energy
degenerate spin reservoirs, the cost of erasure is solely in terms of a minimum
amount of spin angular momentum and no energy. As opposed to the Landauer case,
this cost is associated with a discrete variable. We study here the discrete
fluctuations in this memory erasure protocol. We obtain the analogous Jarzynski
equality and also study the probability of violation of the Vaccaro-Barnett
bound when fluctuations are important. We find that the discrete nature of spin
angular momentum exchange is reflected as jumps in the probability of
violation. We further analyze the statistics in the two different regimes of
reservoir spin polarization, and expose a tradeoff between size of the
fluctuations and the cost of erasure. We also state the first laws of
thermodynamics for this particular erasure protocol. Our work opens up the
novel possibilities of heat engines based on information erasure scheme that do
not incur an energy cost.

well as the calculus they imply, are non-unique. The examples of
four-dimensional spaces, $\mathbb{R}_+^4$ and $(-L/2,L/2)^4$, are considered
where different types of arithmetic and calculus coexist simultaneously. In all
the examples there exists a non-Diophantine arithmetic that makes the space
globally Minkowskian, and thus the laws of physics are formulated in terms of
the corresponding calculus. However, when one switches to the `natural'
Diophantine arithmetic and calculus, the Minkowskian character of the space is
lost and what one effectively obtains is a Lorentzian manifold. I discuss in
more detail the problem of electromagnetic fields produced by a pointlike
charge. The solution has the standard form when expressed in terms of the
non-Diophantine formalism. When the `natural' formalsm is used, the same
solution looks as if the fields were created by a charge located in an
expanding universe, with nontrivially accelerating expansion. The effect is
clearly visible also in solutions of the Friedman equation with vanishing
cosmological constant. All of this suggests that phenomena attributed to dark
energy may be a manifestation of a miss-match between the arithmetic employed
in mathematical modeling, and the one occurring at the level of natural laws.
Arithmetic is as physical as geometry.

on the Drude-plasma issue that turns up when one considers thermal corrections
to the Casimir force. The problem is that the plasma model, although leaving
out dissipation in the material, apparently gives the best agreement with
recent experiments. We consider a dielectric plate separated from a dielectric
half-space by a vacuum gap, both media being similar. We consider the following
categories: (1) Making use of the statistical mechanical method developed by
H{\o}ye and Brevik (1998), implying that the quantized electromagnetic field is
replaced by interaction between dipole moments oscillating in harmonic
potentials, we first verify that the Casimir force is in agreement with the
Drude prediction. No use of Fresnel's reflection coefficients is made at this
stage. (2) Then turning to the field theoretical description implying use of
the reflection coefficients, we derive results in agreement with the forgoing
when first setting the frequency equal to zero, before letting the permittivity
becoming large. With the plasma relation the reflection coefficient for TE zero
frequency modes depend on the component of the wave vector parallel to the
surfaces and lies between 0 and 1. This contradicts basic electrostatic theory.
(3) Turning to high permeability magnetic materials the TE zero frequency mode
describes the static magnetic field in the same way as the TM zero frequency
modes describe the static electric fields in electrostatics. With the plasma
model magnetic fields, except for a small part, can not pass through metals.
i.e.~metals effectively become superconductors. However, recent experimental
results clearly favor the plasma model. We shortly discuss a possible
explanation for this apparent conflict with electrostatics.

of the topological particle content. An extrapolation method on cylinders has
been used frequently to measure the topological entanglement entropy. Here, we
show that a class of short-range entangled 2D states, when put on an infinite
cylinder of circumference $L$, exhibits the entanglement R\'enyi entropy of any
integer index $\alpha \ge 2$ that obeys $S_\alpha = a L - \gamma$ where $a,
\gamma &gt; 0 $. Under the extrapolation method, the subleading term $\gamma$
would be identified as the topological entanglement entropy, which is spurious.
A nonzero $\gamma$ is always present if the 2D state reduces to a certain
symmetry-protected topological 1D state, upon disentangling spins that are far
from the entanglement cut. The internal symmetry that stabilizes $\gamma &gt; 0$
is not necessarily a symmetry of the 2D state, but should be present after the
disentangling reduction. If the symmetry is absent, $\gamma$ decays
exponentially in $L$ with a characteristic length, termed as a replica
correlation length, which can be arbitrarily large compared to the two-point
correlation length of the 2D state. We propose a simple numerical procedure to
measure the replica correlation length through replica correlation functions.
We also calculate the replica correlation functions for representative wave
functions of abelian discrete gauge theories and the double semion theory in
2D, to show that they decay abruptly to zero. This supports a conjecture that
the replica correlation length being small implies that the subleading term
from the extrapolation method determines the total quantum dimension.

evidence that a single photon packet is capable of extracting work from a
single two-level system (TLS). More importantly, this effect is found for a
photon as it is spontaneously emitted, therefore carrying only heat away from
the emitter. This is the most elementary process in which heat is converted
into work, requiring not more than two off-resonance atoms for that purpose.
From a more practical point of view it is found that, surprisingly, work can be
extracted from a TLS in a completely passive initial state. The process is
cyclic in the sense that the TLS initial and final states are equal. The state
of the TLS remains passive throughout the interaction time with the
single-photon packet. The physical meaning of the work performed by the TLS is
found to be a dynamical change in the color of the photon during the reemission
process. All our predictions are, in principle, measurable within
state-of-the-art experiments.

  ebits</title><description>  Quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) in quantum communi- cation systems has
been known to exhibit improved performance with the use of error-free
entanglement bits (ebits). In practical situations, ebits inevitably su?er from
errors, and as a result, the error-correcting capability of the code is
diminished. Prior studies have proposed two di?erent schemes as a solu- tion.
One uses only one QECC to correct errors on the receiver's side (i.e., Bob) and
on the sender's side (i.e., Alice). The other uses di?erent QECCs on each side.
In this paper, we present a method to correct errors on both sides by using
single nonadditive Entanglement-assisted codeword stabilized quantum error
correcting code(EACWS QECC). We use the property that the number of e?ective
error patterns decreases as much as the number of ebits. This property results
in a greater number of logical codewords using the same number of physical
qubits.

Sorting
neutral particles according to their spin configuration has been shown in the
Stern-Gerlach experiment, but in the case of electrons, an argument based on
classical trajectories from Wolfgang Pauli concluded the unfeasibility of spin
separation. Here, we demonstrate in theory that the electron spin can be
separated by a spin-dependent diffraction in the Kapitza-Dirac effect using
circularly polarized, strong X-ray laser beams. Our method simultaneously
filters and polarizes the electron spin, in contrast to an implicit method by
measuring the electron cyclotron frequency in a Penning trap. Compared to prior

altering the initial electron spin configuration and our scenario does not
require grating elements. The effect presented here allows for the coherent and

a unique description. In quantum theory time is a parameter ordering the
succession of the probability amplitudes of a quantum system, while according
to relativity theory each system experiences in general a different proper
time, depending on the system's world line, due to time to time dilation. It is
therefore of fundamental interest to test the notion of time in the regime
where both quantum and relativistic effects play a role, for example, when
different amplitudes of a single quantum clock experience different magnitudes
of time dilation. Here we propose a realization of such an experiment with a
single electron in a Penning trap. The clock can be implemented in the
electronic spin precession and its time dilation then depends on the radial
(cyclotron) state of the electron. We show that coherent manipulation and
detection of the electron can be achieved already with present day technology.
A single electron in a Penning trap is a technologically ready platform where
the notion of time can be probed in a hitherto untested regime, where it
requires a relativistic as well as quantum description.

other is left undisturbed. The atmospheric turbulence is simulated by a single
phase screen based on the Kolmogorov theory of turbulence. The output after
turbulence is projected into a three-dimensional (qutrit) basis composed of
specific Laguerre-Gaussian modes. A full state tomography is performed to
determine the density matrix for each output quantum state. These density

of the negativity, as a function of the scintillation strength. Theoretically,
the entanglement is calculated using a single phase screen approximation. We

spin-statistics problem, i.e. to justify the utterly important \qo{Pauli
Exclusion Principle} but by the adoption of the complex standard relativistic
quantum field theory. In a recent paper (Ref. [1]) we presented a proof of the
spin-statistics problem in the nonrelativistic approximation on the basis of
the \qo{Conformal Quantum Geometrodynamics}. In the present paper, by the same
theory the proof of the Spin-Statistics Theorem is extended to the relativistic
domain in the general scenario of curved spacetime. The relativistic approach
allows to formulate a manifestly step-by-step Weyl gauge invariant theory and
to emphasize some fundamental aspects of group theory in the demonstration. No
relativistic quantum field operators are used and the particle exchange
properties are drawn from the conservation of the intrinsic helicity of
elementary particles. It is therefore this property, not considered in the
Standard Quantum Mechanics, which determines the correct spin-statistics
connection observed in Nature [1]. The present proof of the Spin-Statistics
Theorem is simpler than the one presented in Ref. [1], because it is based on
symmetry group considerations only, without having recourse to frames attached

a quantum system with a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, we first propose an
adaptive protocol where only $2d-1$ measurement outcomes are used to accomplish
the QST for $all$ pure states. This idea is then extended to study QPT for
unitary channels, where an adaptive unitary process tomography (AUPT) protocol
of $d^2+d-1$ measurement outcomes is constructed for any unitary channel. We
experimentally implement the AUPT protocol in a 2-qubit nuclear magnetic

we can design different additional Hamiltonians to replace the traditional

  Counterdiabatic driving</title><description>  A scheme for arbitrary quantum state engineering (QSE) in three-state systems
is proposed. First, starting from a set of complete orthogonal time-dependent
basis with undetermined coefficients, a time-dependent Hamiltonian is derived
via Counterdiabatic driving for the purpose of guiding the system to attain an
arbitrary target state at a predefined time. Then, on request of the assumed
target states, two single-mode driving protocols and a multi-mode driving
protocol are proposed as examples to discuss the validity of the QSE scheme.
The result of comparison between singlemode driving and multi-mode driving
shows that multi-mode driving seems to have a wider rang of application
prospect because it can drive the system to an arbitrary target from an
arbitrary initial state also at a predefined time even without the use of
microwave fields for the transition between the two ground states. Moreover, a
polynomial ansatz as the simplest example is used to fix the pulses. The result
shows that the pulses designed to implement the protocols are not hard to be
realized in practice. At the end, QSE in higher-dimensional systems is also
discussed in brief as generalization example of the QSE scheme.

systems by investigating the long-standing conjecture that the maximally
symmetry-breaking quantum ground states are the most classical ones
corresponding to a globally ordered phase. We make this argument quantitatively
precise by comparing different local and global indicators of classicality and
quantumness, respectively in symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving quantum
ground states. We first discuss how naively comparing local, pairwise
entanglement and discord apparently leads to the opposite conclusion. Indeed,
we show that in symmetry-preserving ground states the two-body entanglement
captures only a modest portion of the total two-body quantum correlations,
while, on the contrary, in maximally symmetry-breaking ground states it
contributes the largest amount to the total two-body quantum correlations. We
then put to test the conjecture by looking at the global, macroscopic
correlation properties of quantum ground states. We prove that the ground
states which realize the maximum breaking of the Hamiltonian symmetries,
associated to a globally ordered phase, are the only ones that: I) are always
locally convertible, i.e. can be obtained from all other ground states by only
applying LOCC transformations (local operations and classical communication),
while the reverse is never possible; II) minimize the monogamy inequality on
the globally shared, macroscopic bipartite entanglement.

instigated a surge of interest in non-equilibrium physics, including many-body
dynamics of trapped ultracold atoms and ions, near-field radiative heat
transfer, and quantum friction. Under most circumstances the complexity of such
non-equilibrium systems requires a number of approximations to make theoretical
descriptions tractable. In particular, it is often assumed that spatially
separated components of a system thermalize with their immediate surroundings,
although the global state of the system is out of equilibrium. This powerful
assumption reduces the complexity of non-equilibrium systems to the local
application of well-founded equilibrium concepts. While this technique appears
to be consistent for the description of some phenomena, we show that it fails
for quantum friction by underestimating by approximately $80 \%$ the magnitude
of the drag force. Our results show that the correlations among components of
driven, but steady-state, quantum systems invalidate the assumption of local
thermal equilibrium, calling for a critical reexamination of this approach for

which is valid for an arbitrary system-environment model in the weak
system-environment coupling regime. It is shown that the effective lifetime of
a quantum state that is subjected to repeated projective measurements depends
on the overlap of the spectral density of the environment and a generalized
`filter function' which in turn depends on the system state that is repeatedly
being prepared, the measurement interval, the system parameters, the
system-environment coupling, and the environment correlation function. This
general framework is then used to study explicitly the Zeno to anti-Zeno
crossover behavior for the spin-boson model where a single two-level system is
coupled to a bosonic environment. It is shown that our framework reproduces
results for the usual population decay case as well as for the pure dephasing
model, while at the same time allowing us to study the Zeno to anti-Zeno
transition when both decay and dephasing take place. These results are then
extended to many two-level systems coupled collectively to the bosonic

white-noised potentials trigger modulation instability for tunneling of the

Action Principle. They can be mapped reversibly to continuum models by applying
Sampling Theory. Thus, &quot;deformed&quot; quantum mechanical models with a finite
discreteness scale $l$ are obtained, which for $l\rightarrow 0$ reproduce
familiar continuum results. We have recently demonstrated that such automata
can form &quot;multipartite&quot; systems consistently with the tensor product structures
of nonrelativistic many-body quantum mechanics, while interacting and
maintaining the linear evolution. Consequently, the Superposition Principle
fully applies for such primitive discrete deterministic automata and their
composites and can produce the essential quantum effects of interference and
entanglement.

  quantum spin ladders</title><description>  We investigate the trends of genuine multipartite entanglement of
high-temperature superconducting states, usually described by doping the Mott
insulator. We begin by analyzing the ground states of a Hubbard model with
large onsite interactions obtained by exact diagonalization in regimes where
the superconducting phase is observed for relatively high doping. The ground
states are observed to be genuine multipartite entangled, with the maximum
value achieved close to the superconducting phase boundary. Subsequently, for
finite hole doping, the short-range resonating valence bond (RVB) state is
considered to be the ground state of the Hubbard model. We prove that doped RVB
ladder states are always genuine multipartite entangled. We then formulate an
analytical recursion method for the wave function, which allows us to
efficiently estimate the entanglement as well as other physical quantities in
large doped RVB ladders. The maximum genuine multipartite entanglement in these
RVB states is observed at doping corresponding to the superconducting phase of
the Hubbard model.

  Fokker-Planck Treatment</title><description>  Optically levitated nanoparticles have recently emerged as versatile
platforms for investigating macroscopic quantum mechanics and enabling
ultrasensitive metrology. In this article we theoretically consider two damping
regimes of an optically levitated nanoparticle cooled by cavityless parametric
feedback. Our treatment is based on a generalized Fokker-Planck equation
derived from the quantum master equation presented recently and shown to agree
very well with experiment [1]. For low damping, we find that the resulting
Wigner function yields the single-peaked oscillator position distribution and
recovers the appropriate energy distribution derived earlier using a classical
theory and verified experimentally [2]. For high damping, in contrast, we
predict a double-peaked position distribution, which we trace to an underlying
bistability induced by feedback. Unlike in cavity-based optomechanics,
stochastic processes play a major role in determining the bistable behavior. To
support our conclusions, we present analytical expressions as well as numerical
simulations using the truncated Wigner function approach. Our work opens up the
prospect of developing bistability-based devices, characterization of
phase-space dynamics, and investigation of the quantum-classical transition
using levitated nanoparticles.

  agents</title><description>  The basic equations of physics involve a time variable t and are invariant
under the transformation $t goes to -t$. This invariance at first sight appears
to impose time reversibility as a principle of physics, in conflict with
thermodynamics. But equations written on the blackboard are not the whole story
in physics. In prior work we sharpened a distinction obscured in today's
theoretical physics, the distinction between obtaining evidence from
experiments on the laboratory bench and explaining that evidence in
mathematical symbols on the blackboard. The sharp distinction rests on a proof
within the mathematics of quantum theory that no amount of evidence,
represented in quantum theory in terms of probabilities, can uniquely determine
its explanation in terms of wave functions and linear operators. Building on
the proof we show here a role in physics for unpredictable symbol-handling
agents acting both at the blackboard and at the workbench, communicating back
and forth by means of transmitted symbols. Because of their unpredictability,
symbol-handling agents introduce a heretofore overlooked source of
irreversibility into physics, even when the equations they write on the
blackboard are invariant under t goes to -t$. Widening the scope of
descriptions admissible to physics to include the agents and the symbols that
link theory to experiments opens up a new source of time-irreversibility in
physics.

state quantum phase transition (QPT) occurs in parallel with a singularity in
the energy spectrum. This corresponds to a local divergence in the density of
states that propagates to higher energies as the control parameter increases
beyond the ground state critical point. The analysis of the spectrum has been a
main tool for the detection of an ESQPT. Studies of the effects of this
transition on the system dynamics are more limited. Here, we extend our
previous works and show that the evolution of an initial state with energy
close to the ESQPT critical point may be extremely slow. This result is
surprising, because it may take place in systems with long-range interactions,
where the dynamics is usually expected to be very fast. A timely example is the
one-dimensional spin-1/2 model with infinite-range Ising interaction in a
transverse field, accessible to experiments with ion traps. Its Hamiltonian has
a U(2) algebraic structure. More generally, ESPQTs can occur in any U(v+1)
Hamiltonian that exhibits a QPT between its limiting U(v) and SO(v+1) dynamical
symmetries. In this work, we compare the results for v=1, 2, and 3. They
represent, respectively, the one-, two-, and three-dimensional limits of the
molecular vibron model.

displacement with this method can be significantly enhanced by the correlation
between the two photons, given the same optical mode. The improvement is
largest if the correlations between the photons are strong, and falls off as
the biphoton correlation weakens. More surprisingly, we find that the smallest
resolvable parameter of a simple split detector scales as the inverse of the
number of biphotons for small biphoton number (&quot;Heisenberg scaling&quot;), because
the Fisher information diverges as the parameter to be estimated decreases in
value. One usually sees this scaling only for systems with many entangled
degrees of freedom. We discuss the transition for the split-detection scheme to
the standard quantum limit scaling for imperfect correlations as the biphoton
number is increased. An analysis of an $N$-pixel detector is also given to
investigate the benefit of using a higher resolution detector. The physical
limit of these metrology schemes is determined by the uncertainty in the birth

Moreover, it is shown that the separability-entanglement boundary of a Werner

representation for the polarization tensor along the real frequency axis is
found. The approximate analytic expressions for the polarization tensor and for
the reflectivities of graphene are obtained in different frequency regions at
any temperature. We show that the nonzero mass-gap parameter has a profound

reflectivity of gapped graphene goes to zero with vanishing frequency. At
nonzero temperature the same reflectivities are equal to unity at zero
frequency. We also find the resonance behavior of the reflectivities of gapped
graphene at both zero and nonzero temperature at the border frequency
determined by the width of the gap. At nonzero temperature the reflectifities
of graphene drop to zero in the vicinity of some frequency smaller than the
border frequency. Our analytic results are accompanied with numerical
computations performed over a wide frequency region. The developed formalism

nonclassicality, which also has profound implications for quantum computation.
However, little is known about the minimal negativity that is necessary in
general quasiprobability representations. Here we focus on a natural class of
quasiprobability representations that is distinguished by simplicity and
economy. We introduce three measures of negativity concerning the
representations of quantum states, unitary transformations, and quantum

representations with minimal negativity, which are in one-to-one correspondence

through a three-particle interaction between one magnon and two photons whose
frequency difference is resonant with the magnon frequency, as in optomechanics
with two photons and a phonon. The large spin density of a transparent
ferromagnetic insulator (such as the ferrite yttrium iron garnet) in an optical

  It is shown, that if a modified form of valence bond theory is used instead

This is so because the molecular Hamiltonian only contains the Coulomb

valence bond theory the self-consistent field calculation can be avoided so
that the matrix elements are analytical functions of the nuclear coordinates.

if there exist $d\times d$ Hermitian positive semidefinite matrices
$\{P_i\}_{i=1}^n$ (for some $d\ge 1$) such that $X_{ij}= {\rm Tr}(P_iP_j),$ for
all $i,j \in \{ 1, \ldots, n \}$. The cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix is the
smallest $d\ge 1$ for which such a representation is possible. In this work we
initiate the study of the cpsd-rank which we motivate twofold. First, the
cpsd-rank is a natural non-commutative analogue of the completely positive rank
of a completely positive matrix. Second, we show that the cpsd-rank is
physically motivated as it can be used to upper and lower bound the size of a
quantum system needed to generate a quantum behavior.
  In this work we present several properties of the cpsd-rank. Unlike the
completely positive rank which is at most quadratic in the size of the matrix,
no general upper bound is known on the cpsd-rank of a cpsd matrix. In fact, we
show that the cpsd-rank can be exponential in terms of the size. Specifically,
for any $n\ge1,$ we construct a cpsd matrix of size $2n$ whose cpsd-rank is
$2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$. Our construction is based on Gram matrices of Lorentz
cone vectors, which we show are cpsd. The proof relies crucially on the
connection between the cpsd-rank and quantum behaviors. In particular, we use a
known lower bound on the size of matrix representations of extremal quantum
correlations which we apply to high-rank extreme points of the $n$-dimensional
elliptope.
  Lastly, we study cpsd-graphs, i.e., graphs $G$ with the property that every
doubly nonnegative matrix whose support is given by $G$ is cpsd. We show that a
graph is cpsd if and only if it has no odd cycle of length at least $5$ as a
subgraph. This coincides with the characterization of cp-graphs.

with local dimension $2^n$ ($n$ being the size of the overlapping regions of
plaquettes) equal to the bond dimension. We investigate the trade-off between
gains in efficiency due to this restriction against losses in fidelity. The
time-dependent variational principle formulated for these states is numerically
very stable. Moreover, it shows significant gains in efficiency compared to the
naively related matrix product states - the evolution or optimisation scales as
$2^{3n}$ for the correlator product states versus $2^{4n}$ for the unrestricted
matrix product state. However, much of this advantage is offset by a
significant reduction in fidelity. Correlator product states break the local
Hilbert space symmetry by the explicit selection of a local basis. We
investigate this dependence in detail and formulate the broad principles under
which correlator product states may be a useful tool. In particular, we find
that scaling with overlap/bond order may be more stable with correlator product
states allowing a more efficient extraction of critical exponents - we present

  interface step</title><description>  Recent experiments on silicon nanostructures have seen breakthroughs toward
scalable, long-lived quantum information processing. The valley degree of
freedom plays a fundamental role in these devices, and the two lowest-energy
electronic states of a silicon quantum dot can form a valley qubit. In this
work, we show that a single-atom high step at the silicon/barrier interface
induces a strong interaction of the qubit and in-plane electric fields, and
analyze the consequences of this enhanced interaction on the dynamics of the
qubit. The charge densities of the qubit states are deformed differently by the
interface step, allowing non-demolition qubit readout via valley-to-charge
conversion. A gate-induced in-plane electric field together with the interface
step enables fast control of the valley qubit via electrically driven valley
resonance. We calculate single- and two-qubit gate times, as well as relaxation
and dephasing times, and present predictions for the parameter range where the
gate times can be much shorter than the relaxation time and dephasing is
reduced.

  quantum lattice models</title><description>  Geometric entanglement(GE), as a measure of multipartite entanglement, has
been investigated as a universal tool to detect phase transitions in quantum
many-body lattice models. We outline a systematic method to compute GE for
two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body lattice models based on the
translational invariant structure of infinite projected entangled pair state
(iPEPS) representations. By employing this method, the $q$-state quantum Potts
model on the square lattice with $q \in \{2, 3 ,4, 5\}$ is investigated as a
prototypical example. Further, we have explored three 2D Heisenberg models,
such as the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXX and antiferromagnetic anisotropic XYX models
in an external magnetic field, and the spin-1 antiferromagnetic XXZ model. We
find that continuous GE does not guarantee a continuous phase transition across
a phase transition point. We observe and thus classify three different types of
continuous GE across a phase transition point: (i) GE is continuous with
maximum value at the transition point and the phase transition is continuous,
(ii) GE is continuous with maximum value at the transition point but the phase
transition is discontinuous, and (iii) GE is continuous with non-maximum value
at the transition point and the phase transition is continuous. For the models
under consideration we find that the second and the third types are related to
a point of dual symmetry and a fully polarized phase, respectively.

opinion, is very helpful in the situations when an experimenter's tools for
preparing quantum states and (or) for measuring the observables of a quantum
system under study are restricted due to some kind of reasons. In this case it
is advisable to use as original an appropriate subspace of complete Hilbert
space of states and respectively to utilize observables acting only in this
subspace. If this subspace possesses some additional symmetries, the structure
of a pure states set, as a rule, is simpler by far than in general case.
Moreover in such SQWs some specific irreducible entangled states may appear.
The similar states could be very helpful in various tasks connected with
quantum informational applications. In the present paper main ideas outlined
above are developed in detail in the simple and instructive case of a two-qubit
system in which the accessible space of states possesses the additional
symmetry structure of permutation group of three elements.

  for discrete-time paths?</title><description>  It is straightforward to give a sum-over-paths expression for the transition
amplitudes of a quantum circuit as long as the gates in the circuit are
balanced, where to be balanced is to have all nonzero transition amplitudes of
equal magnitude. Here we consider the question of whether, for such circuits,
the relative phases of different discrete-time paths through the configuration
space can be defined in terms of a classical action, as they are for
continuous-time paths. We show how to do so for certain kinds of quantum
circuits, namely, Clifford circuits where the elementary systems are
continuous-variable systems or discrete systems of odd-prime dimension. These
types of circuit are distinguished by having phase-space representations that
serve to define their classical counterparts. For discrete systems, the
phase-space coordinates are also discrete variables. We show that for each gate
in the generating set, one can associate a symplectomorphism on the phase-space
and to each of these one can associate a generating function, defined on two
copies of the configuration space. For discrete systems, the latter association
is achieved using tools from algebraic geometry. Finally, we show that if the
action functional for a discrete-time path through a sequence of gates is
defined using the sum of the corresponding generating functions, then it yields
the correct relative phases for the path-sum expression. These results are
likely to be relevant for quantizing physical theories where time is
fundamentally discrete, characterizing the classical limit of discrete-time
quantum dynamics, and proving complexity results for quantum circuits.

they do?&quot; have been long-standing questions. In particular, drawing a clear
borderline between classical and quantum computations is obscure and still
remains controversial. With this issue in mind, we attempt to find a
qualitatively distinguishable feature of quantum computation (QC) in which QC
is a superset of currently known classes of classical probabilistic
computation. The main approach for our study is to consider a seemingly
powerful classical computing machine called a stochastic ensemble machine
(SEnM), which runs with an {\em ensemble} consisting of finite (even infinite,
in principle) copies of a single probabilistic machine, e.g., a probabilistic
Turing machine (PTM). Then, we assume and test the following hypothesis: there
exists an SEnM imitating QC. The test is carried out by introducing an
information-theoretic inequality that we call the readout inequality. This
inequality is obeyed by every SEnM computation and also imposes a critical
condition on QC: if the hypothesis holds, the inequality should be satisfied by
QC for the SEnM imitating it. However, QC can violate the inequality, and the
above hypothesis is generally not accepted. Noting that quantum Turing machine
can cover an SEnM and thinking of SEnM $\supseteq$ PTM in our context, we
conclude that QC is characterized beyond any classical probabilistic
computation in the qualitative sense.

zero-point motion through the optomechanical coupling with a high-finesse
cavity. Cooling results from the interplay between coherent scattering of
cavity photons by the ions, which dynamically modifies the vibrational
spectrum, and cavity losses, that dissipate motional energy. The cooling
mechanism we propose requires that the length scales of the crystal and the
cavity are mismatched so that the system is intrinsically frustrated, leading
to the formation of defects (kinks). When the pump is strong enough, the
anti-Stokes sidebands of all vibrational modes can be simultaneously driven.
These dynamics can be used to prepare ultracold chains of dozens of ions within
tens of milliseconds in state-of-the-art experimental setups. In addition, we
identify parameter regimes of the optomechanical interactions where individual
localized modes can be selectively manipulated, and monitored through the light
at the cavity output. These dynamics exemplify robust quantum reservoir
engineering of strongly-correlated mesoscopic systems and could find
applications in optical cooling of solids.

challenges and provides new opportunities, involving fundamental
quantum-information-theoretic questions and novel quantum-engineered devices.
In quantum mechanics, systems with an evolution described by a so-called unital
quantum channel evolve with a non-decreasing entropy. Here, we seek the
opposite, a system described by a non-unital and, furthermore,
energy-conserving channel that describes a system whose entropy decreases with
time. We propose a setup involving a mesoscopic four-lead scatterer augmented
by a micro-environment in the form of a spin that realizes this goal. Within
this non-unital and energy-conserving quantum channel, the micro-environment
acts with two non-commuting operations on the system in an autonomous way. We
find, that the process corresponds to a partial exchange or swap between the
system and environment quantum states, with the system's entropy decreasing if
the environment's state is more pure. This entropy-decreasing process is
naturally expressed through the action of a quantum Maxwell demon and we
propose a quantum-thermodynamic engine with four qubits that extracts work from
a single heat reservoir when provided with a reservoir of pure qubits. The
special feature of this engine, which derives from the energy-conservation in
the non-unital quantum channel, is its separation into two cycles, a working
cycle and an entropy cycle, allowing to run this engine with no local waste
heat.

  optical network based on wavelength-division multiplexing</title><description>  Classical optical communications may be still the main communications
technology for the foreseeable future, so integration of the quantum
communication network with existing classical optical communication network is
necessary because existing telecommunications infrastructure will be shared.
This means multiplexing of quantum key distribution (QKD) and strong classical
data signals, delivering quantum signals and classic signals in one fiber.
Optical splitters are employed to access each user in a gigabit-capable passive
optical network (GPON). In a 4-user network the splitter adds at least 6 dB of
optical loss to the quantum channel, a 64-user network the splitter adds 18 dB
of optical loss to the quantum channel. The optical splitters restrict the
transmission distance and performance of QKD. We propose a new integration
program of QKD and GPON based on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). At the
optical splitting point, we use filters to separate the quantum signals and
bypass the optical splitter, avoiding losses produced by the optical splitters.
This increases the counting rate of the quantum signals states and the signal
to noise ratio (SNR) improves, so a higher key generation rate and a longer
transmission distance can be obtained with QKD.

proper quantum mechanical description. While a lot of work has already been
done for the simple case of two-mode interference, the multi-mode case has not
been fully explored yet. Here we derive bounds for classical models of light

as a non-classicality witness, able to detect the presence of sources with
sub-Poissonian photon-number statistics. We also derive a criterion for
certifying the indivisibility of a quantum interferometer and obtain a method
to simultaneously measure the average pairwise distinguishability of the input

photon-added Gaussian channels and these are experimentally viable with current
quantum-optical technologies. These channels are obtained by extending Gaussian
channels with photon addition applied to the environment state (in its
respective Stinespring unitary representation) giving rise to a one-parameter
family of non-Gaussian channels indexed by photon number $n$ with $n=0$
corresponding to the underlying Gaussian channel. We then derive the
corresponding operator-sum representation and observe that these channels are
Fock-preserving, i.e., coherence non-generating on incoherent states in the
Fock basis. Furthermore, noisy Gaussian channels can be expressed as a convex
mixture of these non-Gaussian channels analogous to the Fock basis
representation of a thermal state. We then report examples of activation of
nonclassicality, using this method of photon-addition, at outputs of channels
that would otherwise output only classical states, and present a classicality
no-go theorem. We also derive many structure theorems for these channels.
Finally, we observe that there exists an environment-assisted error-correction
scheme for transmitting classical information through these channels. These
channels add to the toolbox of realizable non-Gaussian resources (both states

From this assumption, it is shown how quantum mechanics can produce locally

boson bath via off-diagonal TLS-bath coupling is studied by using optimal
control theory. In the weak system-bath coupling regime where the
time-dependent Bloch-Redfield formalism is applicable, we obtain the Bloch

time-dependent external control field. By using the automatic differentiation

based on geometric phases and superadiabatic quantum control. Consolidating the
advantages of both strategies, the proposed quantum gates are robust and fast.
The diamond nitrogen-vacancy center system is adopted as a typical example to
illustrate the scheme. We show that these gates can be realized in a simple
two-level configuration by appropriately controlling the amplitude, phase, and
frequency of just one microwave field. The gate's robust and fast features are
confirmed by comparing the fidelity of the proposed superadiabatic geometric

readily provide access to single density matrix elements, since it requires a
global reconstruction. Here we experimentally demonstrate a scheme that can be
used to directly measure single density matrix elements of general quantum
states. The scheme relies on measuring a sequence of three observables, each
complementary to the last. The first two measurements are made weak to minimize
the disturbance they cause to the state, while the final measurement is strong.
We perform this joint measurement on polarized photons in pure and mixed states
to directly measure their density matrix. The weak measurements are achieved
using two walk-off crystals, each inducing a polarization-dependent spatial
shift that couples the spatial and polarization degree of freedom of the
photons. This direct measurement method provides an operational meaning to the
density matrix and promises to be especially useful for large dimensional
states.

Such a code is permutation-invariant if it is unchanged under the swapping of
any pair of the underlying qudits. Prior permutation-invariant qubit codes
encode a single qubit while correcting $t$ arbitrary errors, and their logical
codewords have two important properties. First, the Dicke states over which the
logical codewords are superposed over have weights spaced a constant number
apart. Second, the probability of observing each logical codeword as a given
Dicke state is proportional to a binomial coefficient. We design
permutation-invariant qudit codes encoding a single qubit with logical

  Systems</title><description>  Recently (PRL 113, 050403 (2014)) the concept of local symmetries in
one-dimensional stationary wave propagation has been shown to lead to a class
of invariant two-point currents that allow to generalize the parity and Bloch
theorem. In the present work we establish the theoretical framework of local
symmetries for higher-dimensional interacting many-body systems. Based on the
Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy we derive the equations
of motion of local symmetry correlators which are off-diagonal elements of the
reduced one-body density matrix at symmetry related positions. The natural
orbital representation yields equations of motion for the convex sum of the
local symmetry correlators of the natural orbitals as well as for the local
symmetry correlators of the individual orbitals themselves. An alternative
integral representation with a unique interpretation is provided. We discuss
special cases, such as the bosonic and fermionic mean field theory and show in
particular that the invariant two-point currents are recovered in the case of
the non-interacting one-dimensional stationary wave propagation. Finally we
derive the equations of motion for anomalous local symmetry correlators which
indicate the breaking of a global into a local symmetry in the stationary
non-interacting case.

Yet,
the most fundamental process, the scattering of a single photon by a single
atom, is largely unexplored [1-3]. One prominent prediction of quantum optics
is the deterministic absorption of a traveling photon by a single atom,
provided the photon waveform matches spatially and temporally the time-reversed
version of a spontaneously emitted photon [4-12]. Here, we experimentally
address this prediction and investigate the influence of the temporal profile
of the photon on the scattering dynamics using a single trapped atom and
heralded single photons. In a time-resolved measurement of the atomic
excitation we find a 56(11)% increase of the peak excitation by photons with an
exponentially rising profile compared to a decaying one. This result
demonstrates that tailoring the envelope of single photons enables precise
control of the photon-atom interaction.

i.e., states and operations which can be created and performed at no cost. In
the resource theory of coherence free states are diagonal in some fixed basis,
and free operations are those which cannot create coherence for some particular
experimental realization. Recently, some problems of this approach have been
discussed, and new sets of operations have been proposed to resolve these
problems. As an example for such a problem, a quantum operation can be
incoherent in one particular experimental realization, but it still can create
large amount of coherence in another. This problem is resolved by the framework
of genuine quantum coherence. Here, we investigate this concept further and
study other more general sets of operations which cannot create coherence in
any experimental realization. We analyze in detail the mathematical structure
of this class of maps and use this to study possible state transformations
under these operations. We show that deterministic manipulation is severely
limited, even in the asymptotic settings. In particular, this framework does
not have a unique golden unit, i.e., there is no single state from which all
other states can be created deterministically with the free operations. On the
other hand, we show that these theories allow for a richer structure in what
comes to stochastic manipulation of states. In particular, we determine the
optimal probability of conversion among pure states with genuinely incoherent
operations. Still, the aforementioned limitations suggest that any reasonably
powerful resource theory of coherence must contain free operations which can
potentially create coherence in some experimental realization.

ground for the understanding of complex quantum systems. Two-component
Bose-Einstein condensates enable the investigation of this scenario in a
particularly well controlled setting. In a homogeneous system, the transition
between mixed and separated phases is fully characterised by a `miscibility
parameter', based on the ratio of intra- to inter-species interaction
strengths. Here we show, however, that this parameter is no longer the optimal
one for trapped gases, for which the location of the phase boundary depends
critically on atom numbers. We demonstrate how monitoring of damping rates and
frequencies of dipole oscillations enables the experimental mapping of the
phase diagram by numerical implementation of a fully self-consistent
finite-temperature kinetic theory for binary condensates. The change in damping
rate is explained in terms of surface oscillation in the immiscible regime, and
counterflow instability in the miscible regime, with collisions becoming only
important in the long time evolution.

a quantum scenario, one additional critical criterion exists, the capability of
sharing entangled and unknown quantum information. Here by employing a

the shared quantum secrecy can be efficiently reconstructed with a state
fidelity as high as 93%. By observing that any one or two parties cannot
recover the secrecy, we show that our scheme meets the confidentiality

performed on a system which is in contact with an environment of fixed
temperature, the extracted work is bounded by the decrease of the free energy
of the system. However, in a single realization of a generic process, the
extracted work is subject to statistical fluctuations which may allow for
probabilistic violations of the previous bound. We are interested in enhancing
this effect, i.e. we look for thermodynamic processes that maximize the
probability of extracting work above a given arbitrary threshold. For any
process obeying the Jarzynski identity, we determine an upper bound for the
work extraction probability that depends also on the minimum amount of work
that we are willing to extract in case of failure, or on the average work we
wish to extract from the system. Then we show that this bound can be saturated
within the thermodynamic formalism of quantum discrete processes composed by
sequences of unitary quenches and complete thermalizations. We explicitly
determine the optimal protocol which is given by two quasi-static isothermal
transformations separated by a finite unitary quench.

geometry is considered. By performing quantum Monte Carlo simulations in a wide
range of layer spacings we analyze in detail the pair correlation functions,
the static response function, the kinetic and interaction energies. By reducing
the layer spacing we observe a transition from weakly to strongly bound dimer
states. The transition is accompanied by the onset of short-range correlations,
suppression of the superfluid response, and rotonization of the excitation
spectrum. A dispersion law and a dynamic structure factor for the {\em
in-phase} (symmetric) and {\em out-of-phase} (antisymmetric) collective modes,
during the dimerization, is studied in detail with the stochastic
reconstruction method and the method of moments. The antisymmetric mode
spectrum is most strongly influenced by suppression of the inlayer
superfluidity (specified by the superfluid fraction $\gamma_s=\rho_s/\rho$). In
a pure superfluid/normal phase only an acoustic/optical(gapped) mode is
recovered. In a partially superfluid phase, both are present simultaneously,
and the dispersion splits into two branches corresponding to a normal and a
superfluid component. The spectral weight of the acoustic mode scales linearly
with $\gamma_s$. This weight transfers to the optical branch when $\gamma_s$ is
reduced due to formation of dimer states. In summary, we demonstrate how the
interlayer dimerization in dipolar bilayers can be uniquely identified by
static and dynamic properties.

light-matter interaction becomes relevant. Photon bubbling, in particular, has
been identified as the main source of turbulent radiation transport in many
astrophysical objects, such as stars and accretion disks. This mechanism takes
place when radiation trapping in optically dense media becomes unstable,
leading to the energy dissipation from the larger to the smaller bubbles. Here,
we report on the observation of photon bubble turbulence in cold atomic gases
in the presence of multiple scattering of light. The instability is
theoretically explained by a fluid description for the atom density coupled to
a diffusive transport equation for the photons, which is known to be accurate
in the multiple scattering regime investigated here. We determine the power
spectrum of the atom density fluctuations, which displays an unusual $\sim
k^{-4}$ scaling, and entails a complex underlying turbulent dynamics resulting
from the formation of dynamical bubble-like structures. We derive a power
spectrum from the theoretical photon bubble model which, to a high level of
accuracy, explains the observations. The experimental results reported here,
along with the theoretical model we developed may shed light on the analogue
photon bubble instabilities in astrophysical scenarios.

For instance observing the maximal violation of the CHSH inequality certifies
that the two parties share a singlet. While self-testing results are known for
several classes of states, in many cases they are only valid if the observed
statistics are almost perfect, which makes them unsuitable for practical
applications. Practically relevant self-testing bounds are much less common and
moreover they all result from a single numerical method (with one exception

the idealized Dicke model of superradiance there is no entanglement among any
partitions of the system during the total evolution time of the system. This
result immediately conducts us to question if other measures from quantum
information theory can explain the characteristic release of energy in a short
time interval. In this work we identify the uncertainty of purely quantum
origin as the property responsible for Dicke superradiance. The quantum
uncertainty on the population of each emitter of the sample captured by the
Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) is proportional to the correlation
radiation rate, which is the part of the total radiated power coming from
dipole correlations and responsible for releasing in a short time a great
intensity of radiation energy. We also show that the correlation measure called
local quantum uncertainty, which is the minimization of the WYSI over all local
observables, presents a double sudden change induced by environment. The time
window between these two sudden changes is used to define the interval in which
symmetric global observables of the system behave classically for $N
\rightarrow \infty$, although the emitters remain strongly quantum correlated.

a new computation with error at most $2^{-p}$, the most space-efficient method

theory. It is well known that entanglement with an ancillary system can help in
this task, and furthermore that an ancilla with the same dimension as the input
of the channels is always sufficient for optimal discrimination of two
channels. A natural question to ask is whether the same holds true for the
output dimension. That is, in cases when the output dimension of the channels
is (possibly much) smaller than the input dimension, is an ancilla with
dimension equal to the output dimension always sufficient for optimal
discrimination? We show that the answer to this question is &quot;no&quot; by
construction of a family of counterexamples. This family contains instances
with arbitrary finite gap between the input and output dimensions, and still
has the property that in every case, for optimal discrimination, it is
necessary to use an ancilla with dimension equal to that of the input.
  The proof relies on a characterization of all operators on the trace norm
unit sphere that maximize entanglement negativity. In the case of density
operators we generalize this characterization to a broad class of entanglement
measures, which we call weak entanglement measures. This characterization
allows us to conclude that a quantum channel is reversible if and only if it
preserves entanglement as measured by any weak entanglement measure, with the
structure of maximally entangled states being equivalent to the structure of
reversible maps via the Choi isomorphism. We also include alternate proofs of
other known characterizations of channel reversibility.

under unitary operations that act independently on each; ER=EPR suggests that
an analogous statement should hold for wormholes. We accordingly prove a new
area theorem in general relativity: for a collection of dynamical wormholes and
black holes in a spacetime satisfying the null curvature condition, the maximin
area for a subset of the horizons (giving the largest area attained by the
minimal cross section of the multi-wormhole throat separating the subset from
its complement) is invariant under classical time evolution along the outermost
apparent horizons. The evolution can be completely general, including horizon

decomposition property. This has to be contrasted with s=1, where the cluster
property holds. Correspondingly, for s=1, one gets a light-cone profile in the
propagation of excitations after a local quench, while the cone is absent for
s$\ge$2, as shown by quasi-exact time dependent
density-matrix-renormalization-group (t-DMRG) numerical simulations. Moreover
we introduce and determine the ground-state and correlation functions of
another solvable model of half-integer spins, which we call Fredkin spin chain,
whose ground-state can be expressed in terms of superposition of all Dyck
paths. Also in this case we find that for s=1/2, a cone-like propagation occurs
while the for higher spins, s$\ge$3/2, the colors prevent any cone formation.

  oscillators</title><description>  Simulating a network of Ising spins with physical systems is now emerging as
a promising approach for solving mathematically intractable problems. Here we
report a large-scale network of artificial spins based on degenerate optical
parametric oscillators (DOPO), paving the way towards a photonic Ising machine
capable of solving difficult combinatorial optimization problems. We generated
&gt;10,000 time-division-multiplexed DOPOs using dual-pump four-wave mixing (FWM)
in a highly nonlinear fibre (HNLF) placed in a fibre cavity. Using those DOPOs,
a one-dimensional (1D) Ising model was simulated by introducing
nearest-neighbour optical coupling. We observed the formation of spin domains
and found that the domain size diverged near the DOPO threshold, which suggests
that the DOPO network can simulate the behavior of low-temperature Ising spins.

directed transport, are at the heart of correlation function calculations of
the two-dimensional Ising model, and have applications in quantum information
science. We derive their eigenvalues and eigenvectors when the symbol is
singular Fisher-Hartwig. We then add diagonal disorder and study the resulting
eigenpairs. We find that there is a &quot;bulk&quot; behavior that is well captured by
second order perturbation theory of non-Hermitian matrices. We find two classes
of non-perturbative behavior. First, we call Runaways type I that leave the
complex-valued spectrum and become completely real because of eigenvalue
attraction. Runaways type II leave the bulk and move very rapidly in response
to perturbations. These have high condition numbers and can be predicted. We
use entropies and inverse participation ratios to quantify the localization of
the eigenvectors. We find that eigenvectors corresponding to Runaways type II
are most localized (i.e., super-exponential), whereas Runaways type I are less
localized than the unperturbed counterparts and have most of their probability
mass in the interior with algebraic decays. We corroborate our results by
applying free probability theory and provide various supporting numerical

network is a key task at the basis of quantum communication, quantum
computation and quantum cryptography. The usual protocol between two nodes is
the following: Alice locally entangles two systems and, successively, she sends
one of them to Bob via a physical communication channel. However quantum
correlations are very fragile and the initial entanglement may be degraded
because of imperfections in the transmission process. This phenomenon boosted
the introduction of several techniques aiming at restoring quantum
correlations, mostly taking advantage of local operations and classical
communication. Unfortunately some channels introduce so much perturbations and
noise in the transmitted signal that they always produce separable output
states, thus removing any possibility to be amended via the aforementioned
tools. For this reason these maps are called entanglement-breaking and are
usually judged as completely useless for quantum communication purposes. In
this work we prove that this is not necessarily the case: we set up a quantum
optics experiment, based on the transmission of single-photon polarization
states, in which we manage to transmit entanglement having at disposal only two
entanglement-breaking channels. The mechanism underpinning this result is a
protocol which we dub cut-and-paste, as it consists in extracting and
reshuffling the sub-components of these maps, which finally succeed in
&quot;correcting each other&quot;. The proof of this counterintuitive phenomenon, while
improving our theoretical understanding of quantum entanglement, has also a
direct application in the realization of quantum information networks based on
imperfect and highly noisy communication lines.

towards the infinite future. Like a big rip singularity, a little rip implies
the destruction of all bounded structure in the Universe and is thus an event
where quantum effects could be important. We present here a new phantom scalar
field model for the little rip. The quantum analysis is performed in quantum
geometrodynamics, with the Wheeler-DeWitt equation as its central equation. We
find that the little rip can be avoided in the sense of the DeWitt criterion,
that is, by having a vanishing wave function at the place of the little rip.
Therefore our analysis completes the answer to the question: can quantum
cosmology smoothen or avoid the divergent behavior genuinely caused by phantom
matter? We show that this can indeed happen for the little rip, similar to the
avoidance of a big rip and a little sibling of the big rip.

of measurements (random variables) with known joint distributions of some of
its subsets. However, if these subsets of measurements are not disjoint,
contextuality is mathematically impossible even if one generally allows (as one
must) for random variables not to be jointly distributed. To avoid
contradictions one has to adopt the Contextuality-by-Default approach:
measurements made in different contexts are always distinct and stochastically
unrelated to each other. Contextuality is reformulated then in terms of the
(im)possibility of imposing on all the measurements in a system a joint
distribution of a particular kind: such that any measurements of one and the
same property made in different contexts satisfy a specified property,
$\mathcal{C}$. In the traditional analysis of contextuality $\mathcal{C}$ means
&quot;are equal to each other with probability 1&quot;. However, if the system of
measurements violates the &quot;no-disturbance principle&quot;, due to signaling or
experimental biases, then the meaning of $\mathcal{C}$ has to be generalized,
and the proposed generalization is &quot;are equal to each other with maximal
possible probability&quot; (applied to any set of measurements of one and the same
property). This approach is illustrated on arbitrary systems of binary
measurements, including most of quantum systems of traditional interest in
contextuality studies (irrespective of whether &quot;no-disturbance&quot; principle holds
in them).

experimentally. Applying the tools of quantum estimation theory to a general
Dicke model, we quantify how much information about the diamagnetic term (or
lack thereof) is contained in the ground state of the coupled system. We
demonstrate that feasible measurements, such as homodyne detection or photon
counting, give access to a significant fraction of such information. These

We further show that, should the model admit a critical point, both

approach for studying these lattice spin models, but has so far been limited to
one-dimensional systems. This work argues that such quantum simulation
techniques are extendable to a 2D ion crystal confined in a radiofrequency (rf)
trap. Using appropriately chosen parameters, driven ion motion due to the rf
fields can be made small and will not limit the types of quantum spin models
that can be experimentally encoded. The rf-driven motion is calculated to
modestly reduce the stability region of a 2D crystal and must be considered
when designing the 2D trap. The system will be scalable to 100+ quantum
particles, far beyond the realm of classical intractability, while maintaining
the traditional ion-trap strengths of individual-ion control, long quantum

physicists and philosophers have mused about the `spooky action at a distance'
aspect of quantum mechanics that so bothered Einstein. In his formal analysis
of EPR-type entangled quantum states, Bell (1964) concluded that any hidden
variable theory designed to reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics must
necessarily be nonlocal and allow superluminal interactions. This doesn't
immediately imply that nonlocality is a characteristic feature of quantum
mechanics let alone a fundamental property of nature; however, many physicists
and philosophers of science do harbor this belief. Experts in the field often
use the term `nonlocality' to designate particular non-classical aspects of
quantum entanglement and do not confuse the term with superluminal
interactions. However, many physicists seem to take the term more literally. I
endeavor to disabuse the latter of this notion by emphasizing that the
correlations of Bell-type entanglement are a result of ordinary quantum
superposition with no need to introduce nonlocality. The conclusion of the EPR
paper wasn't that quantum mechanics is nonlocal but rather that it is an
incomplete description of reality. For different reasons, many physicists,
including me, agree with Einstein that quantum mechanics is necessarily an
incomplete description of reality.

in many fields ranging from condensed matter to high energy physics. Developing
numerically efficient and accurate simulation methods is an indispensable part
of this. Already in equilibrium, fermions are notoriously hard to handle due to
the sign problem. Out of equilibrium, an important outstanding problem is the
efficient numerical simulation of the dynamics of these systems. In this work
we develop a new semi-classical phase-space approach (a.k.a. the truncated
Wigner approximation) for simulating dynamics of interacting lattice fermions
in arbitrary dimensions. As fermions are essentially non-classical objects, a
phase-space is constructed out of all fermionic bilinears. Classical
phase-space is thus comprised of highly non-local (hidden) variables
representing these bilinears, and the cost of the method is that it scales
quadratic rather than linear with system size. We demonstrate the strength of
the method by comparing the results to exact diagonalization (ED) on small 1D
and 2D systems. We furthermore present results on a larger, intractable by ED,
2D model of interacting fermions and show that this method describes quenches
and ramps in strongly correlated regimes, where all mean-field methods are

approached within a limiting procedure of the Pegg-Barnett type. For unbounded
observables, we need to take into account a finiteness of detector resolution.
To provide the positivity of entropic measures of indeterminacy, we consider
measurement statistics sampled in bins. Properties of resulting probability
distributions are characterized by means of generalized entropies of both the
R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis types. For the first scenario of successive measurements,
the introduced measures of uncertainties are an immediate recast of entropic
measures used for successive projective measurements. The only change required
concerns a physically meaningful form of the post-first-measurement state. In
the second scenario of successive measurements, each actual result of the first
measurement is assumed to be kept. In the case of observables with discrete
spectra, any entropic measure of uncertainties appeared as a single conditional
entropy. It is shown that more accurate quantification is needed in the case of
observables with continuous spectra. An appropriate extension is proposed and
motivated. The R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis formulation of uncertainty relations are
obtained for both the scenarios of successive measurements of canonically

nanomechanical systems and gas ensembles. While few-qubit quantum information
demonstrations have been performed with such macroscopic systems, a quantum
algorithm showing exponential speedup over classical algorithms is yet to be

two mapping procedures which can be chosen depending upon the constraints of
the oracle and the experiment. Both methods have an exponential speedup over

multiple observers on the other wing who act sequentially and independently of
each other [1]. We first show that the optimality condition for the trade-off

positive operator valued measures (POVMs). Using this formalism we then prove
analytically that it is impossible to obtain violation of the

This induces an energy exchange between bulk and wall and generates an

the width of the oscillating scalar pulse is inversely linked to the energy

involving polyatomic molecules has not been explored so far. Here we address
this problem performing a merged-beam study of the He*+CHF$_3$ Penning
ionization reaction in a range of collision energies $E/k_B$=0.5--120 K. The
experimental cross sections are compared with total reaction cross sections
calculated within the framework of the quantum defect theory. We find that the
broad range of collision energies combined with the relatively small rotational
constants of \chfs makes rotationally inelastic collisions a crucial player in
the total reaction dynamics. Quantitative agreement between theory and
experiment is only obtained if the energy-dependent probability for rotational
excitation is included in the calculations, in stark contrast to previous
experiments where classical scaling laws were able to describe the results.

balanced with the extreme isolation of the qubits from the environment. Atomic
qubit systems typically mitigate this balance through the use of gated laser
fields that can create superpositions and entanglement between qubits. Here we
propose the use of high-order optical Stark shifts from optical fields to
manipulate the splitting of atomic qubits that are insensitive to other types

and show how these controlled shifts can produce an arbitrary product state of
ten ions as well as generate site-specific magnetic field terms in a simulated

and coupling strength with the probe. Considering the natural global unitary
evolution of both bath and probe and assuming initial global Gaussian states we
are able to solve the main issues of any quantum metrological problem: the best
achievable precision determined by the quantum Fisher information, the best
initial state and the best measurement. We emphasis the effects of the
non-Markovian bath by studying the short time behavior and find out the essence
of non-Markovian effects such as increase in quantum Fisher information. We
show that at this time scale the non-Markovian dynamics is much closer to the
free dynamics than the Markovian equivalent. This brings huge consequences for
the sequential measurement as the quantum Fisher information becomes unbounded
when the initial probe mean energy goes to infinity, whereas its Markovian
counterpart remains bounded by a constant. The long time behavior shows the
complexity and potential variety of non-Markovian effects, somewhere between
the exponential decay characteristic of Markovian dynamics and the sinusoidal
oscillations characteristic of resonant narrow band.

Initially, two parties, Alice and Bob, share a two-mode separable Gaussian
state. Alice then splits her mode into two separable modes and distributes them
between two players. Bob is separable from the players but he can create
entanglement with either of the players if the other player moves to his
location and collaborates with him. Any two parties are separable and the
creation of entanglement is thus mediated by transmission of a mode which is
separable from individual modes on Alice's and Bob's side. For the state shared
by the players and Bob one cannot establish entanglement between any two modes
even with the help of operation on the third mode provided that Bob is
restricted to Gaussian measurements and the state thus carries a nontrivial
signature of bound entanglement. The present protocol also demonstrates
switching between different separability classes of tripartite systems by
coherent operations on its bipartite parts and complements studies on protocols
utilizing mixed partially entangled multipartite states.

states of a four level trapped ion quantum system are computed for
time-evolving ionic states driven by Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians with
interactions mapped onto a $\mbox{SU}(2)\otimes \mbox{SU}(2)$ group structure.
Using the correspondence of the method of simulating a $3+1$ dimensional
Dirac-like Hamiltonian for bi-spinor particles into a single trapped ion, one
preliminarily obtains the analytical tools for describing ionic state
transition probabilities as a typical quantum oscillation feature. For
Dirac-like structures driven by generalized Poincar\'e classes of coupling
potentials, one also identifies the $\mbox{SU}(2)\otimes \mbox{SU}(2)$ internal
degrees of freedom corresponding to intrinsic parity and spin polarization as
an adaptive platform for computing the quantum entanglement between the
internal quantum subsystems which define two-qubit ionic states. The obtained
quantum correlational content is then translated into the quantum entanglement
of two-qubit ionic states with quantum numbers related to the total angular
momentum and to its projection onto the direction of the trapping magnetic
field. Experimentally, the controllable parameters simulated by ion traps can
be mapped into a Dirac-like system in the presence of an electrostatic field
which, in this case, is associated to ionic carrier interactions. Besides
exhibiting a complete analytical profile for ionic quantum transitions and
quantum entanglement, our results indicate that carrier interactions actively
drive an overall suppression of the quantum entanglement.

quantum technologies, including communication systems and modular computers.
Experimental results achieved to date indicate that the fidelity of operations
within each ion trap module will be far higher than the fidelity of operations
involving the links; fortunately internal storage and processing can
effectively upgrade the links through the process of purification. Here we
perform the most detailed analysis to date on this purification task, using a
protocol which is balanced to maximise fidelity while minimising the device
complexity and the time cost of the process. Moreover we 'compile down' the
quantum circuit to device-level operations including cooling and shutting
events. We find that a linear trap with only five ions (two of one species,
three of another) can support our protocol while incorporating desirable
features such as 'global control', i.e. laser control pulses need only target
an entire zone rather than differentiating one ion from its neighbour. To
evaluate the capabilities of such a module we consider its use both as a
universal communications node for quantum key distribution, and as the basic
repeating unit of a quantum computer. For the latter case we evaluate the
threshold for fault tolerant quantum computing using the surface code, finding
acceptable fidelities for the 'raw' entangling link as low as 83% (or under 75%

fundamental physics which assumes a much stronger synergy between cosmology and
quantum physics than exists in contemporary theory. In IST the (quasi-cyclic)
universe $U$ is treated as a deterministic dynamical system evolving precisely
on a measure-zero fractal invariant subset $I_U$ of its state space. In this
approach, the geometry of $I_U$, and not a set of differential evolution
equations in space-time $\mathcal M_U$, provides the most primitive description
of the laws of physics. As such, IST is non-classical. The geometry of $I_U$ is
based on Cantor sets of space-time trajectories in state space, homeomorphic to
the algebraic set of $p$-adic integers, for large but finite $p$. In IST, the
non-commutativity of position and momentum observables arises from number
theory - in particular the non-commensurateness of $\phi$ and $\cos \phi$. The
complex Hilbert Space and the relativistic Dirac Equation respectively are
shown to describe $I_U$, and evolution on $I_U$, in the singular limit of IST
at $p=\infty$; particle properties such as de Broglie relationships arise from
the helical geometry of trajectories on $I_U$ in the neighbourhood of $\mathcal
M_U$. With the p-adic metric as a fundamental measure of distance on $I_U$,
certain key perturbations which seem conspiratorially small relative to the
more traditional Euclidean metric, take points away from $I_U$ and are
therefore unphysically large. This allows (the $\psi$-epistemic) IST to evade
the Bell and Pusey et al theorems without fine tuning or other objections. In
IST, the problem of quantum gravity becomes one of combining the
pseudo-Riemannian metric of $\mathcal M_U$ with the p-adic metric of $I_U$. A
generalisation of the field equations of general relativity which can achieve
this is proposed.

Germany. For natural parity states the results are very close to the
predictions of Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for the nearest-neighbor spacing

parameter $\omega$, which takes the value $\omega=0$ for regular systems and
$\omega \simeq 1$ for chaotic systems. We obtain $\omega=0.85 \pm 0.02$ which
is, to our knowledge, the closest value to chaos ever observed in experimental
bound states of nuclei. By contrast, the results for unnatural parity states
are far from RMT behavior. We interpret these results as a consequence of the

experimental data, is much stronger for natural than for unnatural parity
states. In addition our results show that chaotic and non-chaotic nuclear

connected to a hot and cold reservoir. The heat baths are modelled using the
stochastic surrogate Hamiltonian method. The molecule is modelled by an
asymmetric double-well potential. Each well is semi-locally connected to a heat
bath composed of spins. The dynamics is driven by a combined system-bath
Hamiltonian. The temperature of the baths is regulated by a secondary spin bath
composed of identical spins in thermal equilibrium. A random swap operation
exchange spins between the primary and secondary baths. The combined system is
studied in various system-bath coupling strengths. In all cases the average
heat current always flows from the hot towards the cold bath in accordance to
the second law of thermodynamics. The asymmetry of the double well generates a
rectifying effect meaning that when the left and right baths are exchanged the
heat current follows the hot to cold direction. The heat current is larger when
the high frequency is coupled to the hot bath. Adding an external driving field
can reverse the transport direction. Such a refrigeration effect is modelled by
a periodic driving field in resonance with the frequency difference of the two
potential wells. A minimal driving amplitude is required to overcome the heat
leak effect. In the strong driving regime the cooling power is non-monotonic
with the system-bath coupling.

parallel to the direction of laser propagation ($\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$) will
either grow or decay logarithmically along $\boldsymbol{\hat{k}}$, depending on
the detuning of the laser. The symmetry of the system for atomic separations of

appearance of a collection of extremely subradiant states ($\Gamma\sim 0$),
disrupts the described trend. In order to interpret the results from a finite

more precisely: for a normal state on a von Neumann algebra. It describes a
situation where from an arbitrary initial state it is possible to prepare a
target state with arbitrary precision by a repeated interaction with a sequence
of copies of another system. For $\mathcal{B}(\mathcal{H})$ we give criteria
sufficient to ensure that all normal states are universally preparable which
can be verified for a class of non-commutative birth and death processes
realized, in particular, by the interaction of a micromaser with a stream of
atoms. As a tool the theory of tight sequences of states and of stationary
states is further developed and we show that in the presence of stationary
faithful normal states universal preparability of all normal states is
equivalent to asymptotic completeness, a notion studied earlier in connection
with the scattering theory of non-commutative Markov processes.

chip. In contrast to subwavelength nanofibres it is generally not possible to
create a stable trapping potential using only the fundamental modes. This is
why we create a stable trapping potential by using two different laser colors,
such that the waveguide supports two modes for the blue detuned laser, while
for the red detuned light the waveguide has only a single mode. In particular,
we study such a two-color trap for Cesium atoms, and calculate both the

asymptotic relative entropy of entanglement. We disprove both conjectures by
explicitly constructing a special class of mixed two-qubit states. We then

receiver cannot be greater than the communication bits from a sender, even if
they utilize nonlocal quantum resources. This physical principle has known to
successfully rule out some post-quantum correlations. However, some of quantum
resources (concretely, partially entangled states) inevitably superpose
randomness on the communication bits. Such randomness, which enters through the
outcome of the remote measurement by the sender, is intrinsic in nonlocal
resources and hence will not be removed in a technical way. To study the
effects of such remote randomness, we derive both IC-type and pairwise
independent IC-type formulas including the effects in quantum formalism. The
latter formula is tight and saturated at some quantum mechanical boundary in
the space of no-signaling correlations, and the strength of the quantum
correlations at the boundary is considered to be limited by a cryptographic
principle rather than IC. Moreover, we show a device-independent method to
calculate a lower bound of the degree of the remote randomness, and demonstrate
an example of such calculations. This is also a device-independent bound of
nonorthogonality by its definition.

  Attenuator</title><description>  We prove that Gaussian thermal input states minimize the output von Neumann
entropy of the one-mode Gaussian quantum-limited attenuator for fixed input
entropy. The Gaussian quantum-limited attenuator models the attenuation of an
electromagnetic signal in the quantum regime. The Shannon entropy of an
attenuated real-valued classical signal is a simple function of the entropy of
the original signal. A striking consequence of energy quantization is that the
output von Neumann entropy of the quantum-limited attenuator is no more a
function of the input entropy alone. The proof starts from the majorization
result of De Palma et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 62, 2895 (2016), and is
based on a new isoperimetric inequality. Our result implies that geometric
input probability distributions minimize the output Shannon entropy of the
thinning for fixed input entropy. Moreover, our result opens the way to the
multimode generalization, that permits to determine both the triple trade-off
region of the Gaussian quantum-limited attenuator and the classical capacity

credible possibility of their detection lies in the present day gravitational
wave detector set-ups, which effectively detects the relative length-scale

anticipate the relative size of various response terms. We also argue how the

  Meanwhile, we take the opportunity to study the complexity classes

disorder-averaged negativity and the mutual information are proportional to the
number of singlets shared between the two intervals. Using the strong-disorder
renormalization group (SDRG), we prove that the negativity of two adjacent
intervals grows logarithmically with the intervals length. In particular, the
scaling behavior is the same as in conformal field theory, but with a different
prefactor. For two disjoint intervals the negativity is given by a universal
simple function of the cross ratio, reflecting scale invariance. As a function
of the distance of the two intervals, the negativity decays algebraically in
contrast with the exponential behavior in clean models. We confirm our

Here we investigate the power spectrum and the second-order correlation

dramatic variation of the triggered surface plasmon near the metal, the
fluorescence has a notable contribution from the quadrupole moment. The
{\pi}-rotation symmetry of the fluorescence to the QD orientation under the DA

  open spin chains</title><description>  We discuss an open-system analogue of a topological Thouless pump in the
steady state of a one-dimensional spin lattice driven by Markovian reservoirs.
Periodic variations in a two-dimensional parameter space are shown to lead to
quantized transport through the lattice. On an extremal path in parameter space
the steady state is pure state and coincides with the ground state of the
Rice-Mele Hamiltonian for fermions at half filling. Here the quantized
transport can be associated with a topological invariant based on geometric
phases, the Chern number. On a more general path, where the steady state is
mixed, we introduce the winding of the many-body polarization as a generalized
topological invariant. We show that it applies to open quantum systems and
includes the effects of interactions and moderate particle-number fluctuations.
The winding of polarization, which characterizes the Thouless pump is robust
against Hamiltonian perturbations as well as dephasing and particle losses.

asymmetry respectively. In contrast to the resource theory of coherence and
asymmetry, we construct a natural measure of quantum coherence inspired from
optical coherence theory while the group theoretical approach is employed to
quantify the asymmetry of quantum states. Besides their simple structures and
explicit physical meanings, we observe that these quantities are intimately
related to the purity (or linear entropy) of the corresponding quantum states.
Remarkably, we demonstrate that the proposed coherence quantifier is not only a
measure of mixedness, but also an intrinsic (basis-independent) quantification
of quantum coherence contained in quantum states, which can also be viewed as a
normalized version of Brukner-Zeilinger invariant information. In our context,
the asymmetry of N-qubit quantum systems is considered under local independent
and collective SU(2) transformations. Intriguingly, it is illustrated that the
collective effect has a significant impact on the asymmetry measure, and
quantum correlation between subsystems plays a non-negligible role in this
circumstance.

resources like coherence and entanglement can be exploited for novel or
enhanced ways of transmitting and manipulating information, such as quantum
cryptography, teleportation, and quantum computing. We now know that there is
potentially much more than entanglement behind the power of quantum information
processing. There exist more general forms of non-classical correlations,
stemming from fundamental principles such as the necessary disturbance induced
by a local measurement, or the persistence of quantum coherence in all possible
local bases. These signatures can be identified and are resilient in almost all
quantum states, and have been linked to the enhanced performance of certain
quantum protocols over classical ones in noisy conditions. Their presence
represents, among other things, one of the most essential manifestations of
quantumness in cooperative systems, from the subatomic to the macroscopic
domain. In this work we give an overview of the current quest for a proper
understanding and characterisation of the frontier between classical and
quantum correlations in composite states. We focus on various approaches to
define and quantify general quantum correlations, based on different yet
interlinked physical perspectives, and comment on the operational significance
of the ensuing measures for quantum technology tasks such as information
encoding, distribution, discrimination and metrology. We then provide a broader
outlook of a few applications in which quantumness beyond entanglement looks
fit to play a key role.

  scales</title><description>  To study the phenomenon of decoherence the effective Lagrangian of a test
particle interacting with an ideal gas is derived in the leading order of the
perturbation expansion and in order $\ord{\partial^2_t}$. Two concepts of
decoherence are distinguished and investigated in details: The general
dynamical decoherence and the stationary decoherence, an approximation of the
dynamical phenomenon corresponding to the assumption of a static test particle
trajectory. Comparison of the stationary decoherence described by the present
effective theory with the traditional description of decoherence based on
collision theory reveals a qualitative similarity within their domain of
applicability. However, the effective theory predicts comparable time scales
for decoherence and dissipation in contrast to the deviation of this scales by
many orders of magnitudes, estimated by referring to the collision approach. In
particular the extremely fast decoherence predicted by the collisional approach
can only be reproduced by the effective theory for parameter values which
violate the applicability of both approaches. On the other hand, in harmonic
systems, the true dynamical decoherence is indeed an extremely fast process
involving a double exponential time dependence. It is argued that, in realistic
systems, the dissipative effective dynamics is non-perturbative in nature and
its asymptotic, relaxed state incorporates strong quantum fluctuations.

light shift free magic wavelength lattice configuration, it remains as one
distinct principle limitation beyond collective atomic decay. In this work we
study the limitations originating from laser phase and amplitude noise in an

of the frequency sensitivity with increasing atom number while amplitude noise
implies a scaling of $1/\sqrt{\tau}$ with the measurement time. We propose a

considering a truncated hierarchy of equations for the correlation functions.
We consider two hierarchy truncation schemes with a global cutoff on the
correlation order, which is the sum of the exponents of the operators involved
in the correlation functions: a 'hard' cutoff corresponding to an expansion
around the vacuum, which applies to a regime where the number of excitations
per site is small; a 'soft' cutoff which corresponds to an expansion around
coherent states, which can be applied for large excitation numbers per site.
This approach is applied to describe the bunching-antibunching transition in
the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model for photonic systems. The results
have been successfully benchmarked by comparison with calculations based on the
corner-space renormalization method in 1D and 2D systems. The regime of

  due to chaos assisted tunneling effects with cold atoms</title><description>  In the presence of a complex classical dynamics associated with a mixed phase
space, a quantum wave function can tunnel between two stable islands through
the chaotic sea, an effect that has no classical counterpart. This phenomenon,
referred to as chaos assisted tunneling, is characterized by large fluctuations
of the tunneling rate when a parameter is varied. To date the full extent of
this effect as well as the associated statistical distribution have never been
observed in a quantum system. Here we analyze the possibility of characterizing
these effects accurately in a cold atom experiment. Using realistic values of
the parameters of an experimental setup, we examine through analytical
estimates and extensive numerical simulations a specific system that can be
implemented with cold atoms, the atomic modulated pendulum. We assess the
efficiency of three possible routes to observe in detail chaos assisted
tunneling properties. Our main conclusion is that due to the fragility of the
symmetry between positive and negative momenta as a function of quasimomentum,
it is very challenging to use tunneling between classical islands centered on
fixed points with opposite momentum. We show that it is more promising to use
islands symmetric in position space, and characterize the regime where it could
be done. The proposed experiment could be realized with current
state-of-the-art technology.

dispersively coupled to a massive mechanical resonator. A double-pulse Ramsey
interferometer can be implemented with the spin-mechanical setup, where the
second Ramsey microwave pulse drives the spin conditioned on the number states
of the resonator. The probability for finding the NV center in definite spin
states exhibits interference fringes when the mechanical resonator is prepared
in a specific number state. On the other hand, the interference is destroyed if
the mechanical resonator stays in some other number states. The wavelike and
particlelike behavior of the NV spin can be superposed by preparing the
mechanical resonator in a superposition of two distinct number states. Thus a
quantum version of Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment is implemented, allowing

analytically a teleportation scheme with fidelity $100\%$ for optical number
states of arbitrary dimension using linear optical elements only. To this end,
we develop an EPR source to supply Bell-type states for the teleportation, and
show how the same set-up can also be used as a Bell-state analyser (BSA) when
implemented in a time-reversal manner. These two aspects are then brought
together to complete the teleportation protocol in a scheme that can deliver
perfect fidelity, albeit with an efficiency that decays exponentially as the
occupation of the number states increases stepwise. The EPR source and BSA
schemes both consist of two optical axes in a symmetrical V-shape experimental
layout, along which beam-splitters are placed cross-beam fashion at regular
intervals, with their transmittivities treated as variables for which the
values are calculated ad hoc. In particular, we show the full treatment for the
case of qutrit teleportation, and calculate the transmittivity values of the
beam splitters required for teleporting qubits, qutrits, qupentits, quheptits
and qunits. The general case for arbitrary-dimensional number state
teleportation is demonstrated through a counting argument.

would enable us to perform certain computations hundreds of orders of magnitude
faster than digital computers. This feature is coined as &quot;quantum supremacy&quot;
and one aspect or another of such quantum computational supremacy might be
brought about in experiments in the near future: by implementing quantum
error-correction, systems of non-interacting bosons, exotic new phases of
matter called anyons, quantum annealing, or in various other ways.
  A main concern regarding the feasibility of quantum computers is that quantum
systems are inherently noisy: we cannot accurately control them, and we cannot
accurately describe them. We will describe an optimistic hypothesis of quantum
noise that would allow quantum computing and a pessimistic hypothesis that
wouldn't. The quantum computer puzzle is deciding between these two hypotheses.
  Here is a brief summary of the author's pessimistic point of view as
explained in the paper: understanding quantum computers in the presence of
noise requires consideration of behavior at different scales. In the small
scale, standard models of noise from the mid-90s are suitable, and quantum
evolutions and states described by them manifest a very low-level computational
power. This small-scale behavior has far-reaching consequences for the behavior
of noisy quantum systems at larger scales. On the one hand, it does not allow
reaching the starting points for quantum fault tolerance and quantum supremacy,
making them both impossible at all scales. On the other hand, it leads to novel
implicit ways for modeling noise at larger scales and to various predictions on
the behavior of noisy quantum systems.

global space into subsystems. Currencies are a special set of resources chosen
to quantify all others - like Bell pairs in LOCC or a lifted weight in
thermodynamics. We show that from very weak assumptions on the theory we can
already find useful currencies that give us necessary and sufficient conditions
for resource conversion, and we build up more results as we impose further

excited two-level atom in the vicinity of an ideal invisibility cloaking. On
this base, first, a canonical quantization scheme is presented for the
electromagnetic field interacting with atomic systems in an anisotropic,
inhomogeneous and absorbing magnetodielectric medium which can suitably be used
for studying the influence of arbitrary invisibility cloak on the atomic
radiative properties. The time dependence of the atomic subsystem is obtained
in the Schrodinger picture. By introducing a modified set of the spherical wave
vector functions, the Green tensor of the system is calculated via the
continuous and discrete methods. In this formalism, the decay rate and as well
the emission pattern of the aforementioned atom are computed analytically for
both weak and strong coupling interaction, and then numerically calculations
are done to demonstrate the performances of cloaking in the quantum mechanics
domain. Special attention is paid to different possible orientations and
locations of atomic system near the spherical invisibility cloaking. Results in
the presence and the absence of the invisibility cloak are compared. We find
that the cloak works very well far from its resonance frequency to conceal a
macroscopic object, whereas at near the resonance frequency the object is more
visible than the situation that the object is not covered by the cloak.

  information complexity</title><description>  While exponential separations are known between quantum and randomized
communication complexity for partial functions (Raz, STOC 1999), the best known
separation between these measures for a total function is quadratic, witnessed
by the disjointness function. We give the first super-quadratic separation
between quantum and randomized communication complexity for a total function,
giving an example exhibiting a power 2.5 gap. We also present a nearly optimal
quadratic separation between randomized communication complexity and the
logarithm of the partition number, improving upon the previous best power 1.5
separation due to G\&quot;o\&quot;os, Jayram, Pitassi, and Watson.
  Our results are the communication analogues of separations in query
complexity proved using the recent cheat sheet framework of Aaronson,
Ben-David, and Kothari (STOC 2016). Our main technical results are randomized
communication and information complexity lower bounds for a family of
functions, called lookup functions, that generalize and port the cheat sheet
framework to communication complexity.

optical lattice in a high-finesse cavity. The atom-cavity coupling yields an
effective secondary lattice potential, whose wavelength is incommensurate with
the periodicity of the optical lattice. The cavity lattice can induce
localization of the atomic wave function analogously to the Aubry-Andr\'e
localization transition. Starting from the master equation for the cavity and
the atom we perform a mapping of the system dynamics to a Hubbard Hamiltonian,
which can be reduced to the Harper's Hamiltonian in appropriate limits. We
evaluate the phase diagram for the atom ground state and show that the
transition between extended and localized wavefunction is controlled by the
strength of the cavity nonlinearity, which determines the size of the localized
region and the behaviour of the Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov exponent, in
particular, exhibits resonance-like behaviour in correspondence with the
optomechanical resonances. Finally we discuss the experimental feasibility of
these predictions.

high-power fiber laser at 1560 nm, through an extracavity frequency doubling
system, a 780-nm pump with a power as high as 742 mW is realized. After single
passing through a periodically poled KTiOPO4 (PPKTP) crystal, degenerate
down-converted photon pairs are generated. With an overall detection efficiency
of 14.8 %, the count rates of the single photons and coincidence of the photon
pairs are measured to be 370 kHz and 22 kHz, respectively. The spectra of the
signal and idler photons are centered at 1560.23 and 1560.04 nm, while their
3-dB bandwidths being 3.22 nm both. The joint spectrum of the photon pair is
observed to be frequency anti correlated and have a spectral bandwidth of 0.52
nm. According to the ratio of the single photon spectral bandwidth to the joint
spectral bandwidth of the photon pairs, the degree of frequency entanglement is
quantified to be 6.19. Based on a Hong Ou Mandel interferometric coincidence

for those who wish to delve into the realm of using continuous variables, to
describe quantum states of light and optical interferometry. We discuss the
advantages of Wigner functions and their use to describe many quantum states of
light. Throughout our metrology discussions, we will also discuss various
quantum limits and use quantum Fisher information to show optimal bounds. When
applicable, we also discuss the use of quantum Gaussian information and how it
relates to our Wigner function treatment. The remainder of our discussion
focuses on investigating the effects of photon addition and subtraction to
various states of light and analyze the nondeterministic nature of this
process. We use examples of $m$ photon additions to a coherent state as well as
discuss the properties of an $m$ photon subtracted thermal state. We also
provide an argument that this process must always be a nondeterministic one, or
the ability to violate quantum limits becomes apparent. We show that using
phase measurement as one's metric is much more restrictive, which limits the
usefulness of photon addition and subtraction. When we consider SNR however, we
show improved SNR statistics, at the cost of increased measurement time. In
this case of SNR, we also quantify the efficiency of the photon addition and
subtraction process.

quantum information, we derive a model-independent picture of black hole
quantum computing. It has been noticed that this picture exhibits striking
similarities with quantum critical condensates, allowing the use of a common
language to describe quantum computing in both systems. We analyze such quantum
computing by allowing coupling to external modes, under the condition that the
external influence must be soft-enough in order not to offset the basic
properties of the system. We derive model-independent bounds on some crucial
time-scales, such as the times of gate operation, decoherence, maximal
entanglement and total scrambling. We show that for black hole type quantum
computers all these time-scales are of the order of the black hole half-life
time. Furthermore, we construct explicitly a set of Hamiltonians that generates
a universal set of quantum gates for the black hole type computer. We find that
the gates work at maximal energy efficiency. Furthermore, we establish a
fundamental bound on the complexity of quantum circuits encoded on these
systems, and characterize the unitary operations that are implementable. It
becomes apparent that the computational power is very limited due to the fact
that the black hole life-time is of the same order of the gate operation time.
As a consequence, it is impossible to retrieve its information, within the
life-time of a black hole, by externally coupling to the black hole qubits.
However, we show that, in principle, coupling to some of the internal degrees
of freedom allows acquiring knowledge about the micro-state. Still, due to the
trivial complexity of operations that can be performed, there is no time
advantage over the collection of Hawking radiation and subsequent decoding.

cannot be described in terms of conventional physical propagating photons with
two transverse polarizations, and instead emerge as a result of tunneling
transitions between topologically different but physically identical vacuum
winding states. These new terms give an extra contribution to the Casimir

physical photons will be emitted from the vacuum, similar to the dynamical
Casimir effect (DCE) where photons are radiated from the vacuum due to
time-dependent boundary conditions. We propose an experimental realization of
such small effects using a microwave cavity. We also comment on the possible

recovered by action on Bob's system alone. This gives a condition for
approximate quantum error correction in terms of the recoverability of

of efficient quantum polar codes. I also find a tight relation on the guessing

conductance bandwidth of the ensemble averaged transmission as well as the
total current increases with the number of fermions $n$ in the network and is
maximal for $k \sim n/2$. The transmission is peaked around the band center for
$k=n$ making the transport efficient in a narrow energy band. We show that for
all parameters the transport is enhanced significantly if only centrosymmetric
ensembles (csEGE) are considered. In this case the transmission shows numerous
resonances of perfect transport. Analyzing the transmission by spectral
decomposition, we find that centrosymmetry induces strong correlations and
enhances the extrema of the distributions. This suppresses destructive

transmission resonances which enhance the overall transport.

promising approach is to use hybrid electromechanical systems incorporating
superconducting qubits and microwave circuitry. However, a critical challenge
facing the development of these systems is to achieve strong coupling between
mechanics and qubits while simultaneously reducing coupling of both the qubit
and mechanical mode to the environment. Here we report measurements of a
qubit-coupled mechanical resonator system consisting of an ultra-high-frequency
nanoresonator and a long coherence-time superconducting transmon qubit,
embedded in superconducting coplanar waveguide cavity. It is demonstrated that
the nanoresonator and transmon have commensurate energies and transmon
coherence times are one order of magnitude larger than for all previously
reported qubit-coupled nanoresonators. Moreover, we show that numerical
simulations of this new hybrid quantum system are in good agreement with
spectroscopic measurements and suggest that the nanoresonator in our device
resides at low thermal occupation number, near its ground state, acting as a
dissipative bath seen by the qubit. We also outline how this system could soon

direct relevance to quantum information processing and quantum thermodynamics,
including the study of nanoresonator quantum noise properties, reservoir

equations of motion in such a system and by using the von Neumann entropy, the
degree of entanglement (DEM) could be measured in semi classical regime and in
the multi-photon resonance condition. We interested in investigating the
maximum value for DEM and controlled the DEM via relative phase. At first we
consider three laser fields as CW optical laser fields and one femtosecond
Gaussian field. In this case DEM has interesting behavior. When the system is
applied by the other laser fields and Gaussian pulse is still there DEM can be
controlled via phase but after finishing the time duration of the femtosecond
Gaussian pulse DEM will be phase independent. Then we consider all the laser
fields as femtosecond Gaussian pulses which interact with atomic system and we
achieve to this point that the steady state entanglement can be occurred by
using such ultra-short laser pulses; in this situation DEM will be phase
independent. The system would be disentangled in special parameters of Rabi
frequencies and all the atoms are coherently populated in a dark state in
dressed state picture. Moreover when the system is entangled, there is a
population distribution of the atoms in dressed states.

solutions of the time-dependent Schr\&quot;odinger equation provide useful physical
insight. This is not the case for relativistic quantum mechanics, however, for
which both the Klein-Gordon and Dirac wave equations result in strange and
counterintuitive wavepacket behaviors, even for free-particle Gaussians. These
behaviors include zitterbewegung and other interference effects. As a potential
remedy, this paper explores a new trajectory-based formulation of quantum
mechanics, in which the wavefunction plays no role [Phys. Rev. X, 4, 040002
(2014)]. Quantum states are represented as ensembles of trajectories, whose
mutual interaction is the source of all quantum effects observed in
nature---suggesting a &quot;many interacting worlds&quot; interpretation. It is shown
that the relativistic generalization of the trajectory-based formulation
results in well-behaved free-particle Gaussian wavepacket solutions. In
particular, probability density is positive and well-localized everywhere, and
its spatial integral is conserved over time---in any inertial frame. Finally,
the ensemble-averaged wavepacket motion is along a straight line path through
spacetime. In this manner, the pathologies of the wave-based relativistic
quantum theory, as applied to wavepacket propagation, are avoided.

  Dimension</title><description>  We prove that estimating the smallest eigenvalue of a
translationally-invariant, nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian on a 1D chain of
quantum systems is QMAEXP-complete, even for systems of low dimension. This
improves on the work by Gottesman and Irani (2009), where this dimension was
several orders of magnitude larger, whereas our dimension is comparable to the
best-known non-translationally-invariant result by Hallgren et al. (2013). The
main novelty of our work is the introduction of a new approach to encoding
quantum computation in the ground state of a local Hamiltonian, and for
analyzing its ground state energy. While previous constructions directly
encoded one of the standard models, we introduce a new Turing-complete model of
quantum computation - a quantum ring machine. We then translate the ring
machine of a QMAEXP verifier into another new model - a quantum Thue system.
This hybrid classical-quantum model is an extension of string rewriting systems
and is specifically tailored to encoding quantum computation in a
nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian with translationally-invariant interactions. This
allows us to shift the proof burden from simplifying the Hamiltonians used to
encode a standard computational model, to proving universality of a very
simplified model. While previous constructions could accommodate only serial
computation, quantum Thue systems allow for non-determinism and concurrency.
This requires more sophisticated techniques for analyzing the spectrum of the
resulting Hamiltonian: we relate it to the Laplacian of a graph with unitary
edge weights. To capture the non-deterministic branching in the computational
path, we allow arbitrary graphs, including ones with cycles, which goes beyond
path graphs considered in all previous constructions.

the effects of charge noise that currently limit the coherence of gate

that has been applied to spins and propose a DFS for charge that protects
solid-state qubits from uniform electric field fluctuations during gating
operations. The logical qubit is formed from states with charge distributions
that differ but have the same center of mass, and are decoupled from leakage

  Satellite-based Channels</title><description>  In this work we investigate the effectiveness of continuous-variable (CV)
entangled states, transferred through high-loss atmospheric channels, as a
means of viable quantum key distribution (QKD) between terrestrial stations and
low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. In particular, we investigate the role played
by the Gaussian CV states as compared to non-Gaussian states. We find that
beam-wandering induced atmospheric losses lead to QKD performance levels that
are in general quite different from those found in fixed-attenuation channels.
For example, circumstances can be found where no QKD is viable at some fixed
loss in fiber but is viable at the same mean loss in fading channels. We also
find that, in some circumstances, the QKD relative performance of Gaussian and
non-Gaussian states can in atmospheric channels be the reverse of that found in
fixed-attenuation channels. These findings show that the nature of the
atmospheric channel can have a large impact on the QKD performance. Our results
should prove useful for emerging global quantum communications that use LEO
satellites as communication relays.

Evidence
from particle physics shows that there is a different version of the
Hamiltonian for each direction of time. As there is no physical basis for the
universe to be asymmetric in time, both versions must operate equally. However,
conventional physical theories accommodate only one version of the Hamiltonian
and one direction of time. This represents an unexplained anomaly in
conventional physics and calls for a reworking of the concepts of time and
space. Here I explain how the anomaly can be resolved by allowing dynamics to
emerge phenomenologically. The resolution offers a picture of time and space
that lies below our everyday experience, and one in which their differences are
epiphenomenal rather than elemental.

  cavity</title><description>  We explore the asymmetric sequential Landau-Zener (LZ) dynamics in an
ensemble of interacting Bose condensed two-level atoms coupled with a cavity
field. Assuming the couplings between all atoms and the cavity field are
identical, the interplay between atom-atom interaction and detuning may lead to
a series of LZ transitions. Unlike the conventional sequential LZ transitions,
which are symmetric to the zero detuning, the LZ transitions of Bose condensed
atoms in a cavity field are asymmetric and sensitively depend on the photon
number distribution of the cavity. In LZ processes involving single excitation
numbers, both the variance of the relative atom number and the step slope of
the sequential population ladder are asymmetric, and the asymmetry become more
significant for smaller excitation numbers. Furthermore, in LZ processes
involving multiple excitation numbers, there may appear asymmetric population
ladders with decreasing step heights. During a dynamical LZ process, due to the
atom-cavity coupling, the cavity field shows dynamical collapse and revivals.
In comparison with the symmetric LZ transitions in a classical field, the
asymmetric LZ transitions in a cavity field originate from the
photon-number-dependent Rabi frequency. The asymmetric sequential LZ dynamics
of Bose condensed atoms in a cavity field may open up a new way to explore the
fundamental many-body physics in coupled atom-photon systems.

effects of a class of extensions to quantum theory which are expected to result
from quantum gravity, and is such that wavefunction collapse is a physical
process. The rate of such a process could be very much lower than the upper
bounds set by searches to date, and yet still modify greatly the interpretation
of quantum mechanics and solve the quantum measurement problem. Consequently
experiments are sought to explore this. We describe an experiment that has the
potential to extend sensitivity to CSL by many orders of magnitude. The method
is to detect heating of the motion of charged macroscopic objects confined in a
Paul trap. We discuss the detection and the chief noise sources. We find that
CSL with standard parameters could be observed using a vibration-isolated ion

motion in all physical systems. This effect is very weak, but experimental
progress in creating ultracold atomic systems can be used to detect it. In this
paper, we considered a recent experiment [1], where an atomic ensemble was
cooled down to picokelvins. Any Brownian motion induces an extra increase of
the position variance of the gas. We study this effect by solving the dynamical
equations for the Continuous Spontaneous Localizations (CSL) model, as well as
for its non-Markovian and dissipative extensions. The resulting bounds, with a
95% of confidence level, are beaten only by measurements of spontaneous X-ray
emission and by experiments with cantilever (in the latter case, only for rC &gt;
10^(-7) m, where rC is one of the two collapse parameters of the CSL model). We
show that, contrary to the bounds given by X-ray measurements, non-Markovian
effects do not change the bounds, for any reasonable choice of a frequency
cutoff in the spectrum of the collapse noise. Therefore the bounds here
considered are more robust. We also show that dissipative effects are
unimportant for a large spectrum of temperatures of the noise, while for low
temperatures the excluded region in the parameter space is the more reduced,
the lower the temperature.

considering a source that emits particles in a default state, until a point
where it switches to another state. Given a sequence of particles emitted by
the source, the problem is to find out where the change occurred. For large
sequences, we obtain an analytical expression for the maximum probability of
correctly identifying the change point when joint measurements on the whole

individually and provide an online answer as soon as a new particle is emitted
by the source. We show that these strategies substantially underperform the
optimal strategy, indicating that quantum sudden changes, although happening
locally, are better detected globally.

conductor couples capacitively to one arm of the interferometer and causes a
phase shift which is proportional to the number of transferred charges.
Importantly, the full counting statistics can be obtained from average current
measurements at the outputs of the interferometer. The counting field can be
controlled by varying the time delay between two separate voltage signals
applied to the conductor and the interferometer, respectively. As a specific

partitioning electrons on a quantum point contact. Our scheme is robust against
moderate environmental dephasing and can be realized thanks to recent advances

(where each line has just two points), one can associate with it a Veldkamp
space. Focusing on extended Dynkin diagrams of type $\widetilde{D}_n$, $4 \leq
n \leq 8$, it is shown that the corresponding Veldkamp space always contains a
distinguished copy of the projective space PG$(3,2)$. Proper labelling of the
vertices of the diagram (for $4 \leq n \leq 7$) by particular elements of the
two-qubit Pauli group establishes a bijection between the 15 elements of the
group and the 15 points of the PG$(3,2)$. The bijection is such that the
product of three elements lying on the same line is the identity and one also
readily singles out that particular copy of the symplectic polar space $W(3,2)$
of the PG$(3,2)$ whose lines correspond to triples of mutually commuting
elements of the group; in the latter case, in addition, we arrive at a unique
copy of the Mermin-Peres magic square. In the case of $n=8$, a more natural
labeling is that in terms of elements of the three-qubit Pauli group,
furnishing a bijection between the 63 elements of the group and the 63 points
of PG$(5,2)$, the latter being the maximum projective subspace of the
corresponding Veldkamp space; here, the points of the distinguished PG$(3,2)$
are in a bijection with the elements of a two-qubit subgroup of the three-qubit
Pauli group, yielding a three-qubit version of the Mermin-Peres square.
Moreover, save for $n=4$, each Veldkamp space is also endowed with some
`exceptional' point(s). Interestingly, two such points in the $n=8$ case define
a unique Fano plane whose inherited three-qubit labels feature solely the Pauli
matrix $Y$.

states over W*-algebras (generalised spaces of density matrices) may be used to
substantially enrich the description of quantum dynamics in the algebraic and
path integral approaches; 2) discuss a framework for postquantum information
theories, such that quantum mechanical linearity holds only locally, while the
nonlocal multi-user dynamics exhibits some similarity with general relativity.
In the algebraic setting, we propose a method of incorporating nonlinear
Poisson and relative entropic local dynamics, as well as local gauge and local
source structures, into an effective description of local temporal evolution of
quantum states by using fibrewise perturbations of liouvilleans in the fibre
bundle of Hilbert spaces. In the path integral setting, we incorporate local
geometry by a generalisation of the Daubechies--Klauder coherent state phase
space propagator formula. Finally, we discuss the role of Bregman relative
entropy in the Jaynes--Mitchell--Favretti renormalisation scheme. As a result,
we show that: 1) the propagation of quantum particles (in Wigner's sense) can
be naturally explained as a free fall along the trajectories locally minimising
the quantum relative entropy; 2) the contribution of particular trajectories to
the global path integral is weighted by the local quantum entropic prior,
measuring user's lack of information; 3) the presence of nonlinear quantum
control variables results in the change of the curvature of the global quantum
state space; 4) the behaviour of zero-point energy under renormalisation of
local entropic dynamics is maintained by local redefinition of information mass
(prior), which encodes the curvature change. This leads us to a new framework
for nonequilibrium quantum statistical mechanics based on quantum Orlicz

general restricts the set of possible correlations between them. This
relationship can be mediated by unobserved systems, which correspond to random
variables in the classical case and shared density operators in the quantum
case. Here we investigate the use of entropy vectors - vectors whose components
correspond to the entropies of each subset of the observed variables - as a
means to differentiate between the classical and quantum cases of particular
causal structures. We use non-Shannon entropic inequalities to give additional
constraints on the sets of possible entropy vectors in the classical case and
hence obtain tighter outer approximations of the set of realisable entropy
vectors. We also discuss how to obtain inner approximations.
  We provide several examples and analyse the triangle causal structure in
detail. In most causal structures where it is unknown whether or not there is a
classical-quantum separation in terms of entropy vectors, non-Shannon
inequalities give a tighter characterisation in the classical case. The
question of whether these improved characterisations also hold in the quantum
case remains open, i.e., we remain without an example of an entropy vector that
is attainable in a quantum causal structure, but not in the classical analogue.
These techniques may also shed light on the question of whether non-Shannon
inequalities also hold for the von Neumann entropy.

the state is pure, and more generally that its rank is bounded by a given value
$r$. In this scenario two notions of informationally complete measurements
emerge: rank-$r$ complete measurements and rank-$r$ strictly-complete
measurements. Whereas in the first notion, a rank-$r$ state is uniquely
identified from within the set of rank-$r$ states, in the second notion the
same state is uniquely identified from within the set of all physical states,
of any rank. We argue, therefore, that strictly-complete measurements are
compatible with convex optimization, and we prove that they allow robust
quantum state estimation in the presence of experimental noise. We also show
that rank-$r$ strictly-complete measurements are as efficient as rank-$r$
complete measurements. We construct examples of strictly-complete measurements
and give a complete description of their structure in the context of matrix
completion. Moreover, we numerically show that a few random bases form such
measurements. We demonstrate the efficiency-robustness property for different
strictly-complete measurements with numerical experiments. We thus conclude
that only strictly-complete measurements are useful for practical tomography.

However, the realization of quantum computers is associated with significant
technological challenges in achieving and preserving quantum entanglement.
Prime factorization can be also solved by using classical wave interference
without quantum entanglement. In this work, we present experimental data
showing prime factorization by utilizing spin wave interference. The prime
factorization includes three major steps. First, general type computer
calculates the sequence of numbers mkmod(N), where N is the number to be
factorized, m is a randomly chosen positive integer, and k=0,1,2,3,4,5,6 .. .
Next, the period of calculated sequence r is determined by exploiting spin wave
interference. Finally, the general type computer finds the primes based on the
obtained r. The experiment on the period finding was accomplished on the
6-terminal Y3Fe2(FeO4)3 device. We chose number 15 for a test and found its
primes in a sequence of measurements. The obtained data demonstrate an example
of solving a prime factorization problem using classical wave interference. We
discuss the physical and technological limitations of this approach, which
define the maximum size of N and the computational speed. Though this classical
approach cannot compete with the quantum algorithm in efficiency, magnonic
holographic devices can be potentially utilized as complementary logic units
aimed to speed up prime factorization with classical computers.

  presence of cross-Kerr nonlinearity</title><description>  The interaction of two quantized fields and three-level quantum system in a
lambda-type configuration is investigated in the presence of cross-Kerr
nonlinearity. We consider three models of coupling for the atom-photon
interaction. First, we study the dynamical behavior of the atom-photon
entanglement and show that increasing the cross-Kerr nonlinearity results in
different behaviors in three considered models. Moreover, it is demonstrated
that the two quantized modes can be entangled, on the other hand, by applying a
classical driving field to the lower levels. Increasing the classical driving
field destroys the long time atom-photon entanglement. Our results show that an
oscillatory two-mode squeezing can be generated in the absence of a driving
classical field and the cross-Kerr nonlinearity.

Choi-Kraus operators. We further show that any operator subspace can be
obtained from two quantum operations in such a way. This connection enables us
to study the parallel distinguishability of operator subspaces directly without
explicitly referring to the underlining quantum operations. We obtain a
necessary and sufficient condition for the parallel distinguishability of an
operator subspace that is either one-dimensional or Hermitian. In both cases
the condition is equivalent to the non-existence of positive definite operator
in the subspace, and an optimal discrimination protocol is obtained. Finally,
we provide more examples to show that the non-existence of positive definite

Rev. Lett. 116, 110403 (2016)] have proven that though a universal quantum
machine that creates superposition of arbitrary two unknown states is
physically impossible, a probabilistic protocol exists in the case of two input

to test this protocol by comparing the reconstructed output state with
theoretical expected superposition of input states. We obtain the average

  model</title><description>  We present a new exactly solvable (classical and quantum) model that can be
interpreted as the generalization to the two-dimensional sphere and to the
hyperbolic space of the two-dimensional anisotropic oscillator with any pair of
frequencies $\omega_x$ and $\omega_y$. The new curved Hamiltonian ${H}_\kappa$
depends on the curvature $\kappa$ of the underlying space as a
deformation/contraction parameter, and the Liouville integrability of
${H}_\kappa$ relies on its separability in terms of geodesic parallel
coordinates, which generalize the Cartesian coordinates of the plane. Moreover,
the system is shown to be superintegrable for commensurate frequencies
$\omega_x: \omega_y$, thus mimicking the behaviour of the flat Euclidean case,
which is always recovered in the $\kappa\to 0$ limit. The additional constant
of motion in the commensurate case is, as expected, of higher-order in the
momenta and can be explicitly deduced by performing the classical factorization
of the Hamiltonian. The known $1:1$ and $2:1$ anisotropic curved oscillators
are recovered as particular cases of ${H}_\kappa$, meanwhile all the remaining
$\omega_x: \omega_y$ curved oscillators define new superintegrable systems.
Furthermore, the quantum Hamiltonian $\hat {H}_\kappa$ is fully constructed and
studied by following a quantum factorization approach. In the case of
commensurate frequencies, the Hamiltonian $\hat {H}_\kappa$ turns out to be
quantum superintegrable and leads to a new exactly solvable quantum model. Its
corresponding spectrum, that exhibits a maximal degeneracy, is explicitly given
as an analytical deformation of the Euclidean eigenvalues in terms of both the
curvature $\kappa$ and the Planck constant $\hbar$. In fact, such spectrum is
obtained as a composition of two one-dimensional (either trigonometric or
hyperbolic) P\&quot;osch-Teller set of eigenvalues.

becomes important for us to create more number coherent quantum states between
two labs from a given coherent state shared initially. We call this process as
\textbf{Broadcasting of Quantum Coherence (QCh)}. In this work we extensively
study the problem of broadcasting of QCh. In order to have a holistic view of
broadcasting, we start with a most general representation two qubit mixed state
in terms of Bloch vectors. As a cloning transformation we have used both state
dependent and independent version of universal symmetric optimal Buzek-Hillery

in case of non optimal broadcasting it is impossible to increase QCh of the

consider examples like, a) Werner like states and b) Bell diagonal states and
obtain ranges for broadcasting in terms of input state parameters.

Applying the semiclassical dynamics for quasiparticles which are accelerated

traces the motion of node charges on the islands of the circuit. However, for
some devices, the relevant physics can be best described by the motion of
polarization charges over the branches of the circuit that are in general
related to the node charges in a highly nonlocal way. Here, we present a
method, dual to the conventional approach, for quantizing planar circuits in
terms of loop charges. In this way, the polarization charges are directly
obtained as the differences of the two loop charges on the neighboring loops.
The loop charges trace the motion of fluxes through the circuit loops. We show
that loop charges yield a simple description of the flux transport across
phase-slip junctions. We outline a concrete construction of circuits based on
phase-slip junctions that are electromagnetically dual to arbitrary planar
Josephson junction circuits. We argue that loop charges also yield a simple
description of the flux transport in conventional Josephson junctions shunted
by large impedances. We show that a mixed circuit description in terms of node
fluxes and loop charges yields an insight into the flux decompactification of a
Josephson junction shunted by an inductor. As an application, we show that the
fluxonium qubit is well approximated as a phase-slip junction for the
experimentally relevant parameters. Moreover, we argue that the $0$-$\pi$ qubit

based on magic state distillation that assumes the availability of the ternary
Clifford gates, projective measurements, classical control and (ii) a model
based on a metaplectic topological quantum computer (MTQC). Arguably, a natural
choice to implement Shor's algorithm on a ternary quantum computer is to
translate the entire arithmetic into a ternary form. However, it is also
possible to simply emulate the standard binary version of the algorithm by
encoding each qubit in a three level system. In this paper we address this
emulation approach and analyze the complexity of implementing Shor's period
finding function in both models, (i) and (ii).We compare the costs in terms of
magic state counts required in each mode and find that a binary emulation
implementation of Shor's algorithm on a ternary quantum computer requires
slightly smaller circuit depth than the corresponding implementation in the
binary Clifford$+T$ framework. The reason for this are simplifications for
binary arithmetic that can be leveraged over ternary gate sets. We also
highlight that magic state preparation on MTQC requires magic state
preprocessor of asymptotically smaller size which gives the MTQC solution a

adsorbates are predicted to exhibit an exponential sensitivity to local surface
curvature, leading to either a large net enhancement or suppression over smooth
surfaces. For typical experimental parameters, orders-of-magnitude variations
in total heating rates can occur depending on the spatial distribution of
absorbates. Through careful engineering of electrode surface profiles, our
results suggests that heating rates can be tuned over orders of magnitudes.

quantum information theory for non-specialist. Transmitting an information is a
fundamental technology. However, there are several demands for this
transmission. The research area to study such problems is called information
theory. In the information transmission, the information is transmitted via a
physical media. Hence, the analysis of this problem might depends on the
property of the physical media. Indeed, while it is ideal that the analysis
does not depend on this property, it depends on the following classification of
the physical media. Currently, we have two kinds of physical objects, the first
one is a macroscopic object, i.e., an object subject to classical physics, and
the second one is a microscopic object, i.e., an object subject to quantum
physics. Since these two objects have completely different behaviors, we need
to build up information theory dependently of these two information media. That
is, we have classical information theory and quantum information theory. In
both information theory, there are very elegant theoretical results with an
ideal assumption. That is, we often assume that infinitely large size of the
system is available while the real situation does not satisfy this assumption.
Hence, to discuss the real case, we need to care about the finite size effect
of the system size. This paper reviews this finite size effect in classical and
quantum information theory with respect to various topics.

  noise</title><description>  Along with weaving together observations, experiments, and theoretical
constructs into a coherent mesh of understanding of the world around us,
physics over its past five centuries has continuously refined the base concepts
on which the whole framework is built. In quantum physics, first in
non-relativistic mechanics and later in quantum field theories, even familiar
concepts of position, momentum, wave or particle, are derived constructs from
the classical limit in which we live but not intrinsic to the underlying
physics. Most crucially, the very idea of the individual, whether an object or
an event, distinguished only in a mere label of identity from others identical
to it in all the physics, exists only as an approximation, not an element of
underlying reality. Failure to recognize this and seeking alternative
explanations in many worlds or multiverses leads only to incoherent logic and
incorrect physics.
  As an example, in a physical system such as an atom in a particular state,
physics deals with the universal system of all such atoms but makes no
meaningful prediction of the position of an electron or the time of decay of
any specific atom. Those are incidental, entirely random among all possible
positions and times, even while physics makes very precise predictions for the
distribution of the outcomes in measurements on atoms in that state. Physics
deals with the universal, not the individual.

unstable continuum, i.e. a continuum of states comprising energies with
positive imaginary part, is theoretically investigated. As compared to quantum
decay in an Hermitian continuum, in the non-Hermitian case a richer scenario
can be found as a result of non-unitary dynamics. Different behaviors are
observed depending on the kind of instability of the continuum. These include
complete or fractional decay in convectively-unstable continua, the absence of
quantum decay for a bound state with energy embedded in the continuum loop, and
unstable (secular) growth with pseudo exponential amplification in the
absolutely-unstable regime. Analytical results are presented for a
nearest-neighboring tight-binding continuum with asymmetric hopping rates
$\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, which shows a transition from convective to absolute
instability when the sign $\kappa_1 \kappa_2$ changes from positive to
negative. In the convectively unstable regime the model describes the decay of
a bound state coupled to a tight-binding lattice with an imaginary gauge field,
which shows a pseudo-Hermitian dynamics. In the absolutely-unstable regime,
pseudo-Hermitian dynamics is broken and a pseudo exponential secular growth is
observed.

electric mechanism to interfere its electron orbits. Owing to the existence of
spin-orbit coupling and a pulsed electric field, different spin-orbit states
are shown to interfere with each other, generating intriguing
interference-resonant patterns. We also reveal that an in-plane magnetic field
does not affect the strength interval of any neighboring resonant peaks, but
contributes a weak shift of each peak, which is sensitive to the direction of
the magnetic field. We find that this proposed external-field-controlled scheme
should be regarded as a new type of quantum-dot-based interferometry. Finally,
this interferometry has an important application in precisely measuring

inequality is expressed in terms of pseudo-spin operators and quantum
expectation values are calculated for generic two-mode squeezed states
characterized by a squeezing parameter $r$ and a squeezing angle $\varphi$.
Allowing for generic values of the squeezing angle is especially relevant when
$\varphi$ is not under experimental control, such as in cosmic inflation, where
small quantum fluctuations in the early Universe are responsible for structures
formation. Compared to previous studies restricted to $\varphi=0$ and to a
fixed orientation of the pseudo-spin operators, allowing for $\varphi\neq 0$
and optimizing the angular configuration leads to a completely new and rich
phenomenology. Two dual schemes of approximation are designed that allow for
comprehensive exploration of the squeezing parameters space. In particular, it
is found that Bell's inequality can be violated when the squeezing parameter
$r$ is large enough, $r\gtrsim 1.12$, and the squeezing angle $\varphi$ is
small enough, $\varphi\lesssim 0.34\,e^{-r}$.

  Thermodynamic properties</title><description>  A theoretical analysis of the thermodynamic properties of the Robin wall
characterized by the extrapolation length $\Lambda$ in the electric field
$\mathscr{E}$ that pushes the particle to the surface is presented both in the
canonical and two grand canonical representations and in the whole range of the
Robin distance with the emphasis on its negative values which for the
voltage-free configuration support negative-energy bound state. For the
canonical ensemble, the heat capacity at $\Lambda&lt;0$ exhibits a nonmonotonic
behavior as a function of the temperature $T$ with its pronounced maximum
unrestrictedly increasing for the decreasing fields as $\ln^2\mathscr{E}$ and
its location being proportional to $(-\ln\mathscr{E})^{-1}$. For the
Fermi-Dirac distribution, the specific heat per particle $c_N$ is a
nonmonotonic function of the temperature too with the conspicuous extremum
being preceded on the $T$ axis by the plateau whose magnitude at the vanishing
$\mathscr{E}$ is defined as $3(N-1)/(2N)k_B$, with $N$ being a number of the
particles. The maximum of $c_N$ is the largest for $N=1$ and, similar to the
canonical ensemble, grows to infinity as the field goes to zero. For the
Bose-Einstein ensemble, a formation of the sharp asymmetric feature on the
$c_N$-$T$ dependence with the increase of $N$ is shown to be more prominent at
the lower voltages. This cusp-like dependence of the heat capacity on the
temperature, which for the infinite number of bosons transforms into the
discontinuity of $c_N(T)$, is an indication of the phase transition to the
condensate state. Qualitative and quantitative explanation of these physical
phenomena is based on the variation of the energy spectrum by the electric
field.

  spectrum, polarization and quantum-information measures</title><description>  Information-theoretical concepts are employed for the analysis of the
interplay between a transverse electric field $\mathscr{E}$ applied to a
one-dimensional surface and Robin boundary condition (BC), which with the help
of the extrapolation length $\Lambda$ zeroes at the interface a linear
combination of the quantum mechanical wave function and its spatial derivative,
and its influence on the properties of the structure. For doing this, exact
analytical solutions of the corresponding Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation are derived
and used for calculating energies, dipole moments, position $S_x$ and momentum
$S_k$ quantum information entropies and their Fisher information $I_x$ and
$I_k$ and Onicescu information energies $O_x$ and $O_k$ counterparts. It is
shown that the weak (strong) electric field changes the Robin wall into the
Dirichlet, $\Lambda=0$ (Neumann, $\Lambda=\infty$), surface. This
transformation of the energy spectrum and associated waveforms in the growing
field defines an evolution of the quantum-information measures; for example, it
is proved that for the Dirichlet and Neumann BCs the position (momentum)
quantum information entropy varies as a positive (negative) natural logarithm
of the electric intensity what results in their field-independent sum
$S_x+S_k$. Analogously, at $\Lambda=0$ and $\Lambda=\infty$ the position and
momentum Fisher informations (Onicescu energies) depend on the applied voltage
as $\mathscr{E}^{2/3}$ ($\mathscr{E}^{1/3}$) and its inverse, respectively,
leading to the field-independent product $I_xI_k$ ($O_xO_k$). Peculiarities of
their transformations at the finite nonzero $\Lambda$ are discussed and
similarities and differences between the three quantum-information measures in
the electric field are highlighted with the special attention being paid to the
configuration with the negative extrapolation length.

decay rate depends on the difference of scattering amplitudes for different
rotational configurations, leading to the gradual loss of quantum coherence
between the pointer states in the system orientational space. For a dielectric
ellipsoid immersed in a photon-gas environment (assuming no absorption), the
decay rate is found to be proportional to the seventh power of the temperature.
For an ellipsoidal object interacting with mass particles, the decay rate is
proportional to the 5/2 power of the temperature. Both are different from the

For photon scattering, the coherence time in the rotational degrees of freedom

mathematically-proven secure key for quantum cryptography. The distributed
secret key rate is limited by the bandwidth of the nonlinear resonators used
for entanglement generation, which is less than 100 MHz for current
state-of-the-art setups. The development of an entanglement source with a
higher bandwidth promises an increased measurement speed and a linear boost in
the secure data rate. Here, we present the experimental realization of a
continuous-variable entanglement source with a bandwidth of more than 1.25 GHz.
The measured entanglement spectrum was quantified via the inseparability
criterion introduced by Duan and coworkers with a critical value of 4 below
which entanglement is certified. The measurements yielded an inseparability
value of about 1.8 at a frequency of 300 MHz to about 2.8 at 1.2 GHz extending
further to about 3.1 at 1.48 GHz. In the experiment we used two 2.6 mm long
monolithic PPKTP crystal resonators to generate two squeezed fields at the
telecommunication wavelength of 1550 nm. The experimentally achieved
entanglement strength was mainly limited by the total optical detection
efficiency of 59% in the set-up as well as by the injected pump power of the
nonlinear process for the entanglement generation.

mechanics, based on the idea of replacing the usual time operator $\mathbf{T}$
with a suitable real-valued function $T$ on the space of physical states. The
proper characterization of the function $T$ relies on a particular relation
with the dynamical evolution of the system rather than with the infinitesimal
generator of the dynamics (Hamiltonian). We first consider the case of
classical Hamiltonian mechanics, where observables are functions on phase space
and the tools of differential geometry can be applied. The idea is then
extended to the case of the unitary evolution of pure states of finite-level
quantum systems by means of the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics. It
is found that $T$ is a function on the space of pure states which is not
associated to any self-adjoint operator. The link between $T$ and the dynamical
evolution is interpreted as defining a simultaneity relation for the states of
the system with respect to the dynamical evolution itself. It turns out that
different dynamical evolutions lead to different notions of simultaneity, i.e.,
the notion of simultaneity is a dynamical notion.

annealing have made prototypical annealing optimizers with hundreds of qubits
commercially available. The experimental demonstration of a quantum speedup for
optimization problems has since then become a coveted, albeit elusive goal.
Recent studies have shown that the so far inconclusive results as to the
appearance of such quantum enhancements, may have been partly due to the
benchmark problems used being unsuitable, allowing for both traditional
resources and quantum annealers to solve them with no special efforts. The need
therefore has arisen for the generation of harder benchmarks which would
hopefully possess the discriminative power to separate classical scaling of
performance with size, from quantum. We introduce here a practical technique
for the engineering of extremely hard spin glass Ising-type problem instances
that does not require `cherry picking' from large ensembles of randomly
generated instances. We accomplish this by treating the generation of hard
optimization problems itself as an optimization problem, for which we offer a
heuristic algorithm that solves it. We demonstrate the genuine thermal hardness
of our generated instances by examining them thermodynamically and analyzing
their energy landscapes, as well as by testing the performance of various
state-of-the art algorithms on them. We argue that a proper characterization of
the generated instances offers a practical, efficient way to properly benchmark
experimental quantum annealers, as well as any other optimization algorithm.

continous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD), both for performance and
security reasons. As a consequence, next-generation CV- QKD systems will have
to be implemented with a local local oscillator (LLO). This issue has been
explicitly tackled in recent works, where the proposed and implemented
approach, that we call LLO-sequential, consists in sequentially (temporally)
multiplexing quantum signal optical pulses with phase reference pilot tones
optical pulses. We develop a comprehensive analysis of the noise model and the
hardware requirements in order to perform LLO CV-QKD. This analysis allows to
quantitatively understand one of the limits of CV-QKD implemented with the
LLO-sequential approach: such systems, unless operated at very high speed, have
very strong requirements in terms of tolerable laser phase noise.
LLO-sequential CV-QKD can thus in practice only be implemented with expensive,
low phase noise lasers, such as ECL lasers. The main contribution of this work
is to introduce designs for LLO CV-QKD based on self-coherence phase sharing,
in which the phase reference information and the quantum information are
coherently obtained from a single optical wavefront. We propose in particular a
design, called LLO-displacement, where the phase reference information is
encoded in the displacement of the standard CV-QKD Gaussian modulated coherent
state (GMCS) protocol. We analyze the performance and the hardware requirements
of the LLO-displacement design and our results indicate that it can be used to
perform CV-QKD over distances up to 100 km with realistic and affordable
hardware, in particular with standard telecom equipment and low cost DFB
lasers. This opens a practical path towards the development of coherent quantum
communications systems compatible with next-generation networks requirements.

not hold in general, i.e. its nonzero value does not necessarily imply presence

We also evaluate the difference between maximum global and local extractable
work for arbitrary states when the system is no longer isolated but put in

for characterizing entanglement, has been extensively employed to explore
quantum phase transitions (QPTs). Although the conventional single-site
mean-field (MF) approach successfully predicts the emergence of QPTs, it fails
to include any entanglement. Here, for the first time, in the framework of a
cluster MF treatment, we extract the signature of EE in the bosonic
superfluid-insulator transitions. We consider a trimerized Kagome lattice of
interacting bosons, in which each trimer is treated as a cluster, and implement
the cluster MF treatment by decoupling all inter-trimer hopping. In addition to
superfluid and integer insulator phases, we find that fractional insulator
phases appear when the tunneling is dominated by the intra-trimer part. To
quantify the residual bipartite entanglement in a cluster, we calculate the
second-order Renyi entropy, which can be experimentally measured by quantum
interference of many-body twins. The second-order Renyi entropy itself is
continuous everywhere, however, the continuousness of its first-order
derivative breaks down at the phase boundary. This means that the bosonic
superfluid-insulator transitions can still be efficiently captured by the
residual entanglement in our cluster MF treatment. Besides to the bosonic
superfluid-insulator transitions, our cluster MF treatment may also be used to
capture the signature of EE for other QPTs in quantum superlattice models.

  Problems</title><description>  Many tasks in modern life, such as efficient traveling, image processing and
integrated circuit optimization, are modeled as complex combinatorial
optimization problems. Such problems can be mapped to finding a ground state of
the Ising Hamiltonian, thus various physical systems have been studied to
emulate and solve this Ising problem. Recently, networks of mutually injected
optical oscillators, called coherent Ising machines, have been developed as
promising solvers for the problem, benefiting from programmability, scalability
and room temperature operation. Here, we report a 16-bit coherent Ising machine
with a network of time-division-multiplexed femtosecond degenerate optical
parametric oscillators. The system experimentally gives more than 99.6 % of
success rates for one-dimensional Ising ring and nondeterministic
polynomial-time (NP) hard instances. The experimental and numerical results
indicate that gradual pumping of the network combined with multimode dynamics
of femtosecond pulses can improve its computational performance, offering a new
path for tackling more complex instances.

  optimization problems</title><description>  Quantum annealing may provide advantages over simulated annealing on solving
some problems such as Kth order binary optimization problem. No feasible
architecture exists to implement the high-order optimization problem (K &gt; 2) on
current quantum annealing hardware. We propose a two-dimensional quantum
annealing architecture to solve the 4th order binary optimization problem by
encoding four-qubit interactions within the coupled local fields acting on a
set of physical qubits. All possible four-body coupling terms for an N-qubit
system can be implemented through this architecture and are readily realizable
with the existing superconducting circuit technologies. The overhead of the
physical qubits is O(N4), which is the same as previously proposed
architectures in four-dimensional space. The equivalence between the
optimization problem Hamiltonian and the executable Hamiltonian is ensured by a
gauge invariant subspace of the experimental system. A scheme to realize local
gauge constraint by single ancillary qubit is proposed.

  Aharonov-Bohm effect</title><description>  We study the noncommutative corrections on the time-dependent Aharonov-Bohm
effect when both the coordinate-coordinate and momentum-momentum
noncommutativities are considered. This study is motivated by the recent
observation that there is no net phase shift in the time-dependent AB effect on
the ordinary space, and therefore tiny derivation from zero can indicate new
physics. The vanishing of the time-dependent AB phase shift on the ordinary
space is preserved by the gauge and Lorentz symmetries. However, on the
noncomutative phase space, while the ordinary gauge symmetry can be kept by the
Seiberg-Witten map, but the Lorentz symmetry is broken. Therefore nontrivial
noncommutative corrections are expected. We find there are three kinds of
noncommutative corrections in general: 1) $\xi$-dependent correction which
comes from the noncommutativity among momentum operators; 2) momentum-dependent
correction which is rooted in the nonlocal interactions in the noncommutative
extended model; 3) momentum-independent correction which emerges become of the
gauge invariant condition on the nonlocal interactions in the noncommutative
model. We proposed two dimensionless quantities, which are based on the
distributions of the measured phase shift with respect to the external magnetic
field and to the cross section enclosed by the particle trajectory, to extract
the noncommutative parameters. We find that stronger (weaker) magnetic field
strength can give better bounds on the coordinate-coordinate
(momentum-momentum) noncommutative parameter, and large parameter space region
can be explored by the time-dependent AB effect.

  Coherent and Squeezed Vacuum</title><description>  The search for gravitational waves is a significant undertaking; taking place
at several locations around the world. Here we discuss the optimal measurement
scheme for interferometric gravitational wave detectors and similar setups and
find that a single mode intensity measurement, while able to beat the
shot-noise limit, is outperformed by other measurement schemes in the low-power
regime, but at high powers, is only outperformed by a small factor.
Specifically, we confirm, that the optimal measurement scheme under ideal
conditions is the parity measurement and also discuss the performance of
several other common measurement schemes when considering photon loss, detector
efficiency, phase drift, and thermal photon noise. We conclude that, with noise
considerations, a homodyne measurement is likely the best-performing
measurement and is superior to a standard single-mode intensity measurement in
the low-power regime. At high powers, most detection schemes are similar,
except parity, which suffers significantly under loss and thermal photon noise.

the first experimental observation of the torsional vibration of an optically

vibration of a nonspherical nanoparticle whose polarizability is a tensor. The
torsional vibration frequency can be one order of magnitude higher than its

With an ellipsoidal model, we propose a simple yet novel scheme to achieve

  Magnetic Aharonov-Bohm Phase Shift</title><description>  A complete quantum analysis of Aharonov-Bohm (A-B) magnetic phase shift
involves three entities, the electron, the charges constituting the solenoid
current, and the vector potential. The usual calculation supposes that the
solenoid's vector potential may be well-approximated as classical. The A-B
shift is then acquired by the quantized electron moving in this vector
potential. Recently, Vaidman presented a semi-classical calculation, later
confirmed by a fully quantum calculation of Pearle and Rizzi, where it is
supposed that the electron's vector potential may be well-approximated as
classical. The A-B shift is then acquired by the quantized solenoid charges
moving in this vector potential. Here we present a third calculation, which
supposes that the electron and solenoid currents may be well-approximated as
classical sources. The A-B phase shift is then shown to be acquired by the
quantized vector potential. We regard these as three equivalent alternative
ways of calculating the A-B shift. To show this, consider the exact problem
where all three entities are quantized. But, as in the first two cases above,
make the supposition that it is a good approximation to take the vector
potential as classical. With both the electron phase shift and the solenoid
phase shift mechanisms operating, this gives twice the A-B phase shift. Thus,
this is a faulty supposition. We make a better approximation. We take the wave
function for the exact problem as the product of a vector potential wave
function and an electron/solenoid wave function, and apply a variational
principle. This leads to a Schr\&quot;odinger equation for the electron/solenoid
wave function with an additional term. The additional term can be written so as
to cancel the electron phase shift mechanism, or to cancel the solenoid phase
shift mechanism. This leads to three alternative views.

consists of 3 terms: the pure electromagnetic term $H_{\rm em}$, the pure
matter term $H_{\rm matt}$ and the interaction term $H_{\rm int}$. The $H_{\rm
em}$-term commutes with all matter fields because it does not have any explicit
dependence on matter fields. As a consequence, $H_{\rm em}$ cannot generate any
forces on matter. Since it is precisely this term that generates the vacuum
energy of EM field, it follows that the vacuum energy does not generate the
forces. The erroneous statements in the literature that vacuum energy generates
Casimir force can be boiled down to the fact that $H_{\rm em}$ attains an
implicit dependence on matter fields by the use of the equations of motion and
the illegitimate treatment of the implicit dependence as if it was explicit.
The true origin of the Casimir force is van der Waals force generated by
$H_{\rm int}$.

the environment is a proper thermal bath. First we discuss the general issue of
dilation for qubit phase damping. Based on the usual thermal bath of harmonic
oscillators, we derive criteria of separability and entanglement between an

Werner states, we find that entanglement between the system and environment is
built up in time for temperatures below a certain critical temperature
$T_{\mathrm{crit}}$. On the other hand, the total state remains separable
during those short times that are relevant for decoherence and loss of
entanglement in the two-qubit state. Close to $T_{\mathrm{crit}}$ the SE
correlations oscillate between separable and entangled. Even though these

entropic formulation of the uncertainty principle. Traditionally, uncertainty
relations correspond to resolution limits; increasing a detector's position
sensitivity decreases its momentum sensitivity and vice-versa. However, this is
not required in general; for example, position information can instead be
extracted at the cost of noise in momentum. Using random, partial projections
in position followed by strong measurements in momentum, we efficiently
determine the transverse-position and transverse-momentum distributions of an

non-locality, mixed states of any two subsystems are correlated in a stronger
way than what can be accounted for by considering correlated probabilities of

explicitly build two-point quantum correlation functions, which capture the
specific, superior correlations of quantum systems at finite temperature, and
which are directly { accessible to experiments when correlating measurable
properties}. When non-vanishing, these correlation functions rule out a precise
form of separability of the equilibrium state. In particular, we show
numerically that quantum correlation functions generically exhibit a finite
\emph{quantum coherence length}, dictating the characteristic distance over
which degrees of freedom cannot be considered as separable. This coherence
length is completely disconnected from the correlation length of the system --
as it remains finite even when the correlation length of the system diverges at
finite temperature -- and it unveils the unique spatial structure of quantum
correlations.

rapid repeated unitary interactions with a sequence of ancillary systems. We
study in detail how decoherence appears as a subleading effect when a quantum
system is 'bombarded' by a quick succession of ancillas. In the most general
case, these ancillas are a) taken from an ensemble of quantum systems of
different dimensions, b) prepared in different states, and c) interacting with
the system through different Hamiltonians. We derive an upper bound on
decoherence rates in this regime, and show how a rich variety of phenomena in
open dynamics (such as projection, thermalization, purification, and dephasing)
can emerge out of our general model of repeated interaction. Furthermore, we
show a fundamental link between the strength of the leading order dissipation
and the intrinsic &quot;unpredictability&quot; in the system-ancilla interaction. We also
discuss how these results encompass and extend results obtained with other
earlier models of repeated interaction.

  Measurements</title><description>  Motivated by the recent efforts to describe the gravitational interaction as
a classical channel arising from continuous quantum measurements, we study what
types of dynamics can emerge from a model of repeated short interactions of a
system with a set of ancillae. We show that contingent on the model parameters
the resulting dynamics ranges from exact unitarity to arbitrary fast
decoherence (quantum Zeno effect). For a series of measurements the effective
dynamics includes feedback-control, which for a composite system yields
effective interactions between the subsystems. We quantify the amount of
decoherence accompanying such induced interactions, generalizing the lower
bound of the gravitational example. However, by allowing multipartite
measurements, the interactions can be induced with arbitrary low decoherence.
Our results have implications for gravity-inspired decoherence models and the
simple framework used in the present study can find applications in devising
novel quantum control protocols, or quantum simulations.

  applications</title><description>  The Kitaev honeycomb model is a paradigm of exactly-solvable models, showing
non-trivial physical properties such as topological quantum order, abelian and
non-abelian anyons, and chirality. Its solution is one of the most beautiful
examples of the interplay of different mathematical techniques in condensed
matter physics. In this paper, we show how to derive a tensor network (TN)
description of the eigenstates of this spin-1/2 model in the thermodynamic
limit, and in particular for its ground state. In our setting, eigenstates are
naturally encoded by an exact 3d TN structure made of fermionic unitary
operators, corresponding to the unitary quantum circuit building up the
many-body quantum state. In our derivation we review how the different
&quot;solution ingredients&quot; of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be accounted for in
the TN language, namely: Jordan-Wigner transformation, braidings of Majorana
modes, fermionic Fourier transformation, and Bogoliubov transformation. The TN
built in this way allows for a clear understanding of several properties of the
model. In particular, we show how the fidelity diagram is straightforward both
at zero temperature and at finite temperature in the vortex-free sector.
Finally, we also discuss the pros and cons of contracting of our 3d TN down to
a 2d Projected Entangled Pair State (PEPS) with finite bond dimension. The
results in this paper can be extended to generalizations of the Kitaev model,
e.g., to other lattices, spins, and dimensions.

Glauber-Sudarshan P-function $P(\alpha)$ is especially useful for calculating
the density matrix of a system, but it is often assumed that $P(\alpha)$ may
not exist for highly quantum-mechanical systems due to its singular nature.
Here we define a generalized delta function with a complex argument and derive
its properties, which are very different from those of a conventional Dirac
delta function. The generalized delta function is then used to calculate
$P(\alpha)$ for a Schrodinger cat state in a surprisingly simple form. The
generalized delta function effectively converts the diagonal elements that

Similar techniques can be used for more general quantum states.

canonic Hamiltonian $\widetilde{h}_c$ follows from dropping all the interaction
terms between free bosons with momentum $\hbar\mathbf{k}\ne\mathbf{0}$.
Bogoliubov Canonic Approximation (BCA) is a further manipulation, replacing the
number \emph{operator} $\widetilde{N}_{in}$ of free particles in
$\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, with the total number $N$ of bosons. BCA transforms
$\widetilde{h}_c$ into a different Hamiltonian
$H_{BCA}=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\ne\mathbf{0}}\epsilon(k)B^\dagger_\mathbf{k}B_\mathbf{k}+const$,
where $B^\dagger_\mathbf{k}$ and $B_\mathbf{k}$ create/annihilate non
interacting pseudoparticles. The problem of the \emph{exact} eigenstates of the
truncated Hamiltonian is completely solved in the thermodynamic limit (TL) for
a special class of eigensolutions $|\:S,\:\mathbf{k}\:\rangle_{c}$, denoted as
\textquoteleft s-pseudobosons\textquoteright, with energies
$\mathcal{E}_{S}(k)$ and \emph{zero} total momentum. Some preliminary results
are given for the exact eigenstates (denoted as \textquoteleft
$\eta$-pseudobosons\textquoteright), carrying a total momentum
$\eta\hbar\mathbf{k}$ ($\eta=\:1,\:2,\: \dots$). A comparison is done with
$H_{BCA}$ and with the Gross-Pitaevskii theory (GPT), showing that some
differences between exact and BCA/GPT results persist even in the TL. Finally,
it is argued that the emission of $\eta$-pseudobosons, which is responsible for
the dissipation $\acute{a}$ \emph{la} Landau \cite{L}, could be significantly
different from the usual picture, based on BCA pseudobosons.

resolution for this discord by first observing that there is a problem of time
in quantum theory. There should exist a reformulation of quantum theory which
does not refer to classical time. Such a reformulation is obtained by
suggesting that space-time is fundamentally non-commutative. Quantum theory
without classical time is the equilibrium statistical thermodynamics of the

However, measurement on an entangled state can be correctly described only in
the underlying non-commutative space-time, where there is no causality

this phase-space distribution cannot be directly reconstructed for arbitrary

computing the real-time dynamics in gauge theories is a notorious challenge for
classical computational methods. In the spirit of Feynman's vision of a quantum
simulator, this has recently stimulated theoretical effort to devise schemes
for simulating such theories on engineered quantum-mechanical devices, with the
difficulty that gauge invariance and the associated local conservation laws
(Gauss laws) need to be implemented. Here we report the first experimental
demonstration of a digital quantum simulation of a lattice gauge theory, by
realising 1+1-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (Schwinger model) on a
few-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer. We are interested in the real-time
evolution of the Schwinger mechanism, describing the instability of the bare
vacuum due to quantum fluctuations, which manifests itself in the spontaneous
creation of electron-positron pairs. To make efficient use of our quantum
resources, we map the original problem to a spin model by eliminating the gauge
fields in favour of exotic long-range interactions, which have a direct and
efficient implementation on an ion trap architecture. We explore the Schwinger
mechanism of particle-antiparticle generation by monitoring the mass production
and the vacuum persistence amplitude. Moreover, we track the real-time
evolution of entanglement in the system, which illustrates how particle
creation and entanglement generation are directly related. Our work represents
a first step towards quantum simulating high-energy theories with atomic

receives a (classical or quantum) state from some known ensemble and needs to
transmit it to the receiver Bob with average error below some specified bound.
We consider the case in which the message can have a variable length and goal
is to minimize its expected length.
  For classical case this problem has a well-known solution given by the
Huffman coding. In this scheme, expected length of the message is equal to the
Shannon entropy of the source (with a constant additive factor) and the
protocol succeeds with zero error. This is a single-shot scheme from which the
asymptotic result, viz. Shannon's source coding theorem, can be recovered by
encoding each input state sequentially.
  For the quantum case, the asymptotic compression rate is given by the
von-Neumann entropy. However, we show that there is no one-shot scheme which is
able to match this rate, even if interactive communication is allowed. This is
a relatively rare case in quantum information theory where the cost of a
quantum task is significantly different from its classical analogue. Our result

follows: particular spatial points follow an exceptional dynamical path that
differs from that of their neighbors, with the consequence that in the
neighborhood of these exceptional points the spatial profile becomes ever more
sharp. Spikes are consequences of the BKL-type oscillatory evolution towards
generic singularities of spacetime. Do spikes persist when the spacetime
dynamics are treated using quantum mechanics? To address this question, we

Therefore high quality entangled photon sources based on fibers are on

multiplexed polarization and timebin entanglement photon sources based on
dispersion shifted fiber operating at room temperature. High qualities of
entanglement are characterized by using interference, Bell inequality and
quantum state tomography. Simultaneous presence of entanglements in

  emission in a quantum dot coupled to normal and superconducting continua</title><description>  Microwave cavities have been widely used to investigate the behavior of
closed few-level systems. Here, we show that they also represent a powerful
probe for the dynamics of charge transfer between a discrete electronic level
and fermionic continua. We have combined experiment and theory for a carbon
nanotube quantum dot coupled to normal metal and superconducting contacts. In
equilibrium conditions, where our device behaves as an effective quantum
dot-normal metal junction, we approach a universal photon dissipation regime
governed by a quantum charge relaxation effect. We observe how photon
dissipation is modified when the dot admittance turns from capacitive to
inductive. When the fermionic reservoirs are voltage biased, the dot can even
cause photon emission due to inelastic tunneling to/from a
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer peak in the density of states of the superconducting
contact. We can model these numerous effects quantitatively in terms of the
charge susceptibility of the quantum dot circuit. This validates an approach
that could be used to study a wide class of mesoscopic QED devices.

generally smeared due to their interaction with the surroundings. In this
article we study the spreading of QC, as quantified by the $l_{1}$-norm QC,
when a qubit is subjected to noise channels commonly appearing in quantum
information science. We report several interesting aspects of this
environment-induced QC flow. For instance, we notice that QC is generally not
conserved and that even incoherent initial states can lead to transitory
system-environment and/or environment QC. We show that for the amplitude
damping channel the evolved total QC can be written as the sum of local and
non-local parts, with the last one being equal to entanglement. On the other
hand, for the phase damping channel entanglement does not account for all
non-local QC, with the gap between them depending on time and also on the qubit
initial state. Besides these issues, the possibility and conditions for time
invariance of QC are regarded in the case of bit, phase, and bit-phase flip
channels. The depolarizing channel is also considered, with the qubit's ability
to act as a catalyst for the creation of joint QC and entanglement being
noticed.

overwhelmingly large for high- dimensional systems. This obstacle may be
overcome by abandoning traditional cornerstones of quantum measurement, such as
general quantum states, strong projective measurement, and assumption-free
characterization. Following this reasoning, we demonstrate an efficient
technique for characterizing high-dimensional, spatial entanglement with one

filtering of the same ensemble in momentum followed by position---something the
uncertainty principle forbids for projective measurements. Exploiting the
expectation that entangled signals are highly correlated, we use fewer than
5,000 measurements to characterize a 65, 536-dimensional state. Finally, we use
entropic inequalities to witness entanglement without a density matrix. Our
method represents the sea change unfolding in quantum measurement where methods
influenced by the information theory and signal-processing communities replace
unscalable, brute-force techniques---a progression previously followed by
classical sensing.

this for a multimode interferometer with a phase in each mode, using Gaussian
inputs and passive elements, by calculating the covariance matrix. The quantum
Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound provides a lower bound to the covariance matrix via the
quantum Fisher information matrix, whose elements we derive to be the

In spite of the Gaussian nature of the problem, these elements require the

Boolean variables, that in his opinion represents a demarcation line between
possible and impossible experience. This inequality forms an important
milestone in the epistemology of probability theory and probability measures.
  In 1985 Leggett and Garg derived a physics related inequality, mathematically
identical to Boole's, that according to them represents a demarcation between
macroscopic realism and quantum mechanics. Their formalism, constructed for the
magnetic flux of SQUIDS, includes general features and applies also to many
other quantum experiments.
  We show that a wide gulf, a wide divide, separates the &quot;sense impressions&quot;
and corresponding data, as well as the postulates of macroscopic realism, from
the mathematical abstractions that are used to derive the inequality of
Leggett-Garg. If the gulf can be bridged, one may indeed derive the said
inequality, which is then clearly a demarcation between possible and impossible
experience: it cannot be violated and is not violated by quantum theory. We
deduce from this fact that a violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality does not
mean that the SQUID-flux is not there when nobody looks, as Leggett-Garg
suggest, but instead that the probability measures may not be what Leggett-Garg
have assumed them to be, when no data can be secured that directly relate to
them. We show that similar considerations apply to other well known quantum
interpretation-puzzles including that of the two-slit experiment.

two-dimensional topological photonic system of coupled ring resonators. This
system implements the integer quantum Hall model using a synthetic gauge field
and exhibits topologically robust edge states. We show that the topological
edge states provide a robust channel for on-chip quantum communication when the
information is encoded in temporal correlations of photons. In contrast to edge
states, transport through bulk states does not preserve these correlations and
can lead to significant unwanted temporal bunching or anti-bunching of photons.
We also compare the transport of entangled two-photon states to separable
two-photon states and show that the entangled states are more fragile.
Furthermore, we study the effect of disorder on the quantum transport
properties; while the edge transport remains robust, bulk transport is very
susceptible, and in the limit of strong disorder, bulk states become localized.
We show that this localization is manifested as an enhanced
bunching/anti-bunching of photons.

superconducting circuits, the Unruh effect, and Hawking radiation. Here we
study the communication capabilities of quantum amplifier channels. Provided
that a particular minimum output entropy conjecture is true, we determine
capacities of quantum amplifier channels in three different scenarios. First,
we establish the capacities of the quantum-limited amplifier channel for one of
the most general communication tasks, characterized by the trade-off between
classical communication, quantum communication, and entanglement generation or

channel for the trade-off between public classical communication, private
classical communication, and secret key generation. In these settings, we find
that capacities decrease with increasing amplifier gain, due to unavoidable
quantum-mechanical amplification noise. Third, we determine the capacity region
for a single-sender, two-receiver broadcast channel induced by a unitary
dilation of the quantum amplifier channel, and we also show that a fully

strategies. Finally, we provide compelling evidence that the needed minimum

quantum field theory, in the background of the Schwarzschild metric. Three
pieces of insight are obtained: One, we learn how the gravitational back
reaction, whose dominant component can be calculated exactly, turns particles
entering the hole, into particles leaving it, by exchanging the momentum- and
position operators; two, we find out how this effect removes firewalls, both on
the future and the past event horizon, and three, we discover that the presence
of region II in the Penrose diagram forces a topological twist in the
background metric, culminating in antipodal identification. Although a cut-off
is required that effectively replaces the transverse coordinates by a lattice,
the effect of such a cut-off minimizes when the spherical wave expansion is

security and information capacity over quantum channels. Unfortunately,
entanglement decays due to perturbations, corrupting quantum links which cannot
be repaired without a tomography of the channel. Paradoxically, the channel
tomography itself is not possible without a working link. Here we overcome this
problem with a robust approach to characterising quantum channels by means of
classical light. Using free-space communication in a turbulent atmosphere as an
example, we show that the state evolution of classically entangled degrees of
freedom is equivalent to that of quantum entangled pho- tons, thus providing
new physical insights into the notion of classical entanglement. The analysis
of quantum channels by means of classical light in real time unravels
stochastic dynamics in terms of pure state trajectories and thus enables
precise quantum error-correction in short and long haul optical communication,
in both free-space and fibre.

faithful transmission of information, but prohibits an interaction between the
photons as required for a plethora of applications in optical quantum
information processing. The long-standing challenge here is to realise a
deterministic photon-photon gate. This requires an interaction so strong that
the two photons can shift each others phase by pi. For polarisation qubits,
this amounts to the conditional flipping of one photon's polarisation to an
orthogonal state. So far, only probabilistic gates based on linear optics and
photon detectors could be realised, as &quot;no known or foreseen material has an
optical nonlinearity strong enough to implement this conditional phase
shift...&quot; [Science 318, 1567]. Meanwhile, tremendous progress in the
development of quantum-nonlinear systems has opened up new possibilities for
single-photon experiments. Platforms range from Rydberg blockade in atomic
ensembles to single-atom cavity quantum electrodynamics. Applications like
single-photon switches and transistors, two-photon gateways, nondestructive
photon detectors, photon routers and nonlinear phase shifters have been
demonstrated, but none of them with the ultimate information carriers, optical
qubits. Here we employ the strong light-matter coupling provided by a single
atom in a high-finesse optical resonator to realise the Duan-Kimble protocol of
a universal controlled phase flip (CPF, pi phase shift) photon-photon quantum
gate. We achieve an average gate fidelity of F=(76.2+/-3.6)% and specifically
demonstrate the capability of conditional polarisation flipping as well as
entanglement generation between independent input photons. Our gate could
readily perform most of the hitherto existing two-photon operations. It also
discloses avenues towards new quantum information processing applications where

  Microcanonical Analysis</title><description>  The thermodynamical properties of a generalized Dicke model are calculated
and related with the critical properties of its energy spectrum, namely the
quantum phase transitions (QPT) and excited state quantum phase transitions
(ESQPT). The thermal properties are calculated both in the canonical and the
microcanonical ensembles. The latter deduction allows for an explicit
description of the relation between thermal and energy spectrum properties.
While in an isolated system the subspaces with different pseudo spin are
disconnected, and the whole energy spectrum is accesible, in the thermal
ensamble the situation is radically different. The multiplicity of the lowest
energy states for each pseudo spin completely dominates the thermal behavior,
making the set of degenerate states with the smallest pseudo spin at a given
energy the only ones playing a role in the thermal properties, making the
positive energy states thermally inaccesible. Their quantum phase transitions,
from a normal to a superradiant phase, are closely associated with the thermal
transition. The other critical phenomena, the ESQPTs occurring at excited
energies, have no manifestation in the thermodynamics, although their effects
could be seen in finite sizes corrections. A new superradiant phase is found,
which only exists in the generalized model, and can be relevant in finite size
systems.

studied by E. Crosson, E. Farhi, C. Yen-Yu Lin, H.-H. Lin, and P. Shor (CFLLS)
[arXiv:1401.7320]. When tested on the full set, the parameters that we find
produce significantly larger overlap than the optimized annealing times of
CFLLS. Testing on other random instances from $20$ to $28$ bits continues to
show improvement over annealing, with the improvement being most notable on the
hardest instances. Further tests on instances of MAX-3-SAT also showed
improvement on the hardest instances. This algorithm may be a possible

pairs through the process of spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) in a few-mode,
birefringent fiber. Under these conditions, multiple SFWM processes are in fact
possible, each associated with a different combination of transverse modes for
the four waves involved. We show that in the weakly guiding regime, for which
the propagation modes may be well approximated by linearly polarized modes, the
departure from circular symmetry due to the fiber birefringence translates into
conservation rules which retain elements from azimuthal and rectangular
symmetries: both OAM and parity must be conserved for a process to be viable.
We have implemented a SFWM source based on a &quot;bow-tie&quot; birefringent fiber, and
have measured for a collection of pump wavelengths the SFWM spectra of each of
the signal and idler photons in coincidence with its partner photon. We have
used this information, together with knowledge of the transverse modes into
which the signal and idler photons are emitted, as input for a genetic
algorithm which accomplishes two tasks: i) the identification of the particular
SFWM processes which are present in the source, and ii) the characterization of
the fiber used.

the Hilbert space of $N$ identical fermions. There appears a finite number
$N!^{d-1}$ of many-body wave functions, called shapes, which cannot be
generated by trivial combinatorial extension of the one-dimensional ones. A
general algorithm is given to list them all in terms of standard Slater
determinants. Conversely, excitations which can be induced from the
one-dimensional case are bosonised into a system of distinguishable bosons,
called Euler bosons, much like the electromagnetic field is quantized in terms
of photons distinguishable by their wave numbers. Their wave functions are
given explicitly in terms of elementary symmetric functions, reflecting the
fact that the fermion sign problem is trivial in one dimension. The shapes act
as vacua for the Euler bosons. They are the natural generalization of the
single-Slater-determinant form for the ground state to more than one dimension.
In terms of algebraic invariant theory, the shapes are antisymmetric invariants
which finitely generate the $N$-fermion Hilbert space as a graded algebra over
the ring of symmetric polynomials. Analogous results hold for identical bosons.

form important information: there are cases where non-Hermitian boundary
contributions emerge. These contributions actually appear naturally, in order
for the above theorems to be valid and applicable (i.e. in multiply-connected
spaces), and this occurs for physical quantities that are not represented by
well-defined self-adjoint operators (such as the position operator in a
periodic potential, or in general Aharonov-Bohm configurations, either in real

procedures). In this short note, we report modifications of these two theorems
when such non-Hermiticities appear, and we demonstrate how they restore certain
Quantum Mechanical paradoxes (most of them having been noticed in the past as
violations of the so-called Hypervirial theorem in Quantum Chemistry). This
restoration of paradoxes (essentially the re-establishment of applicability of
the Ehrenfest theorem even in multiply-connected spaces) always proceeds
through the appearance of certain generalized currents, in a theoretical
picture with interesting structure (where a generalized violated continuity
equation shows up naturally).

spontaneous four wave mixing (SFWM) process in a few-mode fiber, in a geometry
which permits multiple, simultaneous SFWM processes, each associated with a
distinct combination of transverse modes for the four participating waves. In
our source: i) each process is group-velocity-matched so that it is, by design,
nearly-factorable, and ii) the spectral separation between neighboring

Consequently, there is a direct correspondence between the joint amplitude of
each process and each of the Schmidt mode pairs of the overall two-photon
state. Our approach permits hybrid entanglement in discrete frequency and in
transverse mode, whereby control of the number of supported fiber transverse
modes allows scalability to higher dimensions while spectral filtering may be
used for straightforward Schmidt mode discrimination.

satellite over two independent atmospheric-fading channels dominated by
turbulence-induced beam wander. In this MDI protocol the measurement device is
the satellite itself, and the security of the protocol is analyzed through an
equivalent entanglement-based swapping scheme. We quantify the positive impact
the fading channels can have on the final quantum key rates, demonstrating how
the protocol is able to generate a positive key rate even over high-loss
atmospheric channels. This is somewhat counter-intuitive given that the same
outcome is only possible in the low-loss regime for a measurement device
centrally positioned in a fiber-optic channel. Our results show that useful

stabilizer states are of particularly importance in the application of
fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). However, how to efficiently prepare
arbitrary CSS stabilizer states for general CSS stabilizer codes is still

With the ability to produce high-quality ancillary states, FTQC schemes using
Steane syndrome extraction or those based on teleportation become promising.
These ancillary states are expensive and valuable. Along the same lines, we
show that classical coding techniques can reduce ancilla consumption by using
additional transversal controlled-NOT gates and classical computing power. In

Such quantum backaction is typically difficult to observe at room temperature
where the motion driven by optical quantum intensity fluctuations is many

cross-correlation technique to distinguish optically driven motion from
thermally driven motion, observing this quantum backaction signature up to room

strongly-disordered systems in the many-body localized phase have universal

many-body localized systems from ergodic systems, as well as from ground states

By removing all but two particles from an $N$-qubit W state, the resulting

couples the covariance operators of classical (prequantum) random fields with
the quantum density operators. We use this correspondence to clarify the
physical meaning of the pure quantum state and the superposition principle - by
using the formalism of classical field correlations.

strategy to protect such systems from decoherence is dynamical decoupling.
However many promising quantum devices, such as oscillators, are infinite
dimensional, for which the question if dynamical decoupling could be applied
remained open. Here we first show that not every infinite-dimensional system
can be protected from decoherence through dynamical decoupling. Then we develop
dynamical decoupling for continuous variable systems which are described by
quadratic Hamiltonians. We identify a condition and a set of operations that
allow us to map a set of interacting harmonic oscillators onto a set of
non-interacting oscillators rotating with an averaged frequency, a procedure we
call homogenization. Furthermore we show that every quadratic
system-environment interaction can be suppressed with two simple operations
acting only on the system. Using a random dynamical decoupling or
homogenization scheme, we develop bounds that characterize how fast we have to
work in order to achieve the desired uncoupled dynamics. This allows us to
identify how well homogenization can be achieved and decoherence can be
suppressed in continuous variable systems.

Planckian black hole is, by all means, just another &quot;particle&quot;, even if with a

dynamics is equivalently described in terms of a particle moving in
gravitational potential derived from the horizon equation itself in a

For small number of pulses, $\pi_z$ control yields anti-Zeno behavior, whereas
$\pi_y$ pulses minimize the error for a finite $n$. For the current noise
figures in superconducting qubits, two-qubit gate errors $\sim 10^{-6}$,
meeting the requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation, can be
achieved. The Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence is the most efficient
procedure, stable for $1/f$ noise with UV-cutoff up to gigahertz.

$\varrho$ based on the canonical Schr\&quot;odinger pairs of position and momentum
observables in copies of $L^2(\mathbb{R}^k)$, indexed by an additive abelian
group $D$ of countable cardinality. Such observables admit an autocovariance
map $\widetilde{K}$ from $D$ into the space of real $2k \times 2k$ matrices.
The map $\widetilde{K}$ on the discrete group $D$ admits a spectral
representation as the Fourier transform of a $2k \times 2k$ complex Hermitain
matrix-valued totally finite measure $\Phi$ on the compact character group
$\widehat{D}$, called the Kolmogorov-Wiener-Masani (KWM) spectrum of the
process $\varrho$. Necessary and sufficient conditions on a $2k \times 2k$
complex Hermitian matrix-valued measure $\Phi$ on $\widehat{D}$ to be the KWM
spectrum of a process $\varrho$ are obtained. This enables the construction of

relations among the position and momentum observables on the KWM spectrum of
the process $\varrho$. In particular, KWM spectrum cannot admit a gap of
positive Haar measure in $\widehat{D}$.
  The relationship between the number of photons in a particular mode at any

  geometry</title><description>  The reduced density matrices (RDMs) of many-body quantum states form a convex
set. The boundary of low dimensional projections of this convex set may exhibit
nontrivial geometry such as ruled surfaces. In this paper, we study the
physical origins of these ruled surfaces for bosonic systems. The emergence of
ruled surfaces was recently proposed as signatures of symmetry-breaking phase.
We show that, apart from being signatures of symmetry-breaking, ruled surfaces
can also be the consequence of gapless quantum systems by demonstrating an
explicit example in terms of a two-mode Ising model. Our analysis was largely
simplified by the quantum de Finetti's theorem---in the limit of large system
size, these RDMs are the convex set of all the symmetric separable states. To
distinguish ruled surfaces originated from gapless systems from those caused by
symmetry-breaking, we propose to use the finite size scaling method for the
corresponding geometry. This method is then applied to the two-mode XY model,
successfully identifying a ruled surface as the consequence of gapless systems.

I show that all non-null quantum discord states which are neither

nonclassical correlations which have non-null Bell and/or Mermin discord for

an external field whose parameters are slowly and cyclically changed. A
variation in the coupling between the system and the external field can also

the artificial atom acquires a geometric phase determined by the path traced

In particular, adding bang-bang control of amplitude damping noise (non-unital)

contentious issue on the quantum logic side is the modularity law, proposed by
von Neumann to mitigate the failure of distributivity of quantum logical
connectives. We show that, if quantum logic and categorical quantum mechanics
are formalized in the same framework, then the antispecial law of categorical
quantum mechanics corresponds to the natural requirement of effect algebras
that the units are each other's unique complements, and that the modularity law
corresponds to the Frobenius condition. These correspondences lead to the
equivalence announced in the title. Aligning the two formalisms, at the very
least, sheds new light on the concepts that are more clearly displayed on one
side than on the other (such as e.g. the orthogonality). Beyond that, it may
also open up new approaches to deep and important problems of quantum mechanics
(such as the classification of complementary observables).

  Dimension</title><description>  Traditionally, covariant scalar field theory models are either super
renormalizable, strictly renormalizable, or nonrenormalizable. The goal of
`Mixed Models' is to make sense of sums of these distinct examples, e.g.,
$g\varphi^4_3+g'\varphi^6_3+g''\varphi^8_3$, which includes an example of each
kind for spacetime dimension $n=3$. We show how the several interactions such
mixed models have may be turned on and off in any order without any
difficulties. Analogous results are shown for $g\varphi^4_n+g'\varphi^{138}_n$,
etc., for all $n\ge3$. Different categories hold for $n=2$ such as, e.g., ${g
P(\varphi)_2+g' N\!P}(\varphi)_2$, that involve polynomial ($P$) and suitable
nonpolynomial ($N\!P$) interactions, etc. Analogous situations for $n=1$ (time
alone) offer simple `toy' examples of how such mixed models may be constructed.

properties through the variation of its response with frequencies or time
delays. Quantum light opens up new avenues for spectroscopy by utilizing
parameters of the quantum state of light as novel control knobs and through the
variation of photon statistics by coupling to matter. We present an intuitive
diagrammatic approach for calculating ultrafast spectroscopy signals induced by
quantum light, focusing on applications involving entangled photons with
nonclassical bandwidth properties - known as &quot;time-energy entanglement&quot;.
Nonlinear optical signals induced by quantized light fields are expressed using
time ordered multipoint correlation functions of superoperators. These are
different from Glauber's g- functions for photon counting which use normally
ordered products of ordinary operators. Entangled photon pairs are not
subjected to the classical Fourier limitations on the joint temporal and
spectral resolution. After a brief survey of properties of entangled photon
pairs relevant to their spectroscopic applications, different optical signals,

small scale quantum processors containing multiple interacting qubits within
them. Simple quantum circuits have been demonstrated and scaling up to larger
numbers is underway. However as the number of qubits in these processors
increases, it becomes challenging to implement switchable or tunable coherent
coupling among them. The typical approach has been to detune each qubit from
others or the quantum bus it connected to, but as the number of qubits
increases this becomes problematic to achieve in practice due to frequency
crowding issues. Here, we demonstrate that by applying a fast longitudinal
control field to the target qubit, we can turn off its couplings to other
qubits or buses (in principle on/off ratio higher than 100 dB). This has
important implementations in superconducting circuits as it means we can keep
the qubits at their optimal points, where the coherence properties are
greatest, during coupling/decoupling processing. Our approach suggests a new
way to control coupling among qubits and data buses that can be naturally
scaled up to large quantum processors without the need for auxiliary circuits
and yet be free of the frequency crowding problems.

such a reconstruction subspace---only ad hoc methods that rely on
hard-to-certify assumptions about the source and strategies. We provide a
straightforward and numerically feasible procedure to uniquely determine the
appropriate reconstruction subspace for any given unknown quantum state of

statistical principle of maximum likelihood, along with other validation tools,
to grow an appropriate seed subspace into the optimal reconstruction subspace,
much like the nucleation of a seed into a crystal. Apart from using the
available measurement data, no other spurious assumptions about the source or
ad hoc strategies are invoked. As a result, there will no longer be
reconstruction artifacts present in state reconstruction, which is a usual
consequence of a bad choice of reconstruction subspace. The procedure can be
understood as the maximum-likelihood reconstruction for quantum subspaces,
which is an analog to, and fully compatible with that for quantum states.

the structure of multiorbital correlations is far richer; and, in the case of

detection of a two-mode light field is restricted to interferometric setups and
local intensity measurements. Even the full reconstruction of the quantum state
of a single radiation mode relies on such detection layouts and the preparation

of the essential quantum correlations of two-mode light fields. It refers to
those quantum correlations which are measurable by a given device, i.e., the
accessible part of a nonclassical Glauber-Sudarshan phase-space distribution,
which does not depend on a global phase. Assuming a simple four-port
interferometer and photon-number-resolving detectors, we derive the

dissipation on quantum many-body systems in their many-body localized (MBL)
phase. While in the presence of dephasing noise such systems reach a unique
ergodic state, their dynamics is characterized by slow relaxation manifested in
non-exponential decay of self-correlations. Here we shed light on a currently
much debated issue, namely the role of interactions for this relaxation
dynamics. We focus on the experimentally relevant situation of the evolution
from an initial charge density wave in the presence of strong dephasing noise.
We find a crossover from a regime dominated by disorder to a regime dominated
by interactions, with a concomitant change of time correlators from stretched
exponential to compressed exponential form. The strongly interacting regime can
be explained in terms of nucleation and growth dynamics of relaxing regions -
reminiscent of the kinetics of crystallization in soft matter systems - and
should be observable experimentally. This interaction-driven crossover suggests
that the competition between interactions and noise give rise to a much richer
structure of the MBL phase than anticipated so far.

theory is required to capture dynamic electron correlation from the otherwise
neglected virtual orbitals. Still, the overall accuracy suffers from the finite
size and choice of the active orbital space and peculiarities of the
perturbation theory. Fortunately, the electronic wave functions at equilibrium
structures of reactants and products can often be well described by
single-reference methods and hence are accessible to accurate coupled cluster
calculations. Here, we calculate the heterolytic double dissociation energy of
four 3d-metallocenes with the complete active space self-consistent field
method and compare to highly accurate coupled cluster data. Our coupled cluster
data are well within the experimental error bars. This accuracy can also be
approached by complete active space calculations with an orbital selection
based on information entropy measures. The entropy based active space selection

Born-Oppenheimer (BO) approximation is investigated. While nonadiabatic
couplings generally lead to entanglement and to a failure of the BO
approximation, surprisingly the degree of electron-nuclear entanglement is
found to be uncorrelated with the degree of validity of the BO approximation.
This is because while the degree of entanglement of BO states is determined by
their deviation from the corresponding states in the crude BO approximation,
the accuracy of the BO approximation is dictated, instead, by the deviation of
the BO states from the exact electron-nuclear states. In fact, in the context
of a minimal avoided crossing model, extreme cases are identified where an
adequate BO state is seen to be maximally entangled, and where the BO
approximation fails but the associated BO state remains approximately
unentangled. Further, the BO states are found to not preserve the entanglement
properties of the exact electron-nuclear eigenstates, and to be completely
unentangled only in the limit in which the BO approximation becomes exact.

i.e. in the unitary limit. We carry out our calculations using lattice methods
devised recently by us. Our results show the effect of strong pairing
correlations on the entanglement entropy, which modify the sub-leading behavior
for large subsystem sizes (as characterized by the dimensionless parameter x=kF
L_A, where kF is the Fermi momentum and L_A the linear subsystem size), but
leave the leading order unchanged relative to the non-interacting case.
Moreover, we find that the onset of the sub-leading asymptotic regime is at
surprisingly small x=2-4. We provide further insight into the entanglement
properties of this system by analyzing the spectrum of the entanglement
Hamiltonian of the two-body problem from weak to strong coupling. The low-lying
entanglement spectrum displays clear features as the strength of the coupling
is varied, such as eigenvalue crossing, a sharp change in the Schmidt gap, and
scale invariance at unitarity. Beyond the low-lying component, the spectrum
appears as a quasi-continuum distribution, for which we present a statistical
characterization; we find, in particular, that the mean shifts to infinity as
the coupling is turned off, which indicates that that part of the spectrum
represents non-perturbative contributions to the entanglement Hamiltonian. In
contrast, the low-lying entanglement spectrum evolves to finite values in the
noninteracting limit. The scale invariance of the unitary regime guarantees
that our results are universal features intrinsic to 3D quantum mechanics and
represent a well-defined prediction for ultracold atom experiments, which were
recently shown to have direct access to the entanglement entropy.

significant portion of the hardware to computational factories that churn out
high-fidelity ancillas called magic states. Often perceived as the most costly
aspect of quantum computation, this means efficient and realistic factory
design is of paramount importance. Here we present the most detailed resource
assessment to date of magic state factories within a surface code quantum
computer, along the way introducing a number of new techniques. We show that
the block codes of Bravyi and Haah [Phys. Rev. A 86, 052329 (2012)] have been
systematically undervalued; we track correlated errors within their output
(both numerically and analytically) and thus estimate their fidelity without
appealing to the union bound. We also introduce a realisation of these
protocols with constant time and low ancilla cost. We thus see that the
overhead of the factory can be reduced by up to a factor of $\sim3$.
Additionally we confirm that scaling of the magic state factory with problem
size is dominated by the overhead of the surface code itself. We find that the
magic state factory required for post-classical factoring can be as small as 6
million data qubits.

macroscopic systems of general spin-j particles using the variance and second
moments of the collective spin components. The class of states detected goes
beyond traditional spin-squeezed states by including Dicke states and other
unpolarized states. The criteria derived are easy to evaluate numerically even
for systems composed of a very large number of particles and outperform past
approaches, especially in practical situations where noise is present. We also
derive analytic lower bounds based on the linearization of our criteria, which
make it possible to define spin-squeezing parameters for Dicke states. As a
by-product, we obtain also an analytic lower bound to the condition derived in

the results to systems with fluctuating number of particles.

fundamental and technological significance. Optical parametric amplifiers allow
for amplifying single photons to the macroscopic level, but the underlying
temporal dynamics are still not well understood. Slow light, in which the group
velocity is delayed via quantum interference, is an effective tool to
interrogate the temporal dynamics of light-matter interactions. Here, we
demonstrate a scheme to characterize micro-macro transitions with slow light
based on a four-wave mixing linear amplification process in a hot rubidium
vapour. The scheme exhibits strong dispersion which is sensitive to the input's
change at the single-photon level, resulting in a nonlinear decay of the
micro-macro transition time with the increased microscopic input. The present
system is suitable for the study of the relevant time scale of
quantum-to-classical transitions and the potential impact from fundamental
effects such as gravity, as indicated by recent proposals.

dissipative quantum dynamics, taking into account the dephasing effects. Fast
and robust population transfer can be obtained by the designed pulses and
detuning, even though the initial state of the system is imperfect. With a
concrete three-level system as a example, the influences of the imperfect
initial state, variations in the control parameters, and various dissipation
effects are discussed in detail. The numerical simulation shows that the scheme
is insensitive to moderate fluctuations of experimental parameters and the
relatively large dissipation effects of the excited state. Furthermore, the
dominant dissipative factors, the dephasing effects of the ground states and
the imperfect initial state are no longer undesirable, in fact, they are the
important resources to the scheme. Therefore, the scheme could provide more
choices for the realization of the complete population transfer in the strong
dissipative fields where the standard stimulated Raman adiabatic passage
(STIRAP) or shortcut schemes are invalid.

whether a direct stochastic sampling and binning of the absolute square of the
complex field amplitude can yield a distribution function $\tilde{P}_n$ that
closely approximates the true particle number probability distribution $P_n$ of

there is indeed a close quantitative correspondence between $\tilde{P}_n$ and
$P_n$ for a wide range of quantum states that have smooth and broad Wigner

practical life is designed and analyzed. Specifically, we have proposed a
hierarchical counterpart of the joint remote state preparation (JRSP) protocol,
where two senders can jointly and remotely prepare a quantum state. One sender
has the information regarding amplitude, while the other one has the phase
information of a quantum state to be jointly prepared at the receiver's port.
However, there exists a hierarchy among the receivers, as far as powers to
reconstruct the quantum state is concerned. A 5-qubit cluster state has been
used here to perform the task. Further, it is established that the proposed
scheme for hierarchical JRSP (HJRSP) is of enormous practical importance in
critical situations involving defense and other sectors, where it is essential
to ensure that an important decision/order that can severely affect a society
or an organization is not taken by a single person, and once the order is
issued all the receivers don't possess an equal right to implement it. Further,
the effect of different noise models (e.g., amplitude damping (AD), phase
damping (PD), collective noise and Pauli noise models) on the HJRSP protocol
proposed here is investigated. It is found that in AD and PD noise models a
higher power agent can reconstruct the quantum state to be remotely prepared
with higher fidelity than that done by the lower power agent(s). In contrast,
the opposite may happen in the presence of collective noise models. We have
also proposed a scheme for probabilistic HJRSP using a non-maximally entangled
5-qubit cluster state.

mistrustful parties is unfortunately impossible to achieve through the
asynchronous exchange of classical and quantum messages. Perfect security can
nonetheless be achieved if each party splits into two agents exchanging
classical information at times and locations satisfying strict relativistic
constraints. A relativistic multi-round protocol to achieve this was previously
proposed and used to implement a 2~millisecond commitment time. Much longer
durations were initially thought to be insecure, but recent theoretical
progress showed that this is not so. In this letter, we report on the
implementation of a 24-hour bit commitment based on timed high-speed optical
communication and fast data processing only, with all agents located within the

before, and we argue that it could be extended to one year and allow much more
flexibility on the locations of the agents. Our implementation offers a

consumption habits of customers by discovering the relationships between
itemsets (sets of items). In this paper, we address ARM in the quantum settings
and propose a quantum algorithm for the key part of ARM, finding out frequent
itemsets from the candidate itemsets and acquiring their supports.
Specifically, for the case in which there are $M_f^{(k)}$ frequent $k$-itemsets
in the $M_c^{(k)}$ candidate $k$-itemsets ($M_f^{(k)} \leq M_c^{(k)}$), our
algorithm can efficiently mine these frequent $k$-itemsets and estimate their
supports by using parallel amplitude estimation and amplitude amplification
with complexity $\mathcal{O}(\frac{k\sqrt{M_c^{(k)}M_f^{(k)}}}{\epsilon})$,
where $\epsilon$ is the error for estimating the supports. Compared with the
classical counterpart, classical sampling-based algorithm, whose complexity is
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{kM_c^{(k)}}{\epsilon^2})$, our quantum algorithm
quadratically improves the dependence on both $\epsilon$ and $M_c^{(k)}$ in the
best case when $M_f^{(k)}\ll M_c^{(k)}$ and on $\epsilon$ alone in the worst
case when $M_f^{(k)}$ is close to $M_c^{(k)}$.

collective Rydberg atomic excitations in a cold atomic ensemble. By measuring
the dynamics of the stored Rydberg polaritons, we experimentally demonstrate
that storing a probe pulse as Rydberg polaritons strongly enhances the Rydberg
mediated interaction compared to the slow propagation case. We show that the
process is characterized by two time scales. At short storage times, we observe
a strong enhancement of the interaction due to the reduction of the Rydberg
polariton group velocity down to zero. For longer storage times, we observe a
further, weaker enhancement dominated by Rydberg induced dephasing of the
multiparticle components of the state. In this regime, we observe a non-linear
dependence of the Rydberg polariton coherence time with the input photon

of individual GaN/AlN Quantum Disks (QDisks) embedded into GaN nanowires (NW).
The structural and optical properties of the QDisks were probed by high spatial
resolution cathodoluminescence (CL) in a scanning transmission electron
microscope (STEM). By exciting the QDisks with a nanometric electron beam at
currents spanning over 3 orders of magnitude, strong non-linearities (energy
shifts) in the light emission are observed. In particular, we find that the
amount of energy shift depends on the emission rate and on the QDisk morphology
(size, position along the NW and shell thickness). For thick QDisks (&gt;4nm), the
QDisk emission energy is observed to blue-shift with the increase of the
emission intensity. This is interpreted as a consequence of the increase of
carriers density excited by the incident electron beam inside the QDisks, which
screens the internal electric field and thus reduces the quantum confined Stark
effect (QCSE) present in these QDisks. For thinner QDisks (&lt;3 nm), the
blue-shift is almost absent in agreement with the negligible QCSE at such
sizes. For QDisks of intermediate sizes there exists a current threshold above
which the energy shifts, marking the transition from unscreened to partially
screened QCSE. From the threshold value we estimate the lifetime in the
unscreened regime. These observations suggest that, counterintuitively,
electrons of high energy can behave ultimately as single electron-hole pair
generators. In addition, when we increase the current from 1 pA to 10 pA the
light emission efficiency drops by more than one order of magnitude. This
reduction of the emission efficiency is a manifestation of the efficiency droop
as observed in nitride-based 2D light emitting diodes, a phenomenon tentatively
attributed to the Auger effect.

problem with numerous applications, e.g., in quantum information processing.
The problem is even more challenging in the setting of open quantum systems,
where environment-mediated transitions introduce additional decoherence
channels. Adiabatic passage is a well established solution, but requires a
sufficiently slow evolution time that is dictated by the adiabatic theorem.
Here we develop a systematic projection theory formulation for the
transitionless evolution of general open quantum systems described by
time-local master equations. We derive a time-convolutionless dynamical
equation for the target instantaneous eigenstate of a given time-dependent
Hamiltonian. A transitionless dynamics then arises in terms of a competition
between the average Hamiltonian gap and the decoherence rate, which implies
optimal adiabaticity timescales. We show how eigenstate tracking can be
accomplished via control pulses, without explicitly incorporating
counter-diabatic driving, thus offering an alternative route to shortcuts to
adiabaticity. We examine rectangular pulses, chaotic signals, and white noise,
and find that, remarkably, the effectiveness of eigenstate tracking hardly
depends on the details of the control functions. In all cases the control
protocol keeps the system in the desired instantaneous eigenstate throughout
the entire evolution, along an accelerated adiabatic path.

from very specific properties of classical information, which break down in the

  Annealer</title><description>  For randomly selected couplers and fields, the D-Wave device typically yields
a highly Boltzmann like distribution [ indicating equilibration. These
equilibrated data however do not contain much useful information about the
dynamics which lead to equilibration. To illuminate the dynamics, special
Hamiltonians can be chosen which contain large energy barriers. In this paper
we generalize this approach by considering a class of Hamiltonians which map
clusters of spin-like qubits into 'superspins', thereby creating an energy
landscape where local minima are separated by large energy barriers. These
large energy barriers allow us to observe signatures of the transverse field
frozen. To study these systems, we assume that the these frozen spins are
describes by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism which was originally developed to
describe formation of topological defects in the early universe. It was soon
realized that it also has applications in analogous superconductor systems and
later realized to also be important for the transverse field Ising model . We
demonstrate that these barriers block equilibration and yield a non-trivial
distribution of qubit states in a regime where quantum effects are expected to
be strong, suggesting that these data should contain signatures of whether the
dynamics are fundamentally classical or quantum. We exhaustively study a class
of 3x3 square lattice superspin Hamiltonians and compare the experimental
results with those obtained by exact diagonalisation. We find that the best fit
to the data occurs at finite transverse field. We further demonstrate that
under the right conditions, the superspins can be relaxed to equilibrium,
erasing the signature of the transverse field. These results are interesting
for a number of reasons. They suggest a route to detect signatures of quantum
mechanics on the device on a statistical level.

anisotropic XY model with an alternating transverse magnetic field, which is
equivalent to a two-component one-dimensional Fermi gas on a lattice, a system
realizable with current technology. Apart from the antiferromagnetic and
paramagnetic phases, the model possesses a dimer phase which is not present in
the transverse XY model. At zero temperature, we find that the first derivative
of bipartite entanglement can detect all the three phases. We analytically show
that the model has a factorization line on the plane of system parameters, in
which the zero temperature state is separable. Along with investigating the
effect of temperature on entanglement in a phase plane, we also report a
non-monotonic behavior of entanglement with respect to temperature in the
anti-ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases, which is surprisingly absent in the
dimer phase. Since the time dynamics of entanglement in a realizable physical
system plays an important role in quantum information processing tasks, the
evolutions of entanglement at small as well as large time are examined.
Consideration of large time behavior of entanglement helps us to prove that in
this model, entanglement is always ergodic. We observe that other quantum
correlation measures can qualitatively show similar features in zero and finite
temperatures. However, unlike nearest neighbor entanglement, the
nearest-neighbor information theoretic measures can be both ergodic as well as
non-ergodic, depending on the system parameters.

We give a rigorous derivation of this defect's ground state spin and strain

  the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence</title><description>  One of the many remarkable properties of conformal field theory in two
dimensions is its connection to algebraic geometry. Since every compact Riemann
surface is a projective algebraic curve, many constructions of interest in
physics (which a priori depend on the analytic structure of the spacetime) can
be formulated in purely algebraic language. This opens the door to interesting
generalizations, obtained by taking another choice of field: for instance, the
$p$-adics. We generalize the AdS/CFT correspondence according to this
principle; the result is a formulation of holography in which the bulk geometry
is discrete---the Bruhat--Tits tree for $\mathrm{PGL}(2,\mathbb{Q}_p)$---but
the group of bulk isometries nonetheless agrees with that of boundary conformal
transformations and is not broken by discretization. We suggest that this forms
the natural geometric setting for tensor networks that have been proposed as
models of bulk reconstruction via quantum error correcting codes; in certain
cases, geodesics in the Bruhat--Tits tree reproduce those constructed using
quantum error correction. Other aspects of holography also hold: Standard
holographic results for massive free scalar fields in a fixed background carry
over to the tree, whose vertical direction can be interpreted as a
renormalization-group scale for modes in the boundary CFT. Higher-genus bulk
geometries (the BTZ black hole and its generalizations) can be understood
straightforwardly in our setting, and the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for the

general noise if -- and only if -- the error in each physical qubit operation

quantified by their diamond norm. Until now, qubits have been assessed
primarily by randomized benchmarking (RB), which reports a different &quot;error

diamond norm thresholds, and cannot efficiently certify a qubit for FTQEC. We

complete theory of the orbital states of Ge donor electrons, and use it to show
that Ge could have significant advantages over silicon in the implementation of

Further, exchange coupling between neighboring donor qubits is shown to be much
larger in Ge than in Si, and we show that this greatly relaxes the precision in
donor placement needed for robust two-qubit gates. To do this we compare two
statistical distributions for Ge:P and Si:P pair couplings, corresponding to
realistic donor implantation misplacement, and find that the spin couplings in
Ge:P have a $33\%$ chance of being within an order of magnitude of the largest
coupling, compared with only $10\%$ for the Si:P donors. This allows fast,

develop an axiomatic framework from which we deduce the natural form of a
discrete-variable EPI and an associated entropic monotonicity in a
discrete-variable central limit theorem. In this discrete EPI, the geometric
distribution, which has the maximum entropy among all discrete distributions
with a given mean, assumes a role analogous to the Gaussian distribution in
Shannon's EPI. The entropy power of $X$ is defined as the mean of a geometric
random variable with entropy $H(X)$. The crux of our construction is a
discrete-variable version of Lieb's scaled addition $X \boxplus_\eta Y$ of two
discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ with $\eta \in (0, 1)$. We discuss the
relationship of our discrete EPI with recent work of Yu and Johnson who
developed an EPI for a restricted class of random variables that have
ultra-log-concave (ULC) distributions. Even though we leave open the proof of
the aforesaid natural form of the discrete EPI, we show that this discrete EPI
holds true for variables with arbitrary discrete distributions when the entropy
power is redefined as $e^{H(X)}$ in analogy with the continuous version.
Finally, we show that our conjectured discrete EPI is a special case of the

as general communication equilibria, belief-invariant equilibria and correlated
equilibria, all of which contain the familiar Nash equilibria. The notion of
belief-invariant equilibrium has appeared in game theory before, in the 1990s.
However, the class of non-signalling correlations associated to
belief-invariance arose naturally already in the 1980s in the foundations of
quantum mechanics.
  In the present work, we explain and unify these two origins of the idea and
study the above classes of equilibria, and furthermore quantum correlated
equilibria, using tools from quantum information but the language of game
theory. We present a general framework of belief-invariant communication
equilibria, which contains (quantum) correlated equilibria as special cases.
Our framework also contains the theory of Bell inequalities, a question of
intense interest in quantum mechanics and the original motivation for the
above-mentioned studies.
  We then use our framework to show new results related to social welfare.
Namely, we exhibit a game where belief-invariance is socially better than
correlated equilibria, and one where all non-belief-invariant equilibria are
socially suboptimal. Then, we show that in some cases optimal social welfare is
achieved by quantum correlations, which do not need an informed mediator to be
implemented. Furthermore, we illustrate potential practical applications: for
instance, situations where competing companies can correlate without exposing
their trade secrets, or where privacy-preserving advice reduces congestion in a
network. Along the way, we highlight open questions on the interplay between
quantum information, cryptography, and game theory.

teleportations. Because of technology limitations which do not allow large
quantum computers to work as a single processing element, distributed quantum
computation is an appropriate solution to overcome this difficulty. Previous
studies have applied ad-hoc solutions to distribute a quantum system for
special cases and applications. In this study, a general approach is proposed

subsystems are considered and for each of these configurations, the proposed

Finally, the configuration which leads to the minimum number of teleportations
is reported. The proposed method can be used as an automated procedure to find
the configuration with the optimal communication cost for the DQC.

pre-shared entanglement) at most $n+O(\sqrt{n})$ bits or $n+4$ qubits of
communication are required. These provide new methods for implementing
distributed CNOT or controlled-Z gates in parallel whilst minimizing the amount
of communication. While evaluating a function cleanly is harder to perform than
just computing the function, it can always be done using at most $2n$ bits of
communication for functions of $n$-bit strings. In contrast to the Inner
Product, we show that nearly all Boolean functions require close to the maximal
$2n$ bits of classical communication to compute cleanly.

acoustic phenomenon of guiding a wave by a curved boundary observed nearly a
century ago. This phenomenon was later realized to have a rather general
nature, equally applicable to sound and all other waves, but in particular also
to electromagnetic waves ranging from radio frequencies to ultraviolet light.
Very high quality factors of optical WGM resonators persisting in a wide
wavelength range, their small mode volume, and tunable in- and out- coupling
make them exceptionally efficient for nonlinear optical applications. Nonlinear
optics facilitates interaction of photons with each other and with other
physical systems, and is of prime importance in quantum optics. In this paper
we review numerous applications of WGM resonators in nonlinear and quantum
optics. We outline the current areas of interest, summarize progress, highlight

In a circuit QED system irradiated by two pump tones, we engineer an effective

Applying randomized benchmarking to measurement-based quantum computation
exhibits an interesting interplay between the inherent randomness associated

show that in addition to the usual boost generator, there is a contribution to
the modular Hamiltonian at first order in the shape deformation, proportional
to the integral of the null components of the stress tensor along the Rindler

the averaged null energy condition in Minkowski space-time. This subsequently
gives a new proof of the Hofman-Maldacena bounds on the parameters appearing in
CFT three-point functions. Our main technical advance involves adapting newly

the shape dependence of entanglement in CFTs and here we generalize these

Optimal quantum protocols for this task have been given by Aharon and Silman

protocols which are currently very complicated and not very well understood. In
this paper, we first present very simple classical protocols for die-rolling

  spontaneous multimerization</title><description>  We introduce a one-dimensional (1D) pseudospin model on a ladder where the
Ising interactions along the legs and along the rungs alternate between
$X_{i}X_{i+1}$ and $Z_{i}Z_{i+1}$ for even/odd bond (rung). We include also the
next nearest neighbor Ising interactions on plaquettes' diagonals that
alternate in such a way that a model where only leg interactions are switched
on is equivalent to the one when only the diagonal ones are present. Thus in
the absence of rung interactions the model can interpolate between two 1D
compass models. The model posses local symmetries which are the parities within
each $2\times 2$ cell (plaquette) of the ladder. We find that for different
values of the interaction it can realize ground states that differ by the
patterns formed by these local parities. By exact diagonalization we derive
detailed phase diagrams for small systems of $L=4$, 6 and 8 plaquettes, and use
next $L=12$ to identify generic phases that appear in larger systems as well.
Among them we find a nematic phase with macroscopic degeneracy when the leg and
diagonal interactions are equal and the rung interactions are larger than a
critical value. The nematic phase is similar to the one found in the
two-dimensional compass model. For particular parameters the low-energy sector
of the present plaquette model reduces to a 1D compass model with spins $S=1$
which suggests that it realizes peculiar crossovers within the class of compass
models. Finally, we show that the model can realize phases with broken
translation invariance which can be either dimerized, trimerized,
\textit{etcetera}, or completely disordered and highly entangled in a~well
identified window of the phase diagram.

that the computational cost grows exponentially with the size of the matrix
increases. So far, there exist a few classical algorithms to compute the matrix
permanents in deterministic and in randomized ways. By exploiting the series
expansion of products of boson operators regarding collective boson operators,
a generalized algorithm for computing permanents is developed that the
algorithm can handle the arbitrary matrices with repeated columns and rows. In
a particular case, the formula is reduced to Glynn's form. Not only the
algorithm can be used for a deterministic direct calculation of the matrix
permanent but also can be expressed as a sampling problem like Gurvits's

in which photons are input within the network itself, as a means to approach
this goal. When using heralded single-photon sources based on parametric
down-conversion, this approach offers an $\sim e$-fold enhancement in the input
state generation rate over scattershot boson sampling, reaching the scaling
limit for such sources. More significantly, this approach offers a dramatic
increase in the signal-to-noise ratio with respect to higher-order photon
generation from such probabilistic sources, which removes the need for photon

spin models since most of the real materials could be well described by
Heisenberg type models. Here we propose an exact quantum decoration
transformation and also showing interesting properties such as the persistence
of symmetry and the symmetry breaking during this transformation. Although the
proposed transformation, in principle, cannot be used to map exactly a quantum
spin lattice model into another quantum spin lattice model, since the operators
are non-commutative. However, it is possible the mapping in the &quot;classical&quot;
limit, establishing an equivalence between both quantum spin lattice models. To
study the validity of this approach for quantum spin lattice model, we use the
Zassenhaus formula, and we verify how the correction could influence the
decoration transformation. But this correction could be useless to improve the
quantum decoration transformation because it involves the
second-nearest-neighbor and further nearest neighbor couplings, which leads
into a cumbersome task to establish the equivalence between both lattice
models. This correction also gives us valuable information about its
contribution, for most of the Heisenberg type models, this correction could be
irrelevant at least up to the third order term of Zassenhaus formula. This
transformation is applied to a finite size Heisenberg chain, comparing with the
exact numerical results, our result is consistent for weak xy-anisotropy
coupling. We also apply to bond-alternating Ising-Heisenberg chain model,
obtaining an accurate result in the limit of the quasi-Ising chain.

  Classical and quantum systems are treated as distinct types, of which the
respective behavioural properties are specified in terms of processes and their
compositions. In particular, classicality is witnessed by 'spiders' which fuse
together whenever they connect. We define mixedness and show that pure
processes are extremal in the space of all processes, and we define
entanglement and show that quantum theory indeed exhibits entanglement. We
discuss the classification of tripartite qubit entanglement and show that both
the GHZ-state and the W-state come from spider-like families of processes,
which differ only in how they behave when they are connected by two or more
wires. We define measurements and provide fully-comprehensive descriptions of
several quantum protocols involving classical data flow. Finally, we give a
notion of 'genuine quantumness', from which special processes called 'phase

In particular, the entanglement spectrum holds a great promise to characterize
essential physics of quantum many-body systems. While there has been a surge of
theoretical works on the subject, no experimental measurement has been
performed to this date, due to the lack of an implementable measurement scheme.
Here, we propose a measurement protocol to access the entanglement spectrum of
many-body states in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices. Our scheme
effectively performs a Ramsey spectroscopy of the entanglement Hamiltonian, and
is based on the ability to produce several copies of the state under
investigation together with the possibility to perform a global swap gate
between two copies conditioned on the state of an auxiliary qubit. We show how
the required conditional swap gate can be implemented with cold atoms, either
by using Rydberg interactions or coupling the atoms to a cavity mode. We
illustrate these ideas on a simple (extended) Bose-Hubbard model where such a
measurement protocol reveals topological features of the Haldane phase.

analytical expressions for the quasienergies and Floquet states of the driven

follows the instantaneous Floquet states, which acquire dynamical phases that
depend on the evolution of the quasienergies over time. The difference between
the phases acquired by the two Floquet states corresponds to a qubit state
rotation, generalizing the notion of Rabi oscillations to the case of large
driving amplitudes. If the pulse amplitude changes very fast, the evolution is
non-adiabatic, with transitions taking place between the Floquet states. We
quantify and analyze the nonadiabatic transitions during the pulse by employing
adiabatic perturbation theory and exact numerical simulations. We find that,
for certain combinations of pulse rise and fall times and maximum driving
amplitude, a destructive interference effect leads to a remarkably strong
suppression of transitions between the Floquet states. This effect provides the

explicit form for layer-layer entanglement Hamiltonian whose spectrum is
entanglement spectrum. We demonstrate that in the absence of trigonal warping,
at zero on-site energy difference exact correspondence is established between
entanglement spectrum and energy spectrum of monolayer which means that the
entanglement spectrum perfectly reflects the edge state properties of the
bilayer. We also show that trigonal warping breaks down such a perfect
correspondence, however, in $\Gamma$-K direction in hexagonal Brillouin zone,
their behaviors are remarkably the same for particular relevances of hopping
parameters. In the presence of an on-site energy difference the symmetry of
entanglement spectrum is broken with opening an indirect entanglement gap. We
also study the effects of a perpendicular magnetic field on both energy and the
entanglement spectrum of the bilayer in the presence of trigonal warping and
on-site energy difference. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum versus
magnetic flux has a self similar fractal structure, known Hofstadter butterfly.
Our results also show that the on-site energy difference causes a transition
from the Hofstadter butterfly to a tree-like picture.

  control of polariton absorption</title><description>  The ability to feed energy into a system, or - equivalently - to drive that
system with an external input is a fundamental aspect of light-matter
interaction. The key concept in many photonic applications is the &quot;critical
coupling&quot; condition: at criticality, all the energy fed to the system via an
input channel is dissipated within the system itself. Although this idea was
crucial to enhance the efficiency of many devices, it was never considered in
the context of systems operating in a non-perturbative regime. In this
so-called strong coupling regime, the matter and light degrees of freedom are
in fact mixed into dressed states, leading to new eigenstates called
polaritons. Here we demonstrate that the strong coupling regime and the
critical coupling condition can indeed coexist; in this situation, which we
term strong critical coupling, all the incoming energy is converted into
polaritons. A semiclassical theory - equivalently applicable to acoustics or
mechanics - reveals that the strong critical coupling corresponds to a special
curve in the phase diagram of the coupled light-matter oscillators. In the more
general case of a system radiating via two scattering ports, the phenomenology
displayed is that of coherent perfect absorption (CPA), which is then naturally
understood and described in the framework of critical coupling. Most
importantly, we experimentally verify polaritonic CPA in a semiconductor-based
intersubband-polariton photonic-crystal membrane resonator. This result opens
new avenues in the exploration of polariton physics, making it possible to
control the pumping efficiency of a system almost independently of its Rabi
energy, i.e., of the energy exchange rate between the electromagnetic field and
the material transition.

  generalising Wigner's argument</title><description>  Bell-type local realist inequalities are developed for demonstrating quantum
nonlocality of bipartite entangled qutrit states by generalizing Wigner's
argument that was originally formulated for the bipartite qubit singlet state.
This treatment is based upon assuming existence of the overall joint
probability distributions for the measurement outcomes pertaining to the
relevant trichotomic observables, satisfying the locality condition, and
yielding the measurable marginal probabilities. We first show that such
generalized Wigner inequalities (GWI) are violated by quantum mechanics (QM)
for both the bipartite qutrit isotropic and singlet states, thereby revealing
their nonlocality. The efficacy of GWI is also probed by comparing its QM
violation with that obtained for the other two types of local realist
inequalities that have been used for probing nonlocality of entangled bipartite
qutrits. This is done in two different ways, (i) by employing unsharp
measurements, and (ii) by incorporating white noise in the isotropic and
singlet qutrit states. It is shown that in both these cases, GWI outperforms
the other two types of local realist inequalities in terms of the respective QM
violations, by being (i) more robust against the unsharpness of measurement,
and (ii) more tolerant to the white noise incorporated in the states
considered.

characterizes contextuality as &quot;global inconsistency&quot; coupled with &quot;local

This has yielded a logical method of detecting and proving the &quot;global

This provides a uniform framework for local consistency, and lays a foundation
for high-level methods of detecting, proving, and moreover using contextuality

well-approximated by convex combinations of i.i.d. states. Recently, it was
shown that in many quantum information applications a more relaxed de Finetti
reduction (i.e. only a matrix inequality between the symmetric state and one of
de Finetti form) is enough, and that it leads to more concise and elegant
arguments. Here we show several uses and general flexible applicability of a
constrained de Finetti reduction in quantum information theory, which was
recently discovered by Duan, Severini and Winter. In particular we show that
the technique can accommodate other symmetries commuting with the permutation
action, and permutation-invariant linear constraints. We then demonstrate that,
in some cases, it is also fruitful with convex constraints, in particular
separability in a bipartite setting. This is a constraint particularly
interesting in the context of the complexity class $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$ of
interactive quantum Merlin-Arthur games with unentangled provers, and our
results relate to the soundness gap amplification of $\mathrm{QMA}(2)$
protocols by parallel repetition. It is also relevant for the regularization of
certain entropic channel parameters. Finally, we explore an extension to
infinite-dimensional systems, which usually pose inherent problems to de
Finetti techniques in the quantum case.

Calculating dynamic polarizabilities of the two clock levels
$[\text{Xe}]4f^{13}6s^2 (J=7/2)$ and $[\text{Xe}]4f^{13}6s^2 (J=5/2)$ in the
spectral range from $250\,$nm to $1200\,$nm, we suggest the &quot;magic&quot; wavelength
for the optical lattice at $807\,$nm. Frequency shifts due to black-body
radiation (BBR), the van der Waals interaction, the magnetic dipole-dipole
interaction and other effects which can perturb the transition frequency are
calculated. The transition at $1.14\,\mu$m demonstrates low sensitivity to the
BBR shift corresponding to $8\times10^{-17}$ in fractional units at room

optical clocks. The total estimated frequency uncertainty is less than $5

weak measurement and postselected weak measurements against systematic errors.
We show that with a large weak value, the systematic error of a postselected
weak measurement when the probe undergoes decoherence can be significantly

weak value amplification in improving the performance of parameter estimation.
We illustrate the results by an exact numerical simulation of decoherence

R(f o g) = Omega(R(f) RS(g)). It is also a quadratically tight lower bound for

  Using this technique we also show implications for lifting theorems in

large system in one of its eigenstates, the reduced density matrix describing
any finite subsystem is determined solely by a set of {\it relevant} conserved
quantities. In a generic system, only the energy plays that role and hence
eigenstates appear locally thermal. Integrable systems, on the other hand,
possess an extensive number of such conserved quantities and hence the reduced
density matrix requires specification of an infinite number of parameters
(Generalized Gibbs Ensemble). However, here we show by unbiased statistical
sampling of the individual eigenstates with a given finite energy density, that
the local description of an overwhelming majority of these states of even such
an integrable system is actually Gibbs-like, i.e. requires only the energy
density of the eigenstate. Rare eigenstates that cannot be represented by the
Gibbs ensemble can also be sampled efficiently by our method and their local
properties are then shown to be described by appropriately {\it truncated}
Generalized Gibbs Ensembles. We further show that the presence of these rare
eigenstates differentiates the model from the generic (non-integrable) case and
leads to the system being described by a Generalized Gibbs Ensemble at long
time under a unitary dynamics following a sudden quench, even when the initial

to the case of two laser beams resonant with the energy differences between two
excited levels and the ground state (three level atom in V-configuration). We
use a novel approach of this type of problem by considering Kolmogorov equation
for the probability distribution of the atomic state which takes into account
first the deterministic evolution of this state under the effect of the
incoming laser beam and the random emission of photons during the spontaneous
decay of the excited state(s) to the ground state. This approach yields
solvable equations in the two level atom case. For the three level atom case we
set the problem and define clearly its frame. The results obtained are valid
both in the opposite limits of rare and of frequent spontaneous decay, compared
to the period of the optical Rabi oscillations due to the interaction between
the resonant excitation and the atomic levels. Our theory gives access to
various statistical properties of the fluorescence light, including one showing
that its fluctuations in time are not invariants under time reversal. This

measurement dependence to correlate multiple runs of the experiment, going
beyond previous studies that considered independent and identically distributed
(i.i.d.) runs. To do so, we study the polytope that defines block-i.i.d.
measurement-dependent local models. We prove that non-i.i.d. models are
strictly more powerful than i.i.d. ones, and comment on the relevance of this
work for the study of randomness amplification in simple Bell scenarios with
suitably optimised inequalities.

have led to exciting advances in the study of quantum information and quantum
many-body systems. The light shifts of atomic levels from the trapping
potential in these systems can result in detrimental effects such as
fluctuating dipole force heating, inhomogeneous detunings, and inhibition of
laser cooling, which limits the atomic species that can be manipulated. In
particular, these light shifts can be large enough to prevent loading into
optical tweezers directly from a magneto-optical trap. We present a general
solution to these limitations by loading, cooling, and imaging single atoms
with temporally alternating beams. Because this technique does not depend on
any specific spectral properties, we expect it to enable the optical tweezer
method to control nearly any atomic or molecular species that can be laser
cooled and optically trapped. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the role
of heating and required cooling for single atom tweezer loading.

  game</title><description>  To date all self-tests for high dimensional systems are confined to
many-qubit states. This is due to two restrictions in the literature: the
standard techniques for proving self-testing results apply only to qubits, and
there are few suitable non-local games that are known to require high
dimensional non-qubit states to achieve their optimal quantum value. In this
paper we address these two problems. Specifically, we generalize the usual
self-testing framework to q$d$its and then apply it to a generalization of the
magic square game, giving a self-test for two maximally entangled pairs of
q$d$its. This self-test has two parties, perfect completeness for honest

  field</title><description>  Recently it was shown that the quantum behavior of an intense cavity field
can be revealed by measuring the steady atomic correlations between two ideal
atoms, which interact with the same leaking cavity mode. Considering weak
atom-field coupling regime and large average number of photons in the cavity
mode ($\bar{n}$), one expects that a semiclassical theory could explain the
whole dynamics of the system. However, this system presents the generation of
correlations between the atoms, which is a signature of the quantumness of the
cavity field even in the limit of $\bar{n} \gg 1$ [Phys. Rev. Lett.
\textbf{107}, 153601 (2011)]. Here, we extend this result by investigating the
relaxation time for such a system. We have shown that the relaxation time of
the system varies proportionally to $\bar{n}$ for a coherent driving, but
inversely proportional to $\bar{n}$ for an incoherent pumping. Thus, the time
required to observe the manifestation of the quantum aspects of a cavity field
on the atomic correlations diverges as $\bar{n}$ tends to macroscopic values
due to a coherent driving, while goes to zero for incoherent pumping. For a
coherent driving, we can also see that this system presents metastability,
i.e., firstly the atomic system reaches a quasi-stationary state which last for
a long time interval, but eventually it reaches the real steady state. We have
also discussed the effects of small atomic decay. In this case, the steady
correlations between the atoms disappear for long times, but the intense cavity
field is still able to generate atomic correlations at intermediate times.
Then, considering a real scenario, we would be able to monitor the quantumness
of a cavity field in a certain time interval.

the component codes, we can get several classes of dual-containing TPCs. By
selecting di?erent component codes, the proposed method enables the
construction of a large family of QTPCs and they can provide the similar
quantum error control abilities as the corresponding classical TPCs. In
particular, if one of the component codes is selected as a burst
error-correction code, then QTPCs have multiple quantum burst error-correction
abilities, provided these bursts fall in distinct subblocks. Compared with
concatenated quantum codes (CQC), the component code selections of QTPCs are
much more exible than those of CQCs since only one of the component codes of
QTPCs needs to satisfy the dual-containing restriction. Furthermore, we show
that it is possible to construct QTPCs with parameters better than other
classes of quantum error-correction codes (QECC), e.g., CQCs and quantum BCH
codes. It is known that classical TPCs cannot have parameters better than
classical BCH codes. However, we show that QTPCs can have better parameters
than quantum BCH codes. Many QTPCs are obtained with parameters better than

asking which Gaussian unitary transformations are reachable by turning on and
off a given set of quadratic Hamiltonians. For compact groups, including finite
dimensional unitary groups, the well known Lie algebra rank criterion provides
a sufficient and necessary condition for the reachable set to cover the whole
group. Because of the non-compact nature of the symplectic group, which
corresponds to Gaussian unitary transformations, this criterion turns out to be
still necessary but not sufficient for Gaussian systems. If the control
Hamiltonians are unstable, in a sense made rigorous in the main text, the
peculiar situation may arise where the rank criterion is satisfied and yet not
all symplectic transformations are reachable. Here, we address this situation
for one degree of freedom and study the properties of the reachable set under
unstable control Hamiltonians. First, we provide a partial analytical
characterisation of the reachable set and prove that no orthogonal
(`energy-preserving' or `passive' in the literature) symplectic operations may
be reached with such controls. Then, we apply numerical optimal control
algorithms to demonstrate a complete characterisation of the set in specific
cases.

image processing algorithms. Many quantum image processing schemes claim that
their efficiency are theoretically higher than their corresponding classical
schemes. However, most of them do not consider the problem of measurement. As
we all know, measurement will lead to collapse. That is to say, executing the
algorithm once, users can only measure the final state one time. Therefore, if
users want to regain the results (the processed images), they must execute the
algorithms many times and then measure the final state many times to get all
the pixels' values. If the measurement process is taken into account, whether
or not the algorithms are really efficient needs to be reconsidered. In this
paper, we try to solve the problem of measurement and give a quantum image
matching algorithm. Unlike most of the QIP algorithms, our scheme interests
only one pixel (the target pixel) instead of the whole image. It modifies the
probability of pixels based on Grover's algorithm to make the target pixel to
be measured with higher probability, and the measurement step is executed only
once. An example is given to explain the algorithm more vividly. Complexity
analysis indicates that the quantum scheme's complexity is $O(2^{n})$ in
contradistinction to the classical scheme's complexity $O(2^{2n+2m})$, where
$m$ and $n$ are integers related to the size of images.

introduced to enable non-consecutive fermionic couplings to be simulated with
constant low-rank tensor products on spins. We connect the auxiliary fermion

Architectures with ten or more quantum bits (qubits) have been realized using
trapped ions and superconducting circuits. While these implementations are
potentially scalable, true scalability will require systems engineering to
combine quantum and classical hardware. One technology demanding imminent
efforts is the realization of a suitable wiring method for the control and

socket fully exploits the third dimension to connect classical electronics to
qubits with higher density and better performance than two-dimensional methods
based on wire bonding. The quantum socket is based on spring-mounted micro
wires the three-dimensional wires that push directly on a micro-fabricated
chip, making electrical contact. A small wire cross section (~1 mmm), nearly
non-magnetic components, and functionality at low temperatures make the quantum
socket ideal to operate solid-state qubits. The wires have a coaxial geometry
and operate over a frequency range from DC to 8 GHz, with a contact resistance
of ~150 mohm, an impedance mismatch of ~10 ohm, and minimal crosstalk. As a
proof of principle, we fabricated and used a quantum socket to measure
superconducting resonators at a temperature of ~10 mK.

concurrently bringing together the main ingredients for realizing many-body

The nucleon densities of the RMF theory contradict to knowledge about

classical states. On the other hand, nonlinear and generalised coherent states
may possess nonclassical properties. In this article, we study the nonclassical
behaviour of nonlinear coherent states for generalised classes of models
corresponding to the generalised ladder operators. A comparative analysis among
them indicates that the models with quadratic spectrum are more nonclassical
than the others. Our central result is further underpinned by the comparison of
the degree of nonclassicality of squeezed states of the corresponding models.

observable properties and the dynamical response of systems to various
interactions. However, quantum theory separates the observable part of physics
from the unobservable time evolution by introducing mathematical objects that
are only loosely connected to the actual physics by statistical concepts and
cannot be explained by any conventional sets of events. Here, I examine the
relation between statistics and dynamics in quantum theory and point out that
the Hilbert space formalism can be understood as a theory of ergodic
randomization, where the deterministic laws of motion define probabilities
according to a randomization of the dynamics that occurs in the processes of
state preparation and measurement.

a joint probability distribution for all output combinations that can be
explained in terms of an initial joint quasi-probability of the non-commuting
observables, modified by the resolution errors and back-action of the initial
measurement. Here, we show that the error statistics of a sequential
measurement of photon polarization performed at different measurement strengths
can be described consistently by an imaginary correlation between the
statistics of resolution and back-action. The experimental setup was designed
to realize variable strength measurements with well-controlled imaginary
correlation between the statistical errors caused by the initial measurement of
diagonal polarizations, followed by a precise measurement of the
horizontal/vertical polarization. We perform the experimental characterization
of an elliptically polarized input state and show that the same complex joint
probability distribution is obtained at any measurement strength.

may be applied in arbitrary geometries, and it corresponds exactly to one
polarization of the electromagnetic field in planar layered media. Starting
from the field theory for electromagnetism, we work with the two decoupled
polarizations in planar media and develop worldline path integrals, which
represent the two polarizations separately, for computing both Casimir and
Casimir-Polder potentials. We then show analytically that the path integrals
for the transverse-electric (TE) polarization coupled to a dielectric medium
converge to the proper solutions in certain special cases, including the
Casimir-Polder potential of an atom near a planar interface, and the Casimir
energy due to two planar interfaces. We also evaluate the path integrals
numerically via Monte-Carlo path-averaging for these cases, studying the
convergence and performance of the resulting computational techniques. While
these scalar methods are only exact in particular geometries, they may serve as
an approximation for Casimir energies for the vector electromagnetic field in
other geometries.

We record cavity-enhanced fluorescence images and study several single emitters

an effective Purcell factor of up to 2.0. With numerical simulations, we
furthermore show that a novel regime for light confinement can be achieved,
where a Fabry-Perot mode is combined with additional mode confinement by the

and quantum steering, between two parties, required trust in at least one of
the parties and their devices, in contrast to the verification of Bell
nonseparability. It has since been shown that this is not the case: the need
for trust, in verifying two parties share a given quantum correlation resource,
can be replaced by quantum refereeing, in which the referee sends quantum
signals rather than classical signals to untrusted parties. The existence of
such quantum-refereed games is discussed, with particular emphasis on how they
make it impossible for the parties to cheat. The example of a particular
quantum-refereed steering game is used to show explicitly how
measurement-device independence is achieved via `quantum programming' of
untrusted measurement devices; how cheating is prevented by the steered party
being unable to distinguish sufficiently well between two sets of nonorthogonal
signal states; and that cheating remains impossible when one-way communication
is allowed from the steered party to the unsteered party. This game has been
recently implemented experimentally, and is of particular interest both in
accounting for any imperfections in the referee's preparation of signal states,

  theory: Application to ultracold atoms in a harmonic trap</title><description>  We develop a generalized gradient expansion of the inhomogeneous dynamical
mean-field theory method for determining properties of ultracold atoms in a
trap. This approach goes beyond the well-known local density approximation and
at higher temperatures, in the normal phase, it shows why the local density
approximation works so well, since the local density and generalized gradient
approximations are essentially indistinguishable from each other (and from the
exact solution within full inhomogeneous dynamical mean-field theory). But
because the generalized gradient expansion only involves nearest-neighbor
corrections, it does not work as well at low temperatures, when the systems
enter into ordered phases. This is primarily due to the problem that ordered
phases often satisfy some global constraints which determine the spatial
ordering pattern, and the local density and generalized gradient approximations
are not able to impose those kinds of constraints; they also overestimate the
tendency to order. The theory is applied to phase separation of different mass
fermionic mixtures represented by the Falicov-Kimball model and to determining
the entropy per particle of a fermionic system represented by the Hubbard
model. The generalized gradient approximation is a useful diagnostic for the
accuracy of the local density approximation---when both methods agree, they are
likely accurate, when they disagree, neither is likely to be correct.

using interaction between the Rydberg atoms during the storage and retrieval of
slow light. A distinctive feature of the suggested procedure is that the slow
light is stored into a superposition of two atomic coherences under conditions
of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Interaction between the
atoms during the storage period creates entangled pairs of atoms in a
superposition state that is orthogonal to the initially stored state. Restoring
the slow light from this new atomic state one can produce a two photon state
with a second-order correlation function determined by the atom-atom
interaction and the storage time. Therefore the measurement of the restored
light allows one to probe the atom-atom coupling by optical means with a
sensitivity that can be increased by extending the storage time. As a
realization of this idea we consider a many-body Ramsey-type technique which
involves pi/2 pulses creating a superposition of Rydberg states at the
beginning and the end of the storage period. In that case the regenerated light
is due to the resonance dipole-dipole interaction between the atoms in the
Rydberg states.

highly-coherent 3D transmon qubits, collectively coupled to a high-Q
superconducting microwave cavity. As a demonstration, we enact all seven
nontrivial subset-parity measurements on our three-qubit register. For each we
fully characterize the realized measurement by analyzing the detector
(observable operators) via quantum detector tomography and by analyzing the
quantum back-action via conditioned process tomography. No single quantity
completely encapsulates the performance of a measurement, and standard figures
of merit have not yet emerged. Accordingly, we consider several new fidelity
measures for both the detector and the complete measurement process. We measure
all of these quantities and report high fidelities, indicating that we are
measuring the desired quantities precisely and that the measurements are highly
non-demolition. We further show that both results are improved significantly by
an additional error-heralding measurement. The analyses presented here form a
useful basis for the future characterization and validation of quantum
measurements, anticipating the demands of emerging quantum technologies.

  silicon</title><description>  The long term scaling prospects for solid-state quantum computing
architectures relies heavily on the ability to simply and reliably measure and
control the coherent electron interaction strength, known as the tunnel
coupling, $t_c$. Here, we describe a method to extract the $t_c$ between two
quantum dots (QDs) utilising their different tunnel rates to a reservoir. We
demonstrate the technique on a few donor triple QD tunnel coupled to a nearby
single-electron transistor (SET) in silicon. The device was patterned using
scanning tunneling microscopy-hydrogen lithography allowing for a direct
measurement of the tunnel coupling for a given inter-dot distance. We extract
${t}_{{\rm{c}}}=5.5\pm 1.8\;{\rm{GHz}}$ and ${t}_{{\rm{c}}}=2.2\pm
1.3\;{\rm{GHz}}$ between each of the nearest-neighbour QDs which are separated
by 14.5 nm and 14.0 nm, respectively. The technique allows for an accurate
measurement of $t_c$ for nanoscale devices even when it is smaller than the
electron temperature and is an ideal characterisation tool for multi-dot
systems with a charge sensor.

by truncation beyond a number of neighbors and can be tuned to interpolate
between the Calogero-Sutherland model and a system with interactions among

includes the Tonks-Girardeau gas describing impenetrable bosons as well as a
novel extension with truncated interactions. All these systems are exactly

being absorbed in a nontrivial zero-point energy. We characterize the
degeneracies and derive the canonical partition function. While the ground

the density profile and one-body reduced density matrix of the ground state and

  mean field analysis of the phase diagram</title><description>  Ultracold bosonic atoms in optical lattices self-organize into a variety of
structural and quantum phases when placed into a single-mode cavity and pumped
by a laser. Cavity optomechanical effects induce an atom density modulation at
the cavity-mode wave length that competes with the optical lattice arrangement.
Simultaneously short-range interactions via particle hopping promote superfluid
order, such that a variety of structural and quantum coherent phases can occur.
We analyze the emerging phase diagram in two dimensions by means of an extended
Bose-Hubbard model using a local mean field approach combined with a superfluid
cluster analysis. For commensurate ratios of the cavity and external lattice
wave lengths the Mott insulator-superfluid transition is modified by the
appearance of charge density wave and supersolid phases, at which the atomic
density supports the buildup of a cavity field. For incommensurate ratios, the
optomechanical forces induce the formation of Bose-glass and superglass phases,
namely non-superfluid and superfluid phases, respectively, displaying
quasi-periodic density modulations, which in addition can exhibit structural
and superfluid stripe formation. The onset of such structures is constrained by
the onsite interaction and is favourable at fractional densities. Experimental
observables are identified and discussed.

approaches. Quantum annealing is one promising candidate. The failure of
annealing dynamics to equilibrate on practical time scales is a well understood
limitation, but does not always prevent a heuristically useful distribution
from being generated. In this paper we evaluate several methods for determining
a useful operational temperature range for annealers. We show that even where
distributions deviate from the Boltzmann distribution due to ergodicity
breaking these estimates can be useful. We introduce the concepts of local and
global temperatures that are captured by different estimation methods. We argue
that for practical application it often makes sense to analyze annealers that
are subject to post-processing in order to isolate the macroscopic distribution
deviations that are a practical barrier to their application.

i.e., its upper bound occurs with separable encoding and separable receivers so
that a single-mode communication suffices to achieve the largest capacity under

Holevo capacity and the capacity within Gaussian communication, showing that
Gaussian regime is not sufficient to achieve the Holevo bound particularly in
the low-photon regime. Furthermore the Gaussian benchmark established here can
be used to critically assess the performance of non-Gaussian protocols for

mechanical switches provide low insertion loss but disturb operation of

Here we design and test an on-chip switch built by combining tunable
transmission-line resonators with microwave beam-splitters. The device is
superconducting and as such dissipates a negligible amount of heat. It is
compatible with current superconducting circuit fabrication techniques,
operates with a bandwidth exceeding $100\,\mathrm{MHz}$, is capable of handling
photon fluxes on the order of $10^{5}\,\mu\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, equivalent to

propagating ancilla qubits and then performing a joint two-qubit measurement on
the ancillas. Subsequently, single-qubit measurements are performed on each of
the ancillas. We describe two continuous variable implementations of the
protocol using propagating microwave modes. The first implementation uses
propagating Schr$\rm{\ddot{o}}$dinger cat-states as the flying ancilla qubits,
a joint-photon-number-modulo-2 measurement of the propagating modes for the
two-qubit measurement and homodyne detections as the final single-qubit
measurements. The presence of inefficiencies in realistic quantum systems limit
the success-rate of generating high fidelity Bell-states. This motivates us to
propose a second continuous variable implementation, where we use quantum error
correction to suppress the decoherence due to photon loss to first order. To
that end, we encode the ancilla qubits in superpositions of Schr\&quot;odinger cat
states of a given photon-number-parity, use a joint-photon-number-modulo-4

single-qubit measurements. We demonstrate the resilience of our

we describe a modification of our error-correcting scheme by incorporating
additional individual photon-number-modulo-2 measurements of the ancilla modes

a qualitative similarity with a time introduced in that liquid-state NMR

color centers, previously reported only in electroluminescence and
cathodoluminescence regime, exhibited two sharp emission lines at 536.5 nm and
560.5 nm, without significant phonon sidebands. A strong correlation between
the PL intensities of the above-mentioned emission lines and the He
implantation fluence was found in the 10^15-10^17 cm^{-2} fluence range. The PL
emission features were not detected in control samples, i.e. samples that were
either unirradiated or irradiated with different ion species (H, C). Moreover,
the PL emission lines disappeared in samples that were He-implanted above the
graphitization threshold. Therefore, the PL features are attributed to
optically active defects in the diamond matrix associated with He impurities.
The intensity of the 536.5 nm and 560.5 nm emission lines was investigated as a
function of the annealing temperature of the diamond substrate. The emission
was observed upon annealing at temperatures higher than 500{\deg}C, at the
expenses of the concurrently decreasing neutral-vacancy-related GR1 emission
intensity. Therefore, our findings indicate that the luminescence originates
from the formation of a stable lattice defect. Finally, the emission was
investigated under different laser excitations wavelengths (i.e. 532 nm and 405
nm) with the purpose of gaining a preliminary insight about the position of the
related levels in the energy gap of diamond.

  four-wave mixing in integrated microresonators</title><description>  Single photon-level quantum frequency conversion has recently been
demonstrated using silicon nitride microring resonators. The resonance
enhancement offered by such systems enables high-efficiency translation of
quantum states of light across wide frequency ranges at sub-watt pump powers.
Using a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian formalism, we present a detailed
theoretical analysis of the conversion dynamics in these systems, and show that
they are capable of converting single- and multi-photon quantum states.
Analytic formulas for the conversion efficiency, spectral conversion
probability density, and pump power requirements are derived which are in good
agreement with previous theoretical and experimental results. We show that with
only modest improvement to the state of the art, efficiencies exceeding 95% are
achievable using less than 100 mW of pump power. At the critical driving
strength that yields maximum conversion efficiency, the spectral conversion
probability density is shown to exhibit a flat-topped peak, indicating a range
of insensitivity to the spectrum of a single photon input. Two alternate
theoretical approaches are presented to study the conversion dynamics: a
dressed mode approach that yields a better intuitive picture of the conversion
process, and a study of the temporal dynamics of the participating modes in the
resonator, which uncovers a regime of Rabi-like coherent oscillations of single
photons between two different frequency modes. This oscillatory regime arises
from the strong coupling of distinct frequency modes mediated by coherent
pumps.

generated from a coherent state of light. The system can exhibit polarization
entanglement if the two parts are distinguished by their parity, or parity
entanglement if the parts are distinguished by polarization. It was shown in
[PRL 110, 140404 (2013)] that this phenomenon can be exploited as a method to
test indistinguishability of two particles and it was conjectured that one can
also test indistinguishability of macroscopic systems. We propose a setup to
test this conjecture. Contrary to the previous studies using two-particle
interference effect as in Hong-Ou- Mandel setup, our setup neither assumes that
the tested state is composed of single particles nor requires that the total
number of particles be fixed. Consequently the notion of entanglement duality
is shown to be compatible with a broader class of physical systems. Moreover,
by observing duality in entanglement in the above system one can confirm that
macroscopic systems exhibit quantum behaviour. As a practical side,
entanglement duality is a useful concept that enables adaptive conversion of

quantum mechanics: the collapse of the wave function becomes a physical
process. We consider the two most promising collapse models, the QMUPL (Quantum
Mechanics with Universal Position Localization) model and the mass-proportional
CSL (Continuous Spontaneous Localization) model, and derive their effect onto
flavour oscillations of neutral mesons. We find that the dynamics of neutral
mesons depends on the very assumptions of the noise field underlying any
collapse model, thus the physics of the noise field becomes investigatable for
these particular systems. Secondly, we find that the decay property of the mass
eigenstates can be dynamically generated by the spontaneous collapse in space.
Taking collapse models seriously we conclude that accelerator facilities have
measured the absolute masses of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian giving raise to
decay; this in turn is at the same footings as the mass difference giving raise
to the flavour oscillations (predicted also by standard quantum mechanics).
Thus dynamical reduction models can cover the full dynamics, oscillation and
decay, of neutral mesons.

However, the distribution of such modes over large distances remains difficult.
Intermodal coupling complicates their use with common fibers, while free-space
transmission is thought to be strongly influenced by atmospheric turbulence.
Here we show the transmission of orbital angular momentum modes of light over a

greater than the maximum distance achieved previously. As a demonstration of
the transmission quality, we use superpositions of these modes to encode a

distinguishing between the different twisted light superpositions. The
algorithm is able to identify different mode superpositions with an accuracy of
more than 80% up to the third mode order, and decode the transmitted message

appears in physics in the form of labels on relativistic fields or Schrodinger
wave functionals, we propose to define Euclidean quantum space as a choice of
polarization for the Heisenberg algebra of quantum theory. We show, following
Mackey, that generically, such polarizations contain a fundamental length scale
and that contrary to what is implied by the Schrodinger polarization, they
possess topologically distinct spectra. These are the modular spaces. We show
that they naturally come equipped with additional geometrical structures
usually encountered in the context of string theory or generalized geometry.
Moreover, we show how modular space reconciles the presence of a fundamental
scale with translation and rotation invariance. We also discuss how the usual
classical notion of space comes out as a form of thermodynamical limit of
modular space while the Schrodinger space is a singular limit.

together with a meter or meters, can be seen as following the paths of a
stochastic network connecting all possible outcomes. The paths are shaped from
the virtual paths of the system, and the corresponding probabilities are
determined by the measuring devices employed. If the measurements are highly
accurate, the virtual paths become &quot;real&quot;, and the mean values of a quantity (a
functional) is directly related to the frequencies with which the paths are
travelled. If the measurements are highly inaccurate, the mean (weak) values
are expressed in terms of the relative probabilities amplitudes. For pre- and
post-selected systems they are bound to take arbitrary values, depending on the
chosen transition. This is a direct consequence of the uncertainty principle,
which forbids one to distinguish between interfering alternatives, while
leaving the interference between them intact.

satellites will be sensitive to the effective Doppler shifts induced by
incident gravitational waves (GWs) at a level competitive with other proposed
space-based GW detectors, while providing complementary features. The detected
signal is a differential frequency shift of the shared laser light due to the
relative velocity of the satellites, rather than a phase shift arising from the
relative satellite positions, and the detection window can be tuned through the
control sequence applied to the atoms' internal states. This scheme enables the
detection of GWs from continuous, spectrally narrow sources, such as compact
binary inspirals, with frequencies ranging from ~3 mHz - 10 Hz without loss of

light intensity limit for atoms with a single electronic ground state, the full
quantum field-theoretical representation of the model can be solved exactly by
means of classical stochastic electrodynamics simulations for stationary atoms
that represent cold atomic ensembles. Simulations for the optical response of
atoms in a quantum degenerate regime require one to synthesize a stochastic
ensemble of atomic positions that generates the corresponding quantum
statistical position correlations between the atoms. In the case of multiple
ground levels or at light intensities where saturation becomes important, the
classical simulations require approximations that neglect quantum fluctuations
between the levels. We show how the model is extended to incorporate

recurrent scattering of light induces strong interatomic correlations. These

both zero and nonzero temperature $T$ the in-plane and out-of-plane
conductivities of graphene are equal to each other with a high precision and
essentially do not depend on the wave vector. At $T=0$ the conductivity of
graphene is real and equal to $\sigma_0=e^2/(4\hbar)$ up to small nonlocal
corrections in accordance with many authors. At some fixed $T\neq 0$ the real
part of the conductivity varies between zero at low frequencies $\omega$ and
$\sigma_0$ for optical $\omega$. If $\omega$ is fixed, the conductivity varies
between $\sigma_0$ at low $T$ and zero at high $T$. The imaginary part of the
conductivity of graphene is shown to depend on the ratio of $\omega$ to $T$. In
accordance to the obtained asymptotic expressions, at fixed $T$ it varies from
infinity at $\omega=0$ to a negative minimum value reached at some $\omega$,
and then approaches to zero with further increase of $\omega$. At fixed
$\omega$ the imaginary part of the conductivity varies from zero at $T=0$,
reaches a negative minimum at some $T$ and then goes to infinity together with
$T$. The numerical computations of both the real and imaginary parts of the

  gate-synthesis with reduced resource cost</title><description>  The standard approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation is to store
information in a quantum error correction code, such as the surface code, and
process information using a strategy that can be summarized as
distill-then-synthesize. In the distill step, one performs several rounds of
distillation to create high-fidelity logical qubits in a magic state. Each such
magic state provides one good $T$ gate. In the synthesize step, one seeks the
optimal decomposition of an algorithm into a sequence of many $T$ gates
interleaved with Clifford gates. This gate-synthesis problem is well understood
for multi-qubit gates that do not use any Hadamards. We present an in-depth
analysis of a unified framework that realises one round of distillation and
multi-qubit gate synthesis in a single step. We call these synthillation
protocols, and show they lead to a large reduction in resource overheads. This
is because synthillation can implement a general class of circuits using the
same number of $T$-states as gate synthesis, yet with the benefit of quadratic
error suppression. Therefore, synthillation removes the need for a costly round
of magic state distillation. We also present several additional results on the
multi-qubit gate-synthesis problem. We provide an efficient algorithm for
synthesising unitaries with the same worst-case resource scaling as optimal
solutions. For the special case of synthesizing controlled-unitaries, our
techniques are not just efficient but exactly optimal. We observe that the
gate-synthesis cost, measured by $T$-count, is often strictly subadditive.
Numerous explicit applications of our techniques are also presented.

probability distributions and as expectation values of multipartite operators.
The latter approach is particularly useful when considering outcomes as
eigenvalues of unitary operators. This brings the possibility of exploiting the
complex structure of the coefficients in the Bell operators. We investigate
this avenue of though in the known case of two outcomes, and find new Bell
inequalities for the cases of three outcomes and $n=3,4,5$ and $6$ parties. We
find their corresponding classical bounds and their maximum violation in the
case of qutrits. We further propose a novel way to generate Bell inequalities
based on a mapping from maximally entangled states to Bell operators and
produce examples for different outcomes and number of parties.

first experimental demonstration of EPR position-momentum entanglement of
narrowband photon pairs generated from cold atoms. By using two-photon quantum

is only given and no design rules are provided, b) the existence of losses is
implicitly assumed, c) the attack has been formulated against qubit based

polarization qubits (PPQs) are controllably released into any one of multiple
separate channels. The PPQs are implemented with an arbitrarily-polarized
coherent signal light pulses at the single-photon level and are stored in cold

pulses propagating along the direction at a small angle relative to quantum
axis are applied to release the stored PPQs into an output channel. By changing
the propagating directions of the read laser beam, we controllably release the
retrieved PPQs into 7 different photonic output channels, respectively. At one

PPQs is 94.2% at storage time of t= 0.85ms. At storage time of 6 ms, the
quantum-process fidelity is still beyond 78%, the threshold for the violation

applying this framework to starting states along a single edge of the graph, we
show that low effective resistance implies oscillatory localization of the

edge-transitive, expander, and high degree graphs. As a corollary, it follows
that high edge-connectivity also implies localization of these states, since it

quantum phenomenon where the walker remains at its initial location with high
probability. In companion with a joint Letter, we introduce oscillatory
localization, where the walker alternates between two states. The walk is given
by the flip-flop shift, which is easily defined on non-lattice graphs, and the
Grover coin. Extremely simple examples of the localization exist, such as a
walker jumping back and forth between two vertices of the complete graph. We
show that only two kinds of states, called flip states and uniform states,
exhibit exact oscillatory localization. So the projection of an arbitrary state
onto these gives a lower bound on the extent of oscillatory localization. Thus
we completely characterize the states that oscillate under the quantum walk.

with static Hamiltonians. For systems with time-varying Hamiltonians, however,
significant difficulty emerges, due to no explicit solution is available for
the dynamics in general. This results in a lack of knowledge about quantum
metrology for these more complex systems so far. In this paper, we investigate
quantum metrology with time-dependent Hamiltonians to bridge this gap. We
obtain the optimal solution to Fisher information, and show that proper
Hamiltonian control gives an advantage in maximizing the Fisher information. We
derive the optimal Hamiltonian control, and with a minimal example of a qubit
in a rotating magnetic field, we find a surprising result that with the
assistance of Hamiltonian control, the fundamental limit of time scaling
$T^{2}$ for Fisher information can be violated with time-dependent
Hamiltonians, which reaches $T^{4}$ in estimating the rotation frequency of the
field. We further consider level crossings in the parametric derivatives of the
Hamiltonians, and point out that additional Hamiltonian control is necessary
for that case.

and achieves resolution scaling as $1/\sqrt{t}$, with $t$ the imaging time. By
contrast, the laws of quantum mechanics allow one to utilize quantum coherence
to obtain imaging resolution that can scale as quickly as $1/t$ -- the
so-called &quot;Heisenberg limit.&quot; However, ambiguities in the obtained signal often
preclude taking full advantage of this quantum enhancement, while imaging
techniques designed to be unambiguous often lose this optimal Heisenberg
scaling. Here, we demonstrate an imaging technique which combines unambiguous
detection of the target with Heisenberg scaling of the resolution. We also
demonstrate a binary search algorithm which can efficiently locate a coherent
target using the technique, resolving a target trapped ion to within 3% of the
$1/e^2$ diameter of the excitation beam.

  (and useful) observables and an application to remote state preparation</title><description>  Understanding how correlations can be used for quantum communication
protocols is a central goal of quantum information science. While many authors
have linked global measures of correlations such as entanglement or discord to
the performance of specific protocols, in general the protocols may require
only on correlations between specific observables. Here, we introduce a
pairwise measure of correlations between local observables, based on the
classical mutual information, and show how it can be used to classify the
quantum states and assess the role of correlations in specific protocols in a
standard way. We exemplify our approach in a two-qubit scenario. We first focus
on states with maximally mixed marginals (MMMS) and show that pairwise
correlations between local observables are complementary to the coherence of
the product bases they define, and that the purity and the symmetry of the
states determines the average correlations. Next, we address the role of
correlations in the remote state preparation protocol (RSP). One can introduce
a proper figure-of-merit for RSP that depends only on a subset of relevant
observables. While for MMMS the corresponding relevant correlations are always
useful, i.e., they can be fruitfully used for RSP, for non-MMMS only a subset
of the relevant correlations has this feature. In both cases, one can define a
gain function that quantifies the benefit of using the useful correlations,
which turns out to coincide with the average correlations between the useful
observables. The gain provides a measure of correlations tied to the specific
protocol and one can show that purity and symmetry are the resources that
determine the overall performance. Optimizing the protocol means maximizing the
useful correlations and thus minimizing the corresponding coherence. The scheme
we propose can be straightforwardly extended to other communication protocols.

the system in discrete units of the driving frequency. We discuss the validity
of Floquet Adiabatic Perturbation Theory (FAPT) using five different models
covering linear and non-linear few and many-particle systems. We argue that in
interacting systems, even in the stable high-frequency regimes, FAPT breaks
down at ultra slow ramp rates due to avoided crossings of Floquet (many-body)

rates. Nevertheless, we find large windows in the ramp rate, for which the

the microwave source frequency $\omega_{\rm MW}$ and the electron spin

which can be made comparable to $\Omega_R$ using frequency modulation on the

Recently, a monogamy relation for the volumes of steering ellipsoids has been
derived for pure 3-qubit states and shown to be stronger than the celebrated
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters (CKW) inequality. We first demonstrate the close
connection between this volume monogamy relation and the classification of pure
3-qubit states under stochastic local operations and classical communication

mixed 3-qubit states and derive a weaker monogamy relation that does hold for
such states. We also prove a volume monogamy relation for pure 4-qubit states,
and generalize our 3-qubit inequality to n qubits. Finally, we study the effect
of noise on the quantum steering ellipsoid and find that the volume of any
two-qubit state is non-increasing when the state is exposed to arbitrary local
noise. This implies that any volume monogamy relation for a given class of
multi-qubit states remains valid under the addition of local noise. We
investigate this quantitatively for the experimentally relevant example of

what determines the observables. We also explain how deterministic classical

a 1+3-dimensional linearized gravity field in the Minkowski background with
Rindler horizons. Although matter crossing a Rindler horizon causes horizon
deformation and a time-dependent coordinate shift, that is, gravitational
memory, the supertranslation and superrotation charges on the horizon can be
defined during and after its passage through the horizon. It is generally
proven that holographic states on the horizon cannot store any information
about absorbed perturbative gravitational waves. However, matter crossing the
horizon really excites holographic states. By using gravitational memory
operators, which consist of the holographic charge operators, we suggest a
resolution of the no-cloning paradox of quantum information between matter
falling into the horizon and holographic charges on the horizon from the
viewpoint of the contextuality of quantum measurement.

  Towards experimental studies of quantum gravity</title><description>  We suggest that the holographic principle, combined with recent technological
advances in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, can lead to experimental
studies of quantum gravity. As a specific example, we consider the
Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, which consists of spin-polarized fermions with
an all-to-all random two-body hopping and has been conjectured to be dual to a
certain quantum gravitational system. We propose that the SYK model can be
engineered by confining ultracold fermionic atoms into optical lattices and
coupling two atoms with molecular states via photo-association lasers.
Achieving low-temperature states of the SYK model is interpreted as a
realization of a stringy black hole, provided that the holographic duality is
true. We also show how to measure out-of-time-order correlation functions of
the SYK model, which allow for identifying the maximally chaotic property of
the black hole.

As an important component of quantum secure communication, deterministic joint
remote state preparation (DJRSP) could securely transmit a quantum state with
100\% success probability. In this paper, we study how the efficiency of DJRSP
is affected when quantum resource involved in the protocol are subjected to
noise or decoherence. Taking a GHZ based DJRSP scheme as an example, we study
all types of noise usually encountered in realworld implementations of quantum
communication protocols, i.e., the bit-flip, phase-flip (phase damping),
depolarizing, and amplitude-damping noise. Our study shows that the fidelity of
the output state depends on the phase factor, the amplitude factor and the
noise parameter in the bit-flip noise, while the fidelity only depends on the
amplitude factor and the noise parameter in the other three types of noise. And
the receiver will get different output states depends on the first preparer's
measurement result in the amplitude-damping noise. Our results will be helpful
for improving quantum secure communication in real implementation.

controlled and formed by a combination of dry and anisotropic wet etching. The
nanowire dimensions are well controlled and can have a very high length/width
aspect ratio of 10 um/5 nm or larger. The transport is controlled by a fringe
gate and shows room temperature quantum transport where gradual filling of 1-D
subbands gets manifested as oscillations in the transconductance. The fringe
gate threshold voltage for depletion of one-dimensional electron gas is found
to increase with increasing drain voltage indicating efficient control of
1-DEG. The transport characteristics and fringe field operation are explained
by taking into account quantum capacitance in addition to the conventional
geometric capacitance. The effect of nanowire width and fringe gate position is

to a time-energy uncertainty relation analogue to the position-momentum one,
conjectured by Heisenberg early on, seemed to exclude the existence of such an
operator. However Dirac's formulation of electron's relativistic quantum

is self-adjoint. Consequently, it can be considered as the generator of a
unitary transformation of the system,as well as an additional system observable
subject to uncertainty. In the present paper these aspects are examined within
the standard framework of RQM.

an exception, we present a quantum algorithm for graph isomorphism testing
whose performance is optimal when operating in the partially coherent regime,
as opposed to the extremes of fully coherent and classical regimes. The
algorithm builds on continuous-time quantum stochastic walks (QSWs) on graphs
and the algorithmic performance is quantified by the distinguishing power
between non-isomorphic graphs. The QSW explores the entire graph and acquires
information about the underlying structure, which is extracted by observing the
counting statistics of stochastic jumps across an ancillary edge. The counting
statistics is used to identify the spectrum of the dynamical generator of the
QSW, serving as a novel graph invariant, based on which non-isomorphic graphs
are distinguished. We provide specific examples of non-isomorphic graphs that
are only distinguishable by observing partially coherent QSWs.

a minimum separation it can resolve between two objects or sources; this limit
is typically defined by &quot;Rayleigh's criterion&quot;, although in recent years there
have been a number of high-profile techniques demonstrating that Rayleigh's
limit can be surpassed under particular sets of conditions. Quantum information
and quantum metrology have given us new ways to approach measurement ; a new
proposal inspired by these ideas has now re-examined the problem of trying to
estimate the separation between two poorly resolved point sources. The &quot;Fisher
information&quot; provides the inverse of the Cramer-Rao bound, the lowest variance
achievable for an unbiased estimator. For a given imaging system and a fixed
number of collected photons, Tsang, Nair and Lu observed that the Fisher
information carried by the intensity of the light in the image-plane (the only
information available to traditional techniques, including previous
super-resolution approaches) falls to zero as the separation between the
sources decreases; this is known as &quot;Rayleigh's Curse.&quot; On the other hand, when
they calculated the quantum Fisher information of the full electromagnetic
field (including amplitude and phase information), they found it remains
constant. In other words, there is infinitely more information available about
the separation of the sources in the phase of the field than in the intensity
alone. Here we implement a proof-of-principle system which makes use of the
phase information, and demonstrate a greatly improved ability to estimate the
distance between a pair of closely-separated sources, and immunity to
Rayleigh's curse.

simulates, for time $t$ and error $\epsilon$, a time-independent $d$-sparse
Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ on $n$ qubits specified to $m$ bits of precision. The
query complexity $N$ with respect to $\tau=dt\|\hat{H}\|_{\text{max}}$ and
$\epsilon$ is
$\mathcal{O}(\tau+\frac{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}{\log{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}})$ for
$\tau \lesssim \frac{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}{\log{\log{(1/\epsilon)}}}$, and
$\mathcal{O}(\tau+\log{(\frac{1}{\epsilon})})$ for $\tau \gtrsim
\log{(\frac{1}{\epsilon})}$, which achieves known lower bounds additively with
an additional primitive gate complexity
$\mathcal{O}((n+m\;\text{polylog}(m))N)$, and improves on prior art where
suboptimal functions of $\tau, \epsilon$ enter multiplicatively instead of
additively. This is made possible by approaching the simulation problem
differently, using a three-step &quot;quantum signal processing&quot; methodology,
comprised of (1) transducing eigenvalues of $\hat{H}$ into a single ancilla
qubit, (2) coherently transforming these eigenvalues in a highly nonlinear
manner, and (3) projecting this ancilla with near unity success probability.
This computes a large class of unitary functions of $\hat{H}$, of which
Hamiltonian simulation is a special case.

transformation on a given input state, using multiple copies of some unknown
sample input states of the unitary and their corresponding output states. The
algorithm does not assume any prior information about the unitary to be
emulated, or the sample input states. To emulate the action of the unknown
unitary, the new input state is coupled to the given sample input-output pairs
in a coherent fashion. Remarkably, the runtime of the algorithm is logarithmic
in D, the dimension of the Hilbert space, and increases polynomially with d,
the dimension of the subspace spanned by the sample input states. Furthermore,
the sample complexity of the algorithm, i.e. the total number of copies of the
sample input-output pairs needed to run the algorithm, is independent of D, and
polynomial in d. In contrast, the runtime and the sample complexity of
incoherent methods, i.e. methods that use tomography, are both linear in D. The
algorithm is blind, in the sense that at the end it does not learn anything
about the given samples, or the emulated unitary. This algorithm can be used as
a subroutine in other algorithms, such as quantum phase estimation.

bound of steering inequalities in such a post-selected scenario. We then
present a construction of linear steering inequalities in arbitrary finite

as the detection efficiencies are above the known bound below which steering
can never be demonstrated. We also show how our method extends to the scenarios
of multipartite steering and Bell nonlocality, in the general case where there
can be correlations between the losses of the different parties. In both cases
we present examples to demonstrate the techniques developed.

analytically solve the optimization problem in the definition of the
entanglement-based measure for a two-level system. We demonstrate that the

Finally, we explain this disagreement between the two measures in terms of the

  The examples we construct are instances of (binary) linear system games. For

with narrow linewidths. However, the observed linewidths are broader than
lifetime measurements predict, due to spin and charge noise in the environment.
This noise randomly shifts the transition energy and destroys coherence and
indistinguishability of the emitted photons. Fortunately, the fluctuations can
be reduced by a stabilization using a suitable feedback loop. In this work we
demonstrate a fast feedback loop that manifests itself in a strong hysteresis
and bistability of the exciton resonance fluorescence signal. Field ionization
of photogenerated quantum dot excitons leads to the formation of a charged
interface layer that drags the emission line along over a frequency range of
more than 30 GHz. This internal charge-driven feedback loop could be used to
reduce the spectral diffusion and stabilize the emission frequency within

divergence of phase sensitivity, which inevitably reduces the quality of

singularity is a common problem in quantum-enhanced microscopy that uses a
finite $N$ nonclassical state for illumination (e.g., the N00N states and the
twin-Fock states). We propose two schemes to remedy this singularity: (i)
locking the phase shift sensed by the beams at the optimal working point, using
a spatially dependent offset phase, which can be fulfilled by a feedback loop
in the microscopy; (ii) a combination of two binary-outcome coincidence
detections with and without a fixed offset phase also works to completely
eliminate the singularity. Our observations, valid for any kind of
binary-outcome quantum measurement, open the way for realistic implementations

case of the Dirac field in 1+1 dimensional flat spacetime, generalizing a
recently developed formalism for scalar fields. This is achieved exploiting
again the non-uniqueness of quantization process. Instead of elementary
excitations carrying definite amounts of energy and momentum, we construct the
elementary excitations of the field localized (at some instant) in a definite
region of space. This construction not only leads to a natural notion of
localized quanta, but also provides a local algebra of operators. Once
constructed, the new representation is confronted to the standard global (Fock)
construction. In spite of being unitarily inequivalent representations, the
localized operators are well defined in the conventional Fock space. By using
them we dig up the issues of localization in QFT showing how the globality of
the vacuum state is responsible for the lack of a &quot;common sense localization&quot;

of their long coherence times and compatibility with industrial fabrication
techniques. Despite many advances in donor-based qubit technology, it remains
difficult to selectively manipulate single donor electron spins. Here, we show
that by replacing the prevailing semiconductor host material (silicon) with
germanium, donor electron spin qubits can be electrically tuned by more than an
ensemble linewidth, making them compatible with gate addressable quantum
computing architectures. Using pulsed electron spin resonance, we measured the
Stark effect for donor electron spins in germanium. We resolved both spin-orbit
and hyperfine Stark shifts and found that at 0.4 T (X-band microwave
frequencies), the spin-orbit Stark shift dominates. The spin-orbit Stark shift
is highly anisotropic, depending on the electric field orientation relative to
the crystal axes and external magnetic field. When the Stark shift is
maximized, the spin-orbit Stark parameter was found to be four orders of
magnitude larger than in silicon. At select orientations a hyperfine Stark
effect was also resolved and found to be an order of magnitude larger than in
silicon. We report the Stark parameters for $^{75}$As and $^{31}$P donor
electrons and compare them to the available theory. Our data reveal that
$^{31}$P donors in germanium can be tuned by at least four times the ensemble
linewidth making germanium an intriguing new host material for spin qubits that

superradiance, originally predicted for an ensemble of two-level atoms in
entangled states, and the Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect, initially established
in astronomy to determine the dimensions of classical light sources like stars.
By studying the state evolution of the fields produced by classical sources --
defined by a positive Glauber-Sudarshan P function -- when recording intensity
correlations of higher order in a generalized Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup we
find that the angular distribution of the last detected photon, apart from an
offset, is identical to the superradiant emission pattern generated by an
ensemble of two-level atoms in entangled symmetric Dicke states. We show that
the phenomenon derives from projective measurements induced by the measurement
of photons in the far field of the sources and the permutative superposition of
quantum paths identical to those leading to superradiance in the case of single
photon emitters. We thus point out an important similarity between classical
sources and quantum emitters upon detection of photons if the particular photon
source remains unknown. We finally present a compact result for the
characteristic functional which generates intensity correlations of arbitrary

quantum mechanics including the super position of states, the non locality and
its limitation to determine an experiment only statistically. Here, this well
known paradox is revisited theoretically for a pair of spin 1/2 systems in a
singlet state under the assumption that in classical physics time evolves in
discrete time steps Deltat while in quantum mechanics the individual spin
system(s) evolve(s) between the eigenstates harmonically with a period of 4
Deltat. It is further assumed that time is a single variable, that the quantum
mechanics time evolution and the classical physics discrete time evolution are
coherent to each other, and that the precision of the start of the experiment
and of the measurement time point are much less than Deltat. Under these
conditions, it is demonstrated for a spin 1/2 system that the fast oscillation
between the eigen states spin up and spin down reproduces the expected outcome
of a single measurement as well as ensemble measurements without the need of
postulating a simultaneous superposition of the spin system in its quantum
state. When this concept is applied to a spin 1/2 system pair in a singlet
state it is shown that no entanglement between the two spins is necessary to
describe the system resolving the Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox.

individual atoms and photons, more complex platforms composed by several units
can be assembled enabling distinctive forms of dissipation and decoherence, in
independent heat baths or collectively into a common bath, with dramatic
consequences for the preservation of quantum coherence. The cross-over between
these two regimes has been widely attributed in the literature to the system
units being farther apart than the bath's correlation length. Starting from a
microscopic model of a structured environment (a crystal) sensed by two bosonic
probes, here we show the failure of such conceptual relation, and identify the
exact physical mechanism underlying this cross-over, displaying a sharp

collective dissipation becomes possible for very large distances between

that couples to states near the surface. We unexpectedly find coherent
oscillations between the surface and the bulk and trace their appearance to
unavoidable resonances caused by photon absorption from the drive. We show how
these resonant oscillations may be captured by the Demkov- Osherov model of
multi-level Landau-Zener physics, leading to non-trivial consequences such as
the loss of adiabaticity upon slow ramping of the amplitude. We numerically
demonstrate that these oscillations are observable in the time-dependent Wigner

Our results apply generically to any system with surface states in the presence

electromagnetic field ( ZPF ) and with a polarization normal to the rotation
plane, is considered. Temporal periodicity conditions are imposed on ZPF,
associated with the way the rotating oscillator observes ZPF. They are similar
to spatial boundary conditions in Casimir phenomenon and therefore result in
ZPF spectrum change from continuous one to a discrete one and, as a
consequence, an effective temperature of the modified ZPF (Y. S. Levin ). The
average centripetal average force on the oscillator, originating from this
modified ZPF scattered by the oscillator in the near zone, is calculated in
terms of the bilinear correlation functions of electromagnetic field. After
renormalization of the correlation function, which physically means extraction
of a pure effect of periodicity, the force has a finite value. All calculations
are carried out using the methodology of stochastic electrodynamics. The radial
component of the force is directed to the center of rotation. In non
relativistic case and for oscillator frequency smaller than rotation frequency,
the force turns out to be proportional to the rotation radius. Such result
could mean a possibility that micro motion of the oscillator in ZPF sustains
its average circular motion without any other external forces.Though the
estimation done for the point-like electron shows that the effect is not
observable because the radius of such circular electron motion would have been
much smaller than the classical electron radius when our semi classical
approach to the electromagnetic problem does not work. It is well expected
result and considered as the first step in the application of the idea in the
quark world governed by non abelian colored fields, subject of the next paper.

periodically modulated real and complex fields. It is shown that both models
can be mapped on a pseudo spin system in the k space in the aid of an extended
Bogoliubov transformation. This allows us to introduce the geometric quantity,
the Chern number, to identify the nature of quantum phases. Based on the exact

rearrange the phase boundaries from that of the ordinary Ising model, which can
be characterized by the Chern numbers defined in the context of Dirac and

  problems</title><description>  What is the minimum amount of information and time needed to solve 2SAT? When
the instance is known, it can be solved in polynomial time, but is this also
possible without knowing the instance? Bei, Chen and Zhang (STOC '13)
considered a model where the input is accessed by proposing possible
assignments to a special oracle. This oracle, on encountering some constraint
unsatisfied by the proposal, returns only the constraint index. It turns out
that, in this model, even 1SAT cannot be solved in polynomial time unless P=NP.
Hence, we consider a model in which the input is accessed by proposing
probability distributions over assignments to the variables. The oracle then
returns the index of the constraint that is most likely to be violated by this
distribution. We show that the information obtained this way is sufficient to
solve 1SAT in polynomial time, even when the clauses can be repeated. For 2SAT,
as long as there are no repeated clauses, in polynomial time we can even learn
an equivalent formula for the hidden instance and hence also solve it.
Furthermore, we extend these results to the quantum regime. We show that in
this setting 1QSAT can be solved in polynomial time up to constant precision,
and 2QSAT can be learnt in polynomial time up to inverse polynomial precision.

electron orbital angular momentum measurement techniques has lagged behind. We
show that coupling between electron orbital angular momentum and a spatially

We propose a design for an orbital angular momentum measurement device built on

of band crossings in the bulk, which realize Fermi surfaces of reduced
dimensionality. We find that these unavoidable crossings originate from the
momentum dependence of the nonsymmorphic symmetry, which puts strong
restrictions on the global structure of the band configurations. The
symmetry-required band crossings are generically located at high-symmetry
points of the Brillouin zone and their exact positions are determined by the
algebra of the symmetry operators. It is revealed that these band degeneracies
are of a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological nature, as opposed to the local
topological charges of Fermi points in, say, Weyl semimetals. We also discuss

  Heat Transfer, and Force</title><description>  Quantum and thermal fluctuations of electromagnetic waves are the cornerstone
of quantum and statistical physics, and inherent to such phenomena as thermal
radiation and van der Waals forces. While the basic principles are the material
of elementary texts, recent experimental and technological advances have made
it necessary to come to terms with counterintuitive consequences of
electromagnetic fluctuations at short scales -- in the so called {\it
near-field} regime. We focus on three manifestations of such behavior: {\bf
(i)} The Stefan--Boltzmann law describes thermal radiation from macroscopic
bodies, but fails to account for magnitude, polarization and coherence of
radiation from small objects (say compared to the skin depth). {\bf (ii)} The
heat transfer between two bodies at similar close proximity is dominated by
evanescent waves, and can be several orders of magnitude larger than the
classical contribution due to propagating waves. {\bf (iii)} Casimir/van der
Waals interactions are a dominant force between objects at sub-micron
separation; the non-equilibrium analogs of this force (for objects at different
temperatures) have not been sufficiently explored (at least experimentally). To
explore these phenomena we introduce the tool of fluctuational quantum
electrodynamics (QED) originally introduced by Rytov in the 1950s. Combined
with a scattering formalism, this enables studies of heat radiation and
transfer, equilibrium and non-equilibrium forces for objects of different
material properties, shapes, separations and arrangements.

  Classical Contexts and Quantum Reality</title><description>  In this paper we attempt to analyze the physical and philosophical meaning of
quantum contextuality. In the first part we will argue that a general confusion
within the literature comes from the improper &quot;scrambling&quot; of two different
meanings of quantum contextuality. The first one is related to an epistemic
interpretation of contextuality, introduced by Bohr, which stresses the
incompatibility (or complementarity) of quantum measurements. The second, is
related to an ontic notion of contextuality, exposed through the Kochen-Specker
(KS) theorem, which focuses on the constraints to discuss about actual
(definite valued) properties within the orthodox formalism of QM. We will show
how these two notions have been scrambled together creating an &quot;omelette of
contextuality&quot; which has been fully widespread through a popularized &quot;epistemic
explanation&quot; of the KS theorem according to which: The outcome of the
observable A when measured together with B or together with C will necessarily
differ in case [A,B] = [A,C] = 0, and [B,C] =/ 0. We will show why this
statement is not only improperly scrambling epistemic and ontic perspectives,
but is also physically and philosophically meaningless. In the second part of
the paper, we will analyse the relation between 'classical contexts' and QM. We
will show that three accepted presuppositions found within the orthodox
literature are, in general, false. Namely: (i) that quantum contextuality does
not preclude an objective description of physical reality, (ii) that the choice
of a context (or basis) restores a classical description of reality, and (iii)
that the choice of a (classical) context is a necessary condition for
accounting for empirical statements in QM.

and non-contextuality inequalities arising from the no-signaling and
no-disturbance principles is developed using the graph-theoretic method
introduced in \textit{Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 050404 (2012)}. The sufficient
condition for the existence of a monogamy between any two Bell or
non-contextuality inequalities in terms of a decomposition of the commutation
graph representing all the observables in the setup into induced chordal
graphs, is studied. The condition is used to show that any two cycle
inequalities, whether studied as non-contextuality or Bell inequalities and for
any length of the cycle, are monogamous under certain conditions with each
other. As a main application, a novel type of trade-off is then derived, namely
Bell inequalities that do not exhibit monogamy features of their own can be
activated to be monogamous by the addition of a local contextuality term. This
is illustrated by means of the well-known $I_{3322}$ inequality. The
non-necessity of the condition for the existence of a monogamy relation is
shown by means of an explicit counter-example. In the derivation of novel
no-signaling monogamies, we uncover a new feature, namely that two-party Bell
expressions that are trivially classically saturated can become non-trivial
upon the addition of an expression involving a third party with a single
measurement input. This implies that the study of Bell inequalities (and the
corresponding classical polytopes) with single inputs for some of the parties
becomes interesting.

field in the dispersive (far-detuned) regime. The time modulation of the
driving field leads to the parametric amplification of the mechanical vacuum
fluctuations of the MO, which results in the generation of Casimir phonons over
time scales longer than the cavity lifetime. We show that the generated phonons
exhibit quadrature squeezing, bunching effect, and super-Poissonian statistics
which are controllable by the externally modulated laser pump. In particular,
we find that the scheme allows for a perfect squeezing transfer from one
mechanical quadrature to another when the laser frequency is varied from red
detuning to blue detuning. Moreover, by analyzing the effect of the thermal

  Tensor surgery on the triangle graph, which corresponds to the matrix

have provided an exemplary model system to demonstrate the physics of
closed-system phase transitions, confirming many theoretical models and
results. Our understanding of dissipative phase transitions in quantum systems
is less developed, and experiments that probe this physics even less so. By
placing cold atoms in optical cavities, and inducing strong coupling between
light and excitations of the atoms, one can experimentally study phase
transitions of open quantum systems. Here we observe and study a novel form of
nonequilibrium phase transition, the condensation of
supermode-density-wave-polaritons. These polaritons are formed from a hybrid
&quot;supermode&quot; of cavity photons coupled to atomic density waves of a quantum gas.
Because the cavity supports multiple photon spatial modes, and because the
matter-light coupling can be comparable to the energy splitting of these modes,
the composition of the supermode polariton is changed by the matter-light
coupling upon condensation. These results, found in the few-mode-degenerate
cavity regime, demonstrate the potential of fully multimode cavities to exhibit
physics beyond mean-field theories. Such systems will provide experimental
access to nontrivial phase transitions in driven dissipative quantum systems as

so transmon-resonator energy levels hybridize into joint eigenstate ladders of
the Jaynes-Cummings type. Previous work has shown that ringing up the resonator
approximately respects this ladder structure to produce a coherent state in the
eigenbasis (a dressed coherent state). We numerically investigate the validity
of this coherent state approximation to find two primary deviations. First,
resonator ring-up leaks small stray populations into eigenstate ladders
corresponding to different transmon states. Second, within an eigenstate ladder
the transmon nonlinearity shears the coherent state as it evolves. We then show
that the next natural approximation for this sheared state in the eigenbasis is
a dressed squeezed state, and derive simple evolution equations for such states
using a hybrid phase-Fock-space description.

  macroscopic artificial atoms and a superconducting resonator</title><description>  The hybridization of distinct quantum systems is now seen as an effective way
to engineer the properties of an entire system leading to applications in
quantum metamaterials, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology. One well
known example is superconducting circuits coupled to ensembles of microscopic
natural atoms. In such cases, the properties of the individual atom are
intrinsic, and so are unchangeable. However, current technology allows us to
fabricate large ensembles of macroscopic artificial atoms such as
superconducting flux qubits, where we can really tailor and control the
properties of individual qubits. Here, we demonstrate coherent coupling between
a microwave resonator and several thousand superconducting flux qubits, where
we observe a large dispersive frequency shift in the spectrum of 250 MHz
induced by collective behavior. These results represent the largest number of
coupled superconducting qubits realized so far. Our approach shows that it is
now possible to engineer the properties of the ensemble, opening up the way for
the controlled exploration of the quantum many-body system.

  by a finite bandwidth squeezed vacuum excitation</title><description>  In this paper, we theoretically investigate the displacement and momentum
fluctuations spectra of the movable mirror in a standard optomechanical system
driven by a finite bandwidth squeezed vacuum light accompanying a coherent
laser field. Two cases in which the squeezed vacuum is generated by degenerated
and non-degenerate parametric oscillators (DPO and NDPO) are considered. We
find that for the case of finite bandwidth squeezed vacuum injection, the two
spectra exhibit unique features, which strongly differ from those of broadband
squeezing excitation. In particular, the spectra exhibit a three-peaked and a
four-peaked structure, respectively, for the squeezing injection from DPO and
NDPO. Besides, some anomalous characteristics of the spectra such as
squeezing-induced pimple, hole burning, and dispersive profile are found to be
highly sensitive to the squeezing parameters and the temperature of the mirror.
We also evaluate the mean-square fluctuations in position and momentum
quadratures of the movable mirror and analyze the influence of the squeezing
parameters of the input field on the mechanical squeezing. It will be shown
that the parameters of driven squeezed vacuum affects the squeezing. We find
the optimal mechanical squeezing is achievable via finite bandwidth squeezed
vacuum injection which is affected by the intensity of squeezed vacuum. We also
show that the phase of incident squeezed vacuum determines whether position or
momentum squeezing occurs. Our proposed scheme not only provides a feasible
experimental method to detect and characterize squeezed light by optomechanical
systems, but also suggests a way for controllable transfer of squeezing from an
optical field to a mechanical oscillator.

formed by static and radio frequency (rf) fields has been studied using the
Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique. Using the simulations, a case
of formation of a toroidal trap for cold $^{87}Rb$ atoms is investigated for
atoms trapped in a static quadrupole magnetic trap and exposed to an rf-field
with temporally increasing amplitude and decreasing frequency. We first
calculate the adiabatic rf-dressed potential for an atom interacting with these
fields and then apply DSMC algorithm to simulate the motion of the atom in this
time dependent adiabatic potential. In the simulations the Landau-Zener (LZ)
transition probability is calculated to know if the atom is in the trappable or
untrappable dressed state. The results show that, initially at lower rf-field
strength, the rf-field ejects atoms from the trap and leads to evaporative
cooling of the atom cloud. However at higher rf-field strength, the atoms make
LZ transition to the trappable dressed state which results in a toroidal shape
to the atom cloud. The results of numerical simulations show a qualitative
agreement with the experimental observations.

  Hilbert-Schmidt decompositions</title><description>  Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) decompositions are employed for analyzing systems of
n-qubits, and a qubit with a qudit. Negative eigenvalues, obtained by
partial-transpose (PT) plus local unitary transformations (PTU) for one qubit
from the whole system, are used for indicating inseparability. A sufficient
criterion for full separability of the n-qubits and qubit-qudit systems is
given. We use the singular value decomposition (SVD) for improving the
criterion for full separability. General properties of entanglement and
separability are analyzed for a system of a qubit and a qudit and n-qubits
systems, with emphasis on maximally disordered subsystems (MDS) (i.e., density
matrices rho(MDS) for which tracing over any subsystem gives the unit density
matrix). A sufficient condition that rho(MDS) is not separable is that it has
an eigenvalue larger than 1/d for a qubit and a qudit, and larger than
1/2^(n-1) for n-qubits system. The PTU transformation does not change the
eigenvalues of the n-qubits MDS density matrices for odd n. Thus the
Peres-Horodecki criterion does not give any information about entanglement of
these density matrices, but this criterion is useful for indicating
inseparability for even n. The changes of the entanglement and separability
properties of the GHZ state, the Braid entangled state and the W state by
mixing them with white noise are analyzed by the use of the present methods.
The entanglement and separability properties of the GHZ-diagonal density
matrices, composed of mixture of 8 GHZ density matrices with probabilities
p(i), is analyzed as function of these probabilities. In some cases we show
that the Peres-Horodecki criterion is both sufficient and necessary.

exponentially in the number of qubits consisted in the ancilla. Although the
probability can be amplified through the amplitude amplification process, the
input dependence of the amplitude amplification makes difficult to sequentially
combine two or more ancilla based circuits. A new version of the amplitude
amplification known as the oblivious amplitude amplification runs independently
of the input to the system register. This allow us to to sequentially combine
two or more ancilla based circuits. However, this type of the amplification
only works when the considered system is unitary or non-unitary but somehow
close to a unitary.
  In this paper, we present a general framework to simulate non-unitary
matrices on ancilla based quantum circuits in which the success probability is
maximized by using the oblivious amplitude amplification. In particular, we
show how to extend a non-unitary matrix to an almost unitary matrix. We then
simulate the extended matrix by using an ancilla based circuit design along
with the oblivious amplitude amplification. Measuring the distance of the
produced matrix to the closest unitary unitary matrix, a lower bound for the
fidelity of the final state obtained from the oblivious amplitude amplification
process is presented. Numerical simulations for random matrices of different
sizes show that independent of the system size, the final amplified
probabilities are generally around 0.75 and the fidelity of the final state is
mostly high and around 0.95. Furthermore, we discuss the complexity analysis
and show that combining two such ancilla based circuits, a matrix product can
be implemented. This may lead us to efficiently implement matrix functions
represented as infinite matrix products on quantum computers.

increasing the probability of a particular outcome of a measurement on one

  scattering resonances</title><description>  Anisotropy is a fundamental property of particle interactions. It occupies a
central role in cold and ultra-cold molecular processes, where long range
forces have been found to significantly depend on orientation in ultra-cold
polar molecule collisions. Recent experiments have demonstrated the emergence
of quantum phenomena such as scattering resonances in the cold collisions
regime due to quantization of the intermolecular degrees of freedom. Although
these states have been shown to be sensitive to interaction details, the effect
of anisotropy on quantum resonances has eluded experimental observation so far.
Here, we directly measure the anisotropy in atom-molecule interactions via
quantum resonances by changing the quantum state of the internal molecular
rotor. We observe that a quantum scattering resonance at a collision energy of
$k_B$ x 270 mK appears in the Penning ionization of molecular hydrogen with
metastable helium only if the molecule is rotationally excited. We use state of
the art ab initio and multichannel quantum molecular dynamics calculations to
show that the anisotropy contributes to the effective interaction only for
$H_2$ molecules in the first excited rotational state, whereas rotationally
ground state $H_2$ interacts purely isotropically with metastable helium.
Control over the quantum state of the internal molecular rotation allows us to
switch the anisotropy on or off and thus disentangle the isotropic and
anisotropic parts of the interaction. These quantum phenomena provide a
challenging benchmark for even the most advanced theoretical descriptions,
highlighting the advantage of using cold collisions to advance the microscopic
understanding of particle interactions.

the photoelectron angular distribution with respect to the propagation axis of
circularly polarized light. It has recently been demonstrated in femtosecond
multi-photon photoionization experiments with randomly oriented camphor and
fenchone molecules [C. Lux et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 51, 5001 (2012);C. S.
Lehmann et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234307 (2013)]. A theoretical framework
describing this process as (2+1) resonantly enhanced multi-photon ionization is
constructed, which consists of two-photon photoselection from randomly oriented
molecules and successive one-photon ionisation of the photoselected molecules.
It combines perturbation theory for the light-matter interaction with ab initio
calculations for the two-photon absorption and a single-center expansion of the
photoelectron wavefunction in terms of hydrogenic continuum functions. It is
verified that the model correctly reproduces the basic symmetry behavior
expected under exchange of handedness and light helicity. When applied it to
fenchone and camphor, semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental data is
found, for which a sufficient d wave character of the electronically excited
intermediate state is crucial.

interferometric homodyne measurements of light on an array of light-matter
interfaces followed by local feedback acting on each material system
individually. While the systems are physically non-interacting, the feedback
master equation we derive describes driven-dissipative, interacting many-body

derive necessary conditions on models supporting non-trivial quantum dynamics
beyond what can be generated by local operations and classical communication.
We provide specific examples of models which allow for the creation of

investigate this property by computing the entanglement entropy, via the
replica trick, in states dual to superpositions of macroscopically distinct
geometries and find it consistent with evaluating the expectation value of the
area operator within such states. However, we find that this fails once the
number of semi-classical states in the superposition grows exponentially in the
central charge of the CFT. Moreover, in certain such scenarios we find that the
choice of surface on which to evaluate the area operator depends on the density
matrix of the entire CFT. This nonlinearity is enforced in the bulk via the
homology prescription of Ryu-Takayanagi. We thus conclude that the homology
constraint is not a linear property in the CFT. We also discuss the existence
of entropy operators in general systems with a large number of degrees of

double-slit experiment dates back to the inception of quantum mechanics (QM)
and to the famous Einstein-Bohr debates. In this paper we propose and discuss
an experiment able to spy on one photon's path with another photon. We modify
the quantum state inside the interferometer as opposed to the traditional
physical modification of the &quot;wave-like&quot; or &quot;particle-like&quot; experimental setup.
We are able to show that it is the ability to harvest or not which-path
information that finally limits the visibility of the interference pattern and
not the &quot;wave-like&quot; or &quot;particle-like&quot; experimental setups. Remarkably, a full
&quot;particle-like&quot; experimental setup is able to show interference fringes with
100 % visibility if the quantum state is carefully engineered.

interference when waves and particles travel simultaneously along two different
spatial paths. Here, we propose a double-slit experiment in momentum space. We
show that elastic scattering of vortex electrons proceeds via two paths in
momentum space, which are well localized and well separated from each other.
For such vortex beams, the (plane-wave) amplitudes along the two paths acquire
adjustable phase shifts and produce interference fringes in the final angular
distribution. We argue that this experiment can be realized with the present
day technology. We show that it gives experimental access to the Coulomb phase,
a quantity which plays an important role in all charged particle scattering but
which usual scattering experiments are insensitive to.

  transverse and longitudinal couplings</title><description>  Microwave resonators have been used to realize qubit readout, two-qubit
gates, and state shuttling between distant quantum systems. Strong coupling
between a spin qubit and a resonator may be achieved using an inhomogeneous
magnetic field generated with a nanomagnet. We consider a spin qubit in a
double quantum dot exposed to a stray magnetic field with transverse and
longitudinal components with respect to an applied external field. We show that
this geometry leads to transverse and longitudinal couplings of ~1 MHz between
the spin qubit and the resonator. Using realistic simulations of a GaAs device,
we show how precise placement of the nanomagnet allows to select between
transverse and longitudinal coupling. We also explain how to mitigate new
dephasing and relaxation channels that are inherent to this coupling scheme.
This analysis gives a clear route towards realization of coherent state
transfer between a microwave resonator and a single spin in quantum dots with a
fidelity above 90%. Improved dynamical decoupling sequences, low-noise
environments, and longer-lived microwave cavities may lead to substantially
higher fidelities in the near future.

However, while the origin of time for non-conservative systems can be traced
back to the environmental influence, this procedure is inapplicable for the
closed (conservative) quantum systems. Hence the question of the origin of time
for closed systems. In addressing this issue, in order to avoid circularity of
the standard universal (global) time as well as assumptions that could be
additional to the standard postulates of quantum theory, we stick to the
so-called quantum-mechanical local time. The problems that inevitably appear in
such minimalist rejection of the standard role of time in physics are solved

large quadrupole moment of a neutral molecule, which is lacking a permanent
dipole moment. The nature of the bound states and low-lying resonances of such
anions is of interest for understanding the threshold behavior of open quantum
systems in general. In this work, we investigate the properties of quadrupolar
anions as extreme halo systems, the formation of rotational bands, and the
transition from a subcritical to supercritical electric quadrupole moment. We
solve the electron-plus-molecule problem using a non-adiabatic coupled-channel
formalism by employing the Berggren ensemble, which explicitly contains bound
states, narrow resonances, and the scattering continuum. We demonstrate that
binding energies and radii of quadrupolar anions strictly follow the scaling
laws for two-body halo systems. Contrary to the case of dipolar anions,
ground-state band of quadrupolar anions smoothly extend into the continuum, and
many rotational bands could be identified above the detachment threshold. We
study the evolution of a bound state of an anion as to dives into the continuum
at a critical quadrupole moment and we show that the associated critical
exponent is consistent with the second-order phase transition. Everything
considered, quadrupolar anions represent a perfect laboratory for the studies
of marginally bound open quantum systems.

their role in applica- tions in quantum information science, where the active
use of phonons is currently highly debated. A genuine quantum phenomenon
associated with the fluctuation properties of phonons is squeezing, which is
achieved when the fluctuations of a certain variable drop below their
respective vacuum value. We consider a semiconductor quantum dot in which the
exciton is coupled to phonons. We review the fluctuation properties of the
phonons, which are generated by optical manipulation of the quantum dot, in the
limiting case of ultra short pulses. Then we discuss the phonon properties for
an excitation with finite pulses. Within a generating function formalism we
calculate the corre- sponding fluctuation properties of the phonons and show
that phonon squeezing can be achieved by the optical manipulation of the
quantum dot exciton for certain conditions even for a single pulse excitation
where neither for short nor for long pulses squeezing occurs. To explain the
occurrence of squeezing we employ a Wigner function picture providing a

  PT-threshold and the fate of localization</title><description>  Open, non-equilibrium systems with balanced gain and loss, known as
parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetric systems, exhibit properties that are
absent in closed, isolated systems. A key property is the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition, which occurs when the gain-loss
strength, a measure of the openness of the system, exceeds the intrinsic
energy-scale of the system. We analyze the fate of this transition in
disordered lattices with non-Hermitian gain and loss potentials $\pm i\gamma$
at reflection-symmetric sites. Contrary to the popular belief, we show that the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric phase is protected in the presence of a correlated
(periodic) disorder which leads to a positive $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking
threshold. We uncover a veiled symmetry of such disordered systems that is
instrumental for the said protection, and show that this symmetry leads to new
localization behavior across the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking transition.
We elucidate the interplay between such localization and the
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking phenomena in disordered
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric lattices, and support our conclusions with a
beam-propagation-method analysis. Our theoretical predictions provide avenues
for experimental realizations of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems with
engineered disorder.

We prove this using the theory of C*-algebras and we also provide an explicit

activity of surroundings will not change the single atom behaviors while it can
change the collective behaviors of the two dipoles, as well as greatly affect
the dipole-dipole resonance interaction. Especially, if the orientations of two
dipoles are orthogonal and respectively perpendicular to the interdipole axis,
the interdipole resonance interaction can be established with the help of
optically active surroundings while there is no resonance interaction in
vacuum.

and quantum information processing devices has become a topic of intense study
in the past two decades. While many results are known for physical systems that
can be described using pure states, much less is known for the more general
mixed state scenarios. The deterministic quantum computing with one qubit
(DQC1) model is a non-universal model for quantum computing. The highly mixed
nature of the states in this model make it a popular tool for studying the role
of entanglement and correlations in mixed state quantum computing. In the past,
the amounts of entanglement and/or discord produced in a particular instance of
DQC1 were studied for special cases and typical instances. Here we present more
tools for studying entanglement in this model. These tools provide us with new
insights about the role of entanglement in DQC1. We show that results regarding
typical instances are poor indicators of the role of entanglement generated in
DQC1 complete problems. We further give a necessary and sufficient condition on
the purity of the initial states that can produce entanglement in DQC1. The
tools presented in this work may be useful for identifying (or ruling out) a
subset of DQC1 circuits that can encode DQC1 complete problems without
producing entanglement. They are also useful for studying other quantum systems
where the states have a highly degenerate eigenvalue spectrum.

  spin</title><description>  The role of the generalized Pauli constraints (GPCs) in higher spatial
dimensions and by incorporating spin degrees of freedom is systematically
explored for a system of interacting fermions confined by a harmonic trap.
Physical relevance of the GPCs is confirmed by analytical means for the ground
state in the regime of weak couplings by finding its vector of natural
occupation numbers close to the boundary of the allowed region. Such
quasipinning is found to become weaker in the intermediate and strong coupling
regime. The study of crossovers between different spatial dimensions by
detuning the harmonic trap frequencies suggests that quasipinning is
essentially an effect for systems with reduced spatial dimensionality. In
addition, we find that quasipinning becomes stronger by increasing the degree
of spin-polarization. Consequently, the number of states available around the
Fermi level plays a key role for the occurrence of quasipinning. This suggests
that quasipinning emerges from the conflict between energy minimization and
fermionic exchange symmetry.

the chiral symmetry is restored almost everywhere, and the meson BCS liquid

field, the whole system can enter into the collective strong coupling regime in
which hybrid light-matter states, i.e., polaritons can be created. Only a small
portion of excitations in the emitters are coupled to the light field, and
there are many dark states that, in principle, retain their pure excitonic

delocalized character, which is inherent to polaritons, despite the fact that
they do not have a photonic component. This unexpected behavior only appears
when the electromagnetic field displays a discrete spectrum. In this case, when
the main loss mechanism in the hybrid system stems from the radiative losses of
the light field, dark states are even more efficient than polaritons in
transferring excitations across the structure.

constantly debated in the field of quantum thermodynamics. One natural approach
is to measure the average increase in energy of an ancillary system, called the
battery, after a work extraction protocol. The quality of energy extracted is
usually argued to be good by quantifying higher moments of the energy
distribution, or by restricting the amount of entropy to be low. This limits
the amount of heat contribution to the energy extracted, but does not
completely prevent it. We show that the definition of &quot;work&quot; is crucial. If one

increase in the battery, then a small scale heat engine can possibly exceed the
Carnot efficiency. This can be achieved even when one of the heat baths is

measurements that are inherently incompatible, in the sense that their outcomes
cannot be predicted simultaneously. In contrast, no such uncertainty exists in
the classical domain, where all uncertainty results from ignorance about the
exact state of the physical system. Here, we critically examine the concept of
preparation uncertainty and ask whether similarly in the quantum regime, some
of the uncertainty that we observe can actually also be understood as a lack of

affirmatively by showing that for the well known measurements employed in BB84
quantum key distribution (QKD), the amount of uncertainty can indeed be related
to the amount of available information about additional registers determining
the choice of the measurement. We proceed to show that also for other
measurements the amount of uncertainty is in part connected to a lack of

to the security of cryptographic protocols that make use of BB84 states.

quantum information processing platform. A qubit encoded in the hyperfine
manifold of $^{87}$Rb atom is dynamically extracted from the static quantum
register by an auxiliary moving ODT and reinserted into the static ODT.
Previous experiments were limited by decoherences induced by the differential
light shifts of qubit states. Here we apply a magic-intensity trapping
technique which mitigates the detrimental effects of light shifts and
substantially enhances the coherence time to $225 \pm 21\,\mathrm{ms}$. The
experimentally demonstrated magic trapping technique relies on the previously
neglected hyperpolarizability contribution to the light shifts, which makes the
light shift dependence on the trapping laser intensity to be parabolic. Because
of the parabolic dependence, at a certain &quot;magic&quot; intensity, the first order
sensitivity to trapping light intensity variations over ODT volume is
eliminated. We experimentally demonstrate the utility of this approach and
measure hyperpolarizability for the first time. Our results pave the way for
constructing a scalable quantum-computing architectures with single atoms
trapped in an array of magic ODTs.

for ground states of local Hamiltonians. Recently, [Ambainis, CCC 2014] defined
the complexity class P^QMA[log], and motivated its study by showing that the
physical task of estimating the expectation value of a local observable against
the ground state of a local Hamiltonian is P^QMA[log]-complete. In this paper,
we continue the study of P^QMA[log], obtaining the following results: (1) The
P^QMA[log]-completeness result of [Ambainis, CCC 2014] above requires
O(log(n))-local Hamiltonians and O(log(n))-local observables. Whether this
could be improved to the more physically appealing O(1)-local setting was left
as an open question. We resolve this question positively by showing that
simulating even a single qubit measurement on ground states of 5-local
Hamiltonians is P^QMA[log]-complete. (2) We formalize the complexity theoretic
study of estimating two-point correlation functions against ground states, and
show that this task is P^QMA[log]-complete. (3) P^QMA[log] is thought of as
&quot;slightly harder&quot; than QMA. We give a formal justification of this intuition by
exploiting the technique of hierarchical voting of [Beigel, Hemachandra, and
Wechsung, SCT 1989] to show P^QMA[log] is in PP. This improves the known
containment that QMA is in PP [Kitaev, Watrous, STOC 2000]. (4) A central theme
of this work is the subtlety involved in the study of oracle classes in which
the oracle solves a promise problem. In this vein, we identify a flaw in
[Ambainis, CCC 2014] regarding a P^UQMA[log]-hardness proof for estimating
spectral gaps of local Hamiltonians. By introducing a &quot;query validation&quot;
technique, we build on [Ambainis, CCC 2014] to obtain P^UQMA[log]-hardness for
estimating spectral gaps under polynomial-time Turing reductions.

Following the formal analogy between QED and the description of low-energy

used to compute electron-hole pair creation driven by a circularly or linearly

preparation near the adiabatic limit, extending earlier ideas from [D. A. Sivak
and G. E. Crooks, Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 190602 (2012)] to quantum
non-dissipative systems. The space of controllable parameters of isolated
quantum many-body systems is endowed with a Riemannian quantum metric
structure, which can be exploited when such systems are driven adiabatically.
Here, we use this metric structure to construct optimal protocols in order to
accomplish the task of adiabatic ground-state preparation in a fixed amount of
time. Such optimal protocols are shown to be geodesics on the parameter
manifold, maximizing the local fidelity. Physically, such protocols minimize
the average energy fluctuations along the path. Our findings are illustrated on
the Landau-Zener model and the anisotropic XY spin chain. In both cases we show
that geodesic protocols drastically improve the final fidelity. Moreover, this
happens even if one crosses a critical point, where the adiabatic perturbation

the spirit of the tailored CC method [T. Kinoshita, O. Hino, and R. J.
Bartlett, \textit{J. Chem. Phys.} {\bf 123} (2005) 074106]. In the first step,
the configuration interaction (CI) coefficients corresponding to single and
double excitations within the DMRG active space are computed by contraction of
the matrix product state (MPS) matrices. These coefficients are subsequently
transformed into CC amplitudes. In the second step, the CC amplitudes are used
to define a &quot;tailored&quot; single reference CCSD wavefunction. As a result, the
DMRG method is responsible for the proper description of non-dynamic
correlation, whereas the dynamic correlation is incorporated through the
framework of the CC theory. We illustrate the potential of this method on

high degree of symmetry is required between the two arms of the interferometer.
Assuming that the splitting and recombination processes are adiabatic, we
theoretically derive the phase-shift and the contrast of such an interferometer

excited by narrowband cw laser radiation requires usage of a Stark-switching
technique in order to excite the atoms first in a fixed electric field and then
to induce the interactions in a varied electric field, which is scanned across
the F\&quot;orster resonance. In our experiments with a few cold Rb Rydberg atoms we
have found that the transients at the edges of the electric pulses strongly
affect the line shapes of the F\&quot;orster resonances, since the resonances occur
mainly on a time scale of ~100 ns, which is comparable with the duration of the
transients. For example, a short-term ringing at a certain frequency causes
additional radio-frequency-assisted F\&quot;orster resonances, while non-sharp edges
lead to asymmetry. The intentional application of the radio-frequency field
induces transitions between collective states, whose line shape depends on the
interaction strengths and time. Spatial averaging over the atom positions in a
single interaction volume yields a cusped line shape of the F\&quot;orster
resonance. We present a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of the

incompatible observables measured on a particle. The uncertainty lower bound
can be reduced by considering a particle as a quantum memory entangled with the
measured particle. In this paper, we consider a tripartite scenario in which a
quantum state has been shared between Alice, Bob, and Charlie. The aim of Bob
and Charlie is to minimize Charlie's lower bound about Alice's measurement
outcomes. To this aim, they concentrate their correlation with Alice in
Charlie's side via a cooperative strategy based on local operations and

Alice's measurement outcomes after concentrating information and compare it
with the lower bound without concentrating information in some examples. We

&quot;trajectories&quot; in interference regions in a two-slit interferometer. These
results call for a theoretical re-appraisal of the notion of a &quot;quantum
trajectory&quot; first introduced by Dirac and in the present paper we re-examine
this notion from the Bohm perspective based on Hamiltonian flows. In
particular, we examine the short-time propagator and the role that the quantum
potential plays in determining the form of these trajectories. These
trajectories differ from those produced in a typical particle tracker and the
key to this difference lies in the active suppression of the quantum potential
necessary to produce Mott-type trajectories. We show, using a rigorous
mathematical argument, how the active suppression of this potential arises.
Finally we discuss in detail how this suppression also accounts for the quantum
Zeno effect.

first part of the Chapter, we review the building blocks of the
quantum-mechanical version of the standard random walk in one dimension. The
most distinctive difference between random and quantum walks is the replacement
of the random coin in the former by the action of a unitary operator upon some
internal property of the later. We provide explicit expressions for the
solution to the problem when the most general form for the homogeneous unitary
operator is considered, and we analyze several key features of the system as
the presence of symmetries or stationary limits. After that, we analyze the
consequences of letting the properties of the coin operator change from site to
site, and from time step to time step. In spite of this lack of homogeneity,
the probabilistic properties of the motion of the walker can remain unaltered
if the coin variability is chosen adequately. Finally, we show how this
invariance can be connected to the gauge freedom of electromagnetism.

computational hardness of contracting projected entangled pair states in two

emitters in the weak excitation regime. Under these conditions it is expected
that photons are coherently scattered, and so benefit from a substantial
suppression of detrimental interactions between the source and its phonon
environment. Nevertheless, we demonstrate here that this reasoning is
incomplete, and phonon interactions continue to play a crucial role in
determining solid-state emission characteristics even for very weak excitation.
We find that the sideband resulting from non-Markovian relaxation of the phonon

scattered light and to the visibility of two-photon coalescence at weak
driving, both of which are absent for atomic systems or within simpler
Markovian treatments.

  via an auxiliary qubit induced quadratic mechanical nonlinearity</title><description>  We present a scheme for obtaining steady-state optomechanical entanglement in
an optomechanical system, in which the mechanical mirror is perturabatively
coupled to an auxiliary qubit. The coupling between the mechanical oscillator
and the single qubit results in a quadratic mechanical nonlinear term in the
Hamiltonian describing the system. We find that the mechanical nonlinearity not
only enhances the degree of optomechanical entanglement but also generate it at
a considerably lower optomechanical coupling strength. We observe that the
degree of entanglement decreases monotonically with increasing temperature.
However, the maximum temperature up to which entanglement persists increase
with increasing nonlinear amplitude. Thus, the bipartite entanglement in
presence of the mechanical nonlinearity becomes more robust against thermal
phonon fluctuations.

  Uniformity in the planck constant</title><description>  In this paper the Hartree equation is derived from the N-body Schr{\&quot;o}dinger
equation uniformly in the Planck constant in two different cases, specifically
(a) for T{\&quot;o}plitz initial data and Lipschitz interaction force, and (b) for
analytic initial data and interaction potential, and over short time intervals,
independent of the Planck constant. The convergence rates in these two cases
are 1/ log log N and 1/N respectively. The treatment of the second case is
entirely self-contained and all the constants appearing in the final estimate
are explicit. Moreover it provides a derivation of the Vlasov equation out of
the N-body classical dynamics using hierarchies and not empirical measures.

uniform transverse field on the Bethe lattice, focusing on the quantum phase
transition from a paramagnetic to a glassy phase that is induced by reducing
the intensity of the transverse field. We use a combination of quantum Monte
Carlo algorithms and exact diagonalization to compute R\'enyi entropies,
quantum Fisher information, correlation functions and order parameter. We
locate the transition by means of the peak of the R\'enyi entropy and we find
agreement with the transition point estimated from the emergence of finite
values of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and from the peak of the
correlation length. We interpret the results by means of a mean-field theory in
which quantum fluctuations are treated as massive particles hopping on the
interaction graph. We see that the particles are delocalized at the transition,
a fact that points towards the existence of possibly another transition deep in
the glassy phase where these particles localize, therefore leading to a
many-body localized phase.

  verification</title><description>  Verifiable blind quantum computing is a secure delegated quantum computing
where a client with a limited quantum technology delegates her quantum
computing to a server who has a universal quantum computer. The client's
privacy is protected (blindness) and the correctness of the computation is
verifiable by the client in spite of her limited quantum technology
(verifiability). There are mainly two types of protocols for verifiable blind
quantum computing: the protocol where the client has only to generate
single-qubit states, and the protocol where the client needs only the ability
of single-qubit measurements. The latter is called the measurement-only
verifiable blind quantum computing. If the input of the client's quantum
computing is a quantum state whose classical efficient description is not known
to the client, there was no way for the measurement-only client to verify the
correctness of the input. Here we introduce a new protocol of measurement-only
verifiable blind quantum computing where the correctness of the quantum input
is also verifiable.

an ideal single-qubit controller, to that of continuous measurement-based
feedback for the task of controlling the state of a single qubit. Here the
basic dynamical resource is the ability to couple the system to a
traveling-wave field (for example, a transmission line) via a system
observable, and the fundamental limitation is the maximum rate that is
available for this coupling. We focus on the question of the best achievable
control given ideal controllers. To obtain a fair comparison we acknowledge
that the amplification involved in measurement-based control allows the
controller to use macroscopic fields to apply feedback forces to the system, so
it is natural to allow these feedback forces to be much larger than the
mesoscopic coupling to the transmission line that mediates both the measurement
for measurement-based control and the coupling to the mesoscopic controller for
coherent control. Interestingly our numerical results indicate that under the
above platform for comparison, coherent feedback is able to exactly match the
performance of measurement-based feedback given ideal controllers. We also
discuss various properties of, and control mechanisms for, coherent feedback
networks.

Physics and Computation (PC 2016). The workshop was held on the 14th of July
2016 in Manchester, UK, as a satellite workshop to UCNC 2016, the 15th
International Conference on Unconventional Computation and Natural Computation.
  The goal of the workshop series is to bring together researches working on
the interaction between physics and the theory of computation. This
intrinsically interdisciplinary domain of research strives to go beyond the
traditional use of mathematics as a tool to model and understand the behaviour
of physical systems. Instead, it looks to the the theory of computation and
information to provide new insights into physical systems and processes, and,
in turn, how these insights can lead to new methods, models and notation of
computation and new approaches to computational and mathematical problems.
Topics falling into this category at the interface of physics and computation
that are within the scope of the conference include, amongst many others, the
axiomatisation of physics, hypercomputation, the role of information in
physical systems, quantum information, randomness in physics, theories of
measurement, and the philosophy of physics and computation.

  non-interacting identical particles</title><description>  For a number of non-interacting identical particles entering a multi-channel
scatterer in various wave packet states, we construct a generating function for
the probabilities of various scattering outcomes. This is used to evaluate the
mean numbers of particles $\overline{n}_m$ scattered into a given ($m$-th)
channel, single-channel statistics, and inter-channel correlations. We show
that for initially uncorrelated particles, indistinguishability changes single
channel statistics without altering the the value of $\overline{n}_m$. For
uncorrelated bosons and fermions, bunching and anti-bunching behaviour can be
detected in the extreme-case probabilities, to have all particles scattered
into the same channel, or none of particles scattered into a channel, or
channels. As an example, we consider a cavity with a single long-lived
resonance accessible to the particles, which allows them to &quot;pile up&quot; inside
the scatterer.

combinations of visible and near-infrared (NIR) optical excitation.
Non-monotonic variations in the equilibrium charge state as a function of
optical power are attributed to competing multiphoton ionization and
recombination processes. In certain regimes, multicolor illumination enhances
the steady-state population of the NV's negative charge state above 90%. At
higher NIR intensities, orbital-selective ionization of the singlet manifold
facilitates a protocol for spin-to-charge conversion that dramatically enhances
the spin readout efficiency. We demonstrate a 16-fold increase in the

high-fidelity, single-shot readout of NV spins at room temperature.

entanglement classification, and develop the case of the symmetric subspace. We
show that the class of symmetric separable states has the structure of a
Veronese variety and that its $k$-secant varieties are SLOCC invariants. This
provides an entanglement classification of SLOCC classes into families, showing
relevant properties such as a linear growth of the number of families with the
number of particles. This correspondence also attaches mathematical and
physical meaning to the classification in families, by means of a parent
Hamiltonian construction. Additionally, we show that the states $W_N$ and
GHZ$_N$ are in the same family and that, effectively, the former can be
obtained in a limit from the latter. This paves the way to further use
projective varieties in algebraic geometry to solve open problems in
entanglement theory.

region immersed in a bright thermal bath with the aim of detecting the presence
of a possible low-reflective object. If the signal is entangled with the
receiver, then a suitable choice of the measurement offers a gain with respect
to the optimal classical protocol employing coherent states. Here, we consider
local strategies in which the receiver measures independently the single copies
of the entangled signal. Regarding the quantum estimation of the reflectivity
parameter, we show that the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio with
respect the classical case is limited to 3 dB. We relate these results to the
object detection problem, showing that the gain in the error probability
exponent for strategies based on the estimation of the reflectivity parameter
is ruled by the quantum Fisher information. Finally, we discuss two
paradigmatic examples with Gaussian and Schrodinger's cat states.

in the bulk. In this work however, we show that signatures of a topological
quantum critical point do remain in local observables in the bulk, and manifest
themselves as non-analyticities in their expectation values taken over a family
of non-equilibrium states generated using a quantum quench protocol. The
signature can be used for precisely locating the critical points in parameter
space. A large class of initial states can be chosen for the quench (including
finite temperature states), the sufficient condition being existence of a
finite occupation-gradient with respect to energy for the single-particle
critical mode. We demonstrate these results in tractable models of
non-interacting fermions exhibiting topological phase transitions in one and
two spatial dimensions. We also show that the non-analyticities can be absent
if the gap-closing is non-topological, i.e., when it corresponds to no phase

three-dimensional entangled states can be fast prepared with quite high
fidelities and the two schemes are both robust against the variations in the
parameters, atomic spontaneous emissions and the cavity-fiber photon leakages.

certain elements of quantum mechanics that we may wish to capture, such as
phase, dynamics of unitary transformations, and measurement probabilities.
Traditional quantum logics which focus primarily on the abstract orthomodular
lattice theory and structures of Hilbert spaces have not satisfactorily
captured some of these elements. We can start from 'scratch' in an attempt to
conceptually characterize the types of proof rules which should be in a system
that represents elements necessary for quantum algorithms. This present work
attempts to do this from the perspective of the quantum circuit model of
quantum computation. A sequent calculus based on single quantum circuits is
suggested, and its ability to incorporate important conceptual and dynamic
aspects of quantum computing is discussed. In particular, preserving the
representation of phase helps illustrate the role of interference as a resource
in quantum computation. Interference also provides an intuitive basis for a
non-monotonic calculus.

Is it an object that encodes an
exponentially growing amount of information (in the size of the system) or more
akin to a probability distribution? It turns out that these questions are
sensitive to what we do with the information. For example, Holevo's bound tells
us that n qubits only encode n bits of classical information but for certain
communication complexity tasks there is an exponential separation between
quantum and classical resources. Instead of just contrasting quantum and
classical physics, we can place both within a broad landscape of physical
theories and ask how non-quantum (and non-classical) theories are different
from, or more powerful than quantum theory. For example, in communication
complexity, certain (non-quantum) theories can trivialise all communication
complexity tasks. In recent work [C. M. Lee and M. J. Hoban, Proc. Royal Soc. A
472 (2190), 2016], we showed that the immense power of the information content
of states in general (non-quantum) physical theories is not limited to
communication complexity. We showed that, in general physical theories, states
can be taken as &quot;advice&quot; for computers in these theories and this advice allows
the computers to easily solve any decision problem. Aaronson has highlighted
the close connection between quantum communication complexity and quantum
computations that take quantum advice, and our work gives further indications
that this is a very general connection. In this work, we review the results in
our previous work and discuss the intricate relationship between communication
complexity and computers taking advice for general theories.

face the probability problem: how to justify the norm-squared (Born) rule from
the wavefunction alone. While any basis-independent measure can only be
norm-squared (due to the Gleason-Busch Theorem) this fact conflicts with
various popular, non-wavefunction-based phenomenological measures - such as
observer, outcome or world counting - that are frequently demanded of
Everettians. These alternatives conflict, however, with the wavefunction
realism upon which Everett's approach rests, which seems to call for an
objective, basis-independent measure based only on wavefunction amplitudes. The
ability of quantum probabilities to destructively interfere with each other,
however, makes it difficult to see how probabilities can be derived solely from
amplitudes in an intuitively appealing way. I argue that the use of algorithmic
probability can solve this problem, since the objective, single-case
probability measure that wavefunction realism demands is exactly what
algorithmic information theory was designed to provide. The result is an
intuitive account of complex-valued amplitudes, as coefficients in an optimal
lossy data compression, such that changes in algorithmic information content
(entropy deltas) are associated with phenomenal transitions.

its feasibility has been questioned because of certain limitations in the
practical application of real-life QKD systems. It is a common belief the lack
of perfect single-photon source and the existence of detection loss will
handicap the feasibility of QKD by creating security loopholes and distance
limitations. The measurement device independent QKD (MDIQKD) with decoy-state
method removes the security threats from both the imperfect single-photon

rate of QKD with such a superior method is thus the central issue in the
practical application of QKD. Here, we report the results of MDIQKD over 404 km

employing an optimized four-intensity decoy-state method. This record-breaking
implementation of MDIQKD method not only provides a new distance record for
both MDIQKD and all types of QKD systems, more significantly, it achieves a
distance that the traditional BB84 QKD would not be able to achieve with the
same detection devices even with ideal single-phone sources. For the first

achieve better results than what ideal sources could have achieved. This work

  functionality</title><description>  The universal blind quantum computation protocol (UBQC) (Broadbent,
Fitzsimons, Kashefi 2009) enables an almost classical client to delegate a
quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server while the security for the
client is unconditional. In this contribution we explore the possibility of
extending the verifiable UBQC (Fitzsimons, Kashefi 2012), to achieve further
functionalities. First, exploring the asymmetric nature of UBQC (client
preparing only single qubits, while the server runs the entire quantum
computation), we present a &quot;Yao&quot; type protocol for secure two party quantum
computation. Similar to the classical setting (Yao 1986) our quantum Yao
protocol is secure against a specious (quantum honest-but-curious) garbler, but
in our case, against a (fully) malicious evaluator. Unlike the protocol in
(Dupuis, Nielsen, Salvail 2010), we do not require any online-quantum
communication between the garbler and the evaluator and thus no extra
cryptographic primitive. This feature will allow us to construct a simple
universal one-time compiler for any quantum computation using one-time memory,
in a similar way with the classical work of (Goldwasser, Kalai, Rothblum 2008)
while more efficiently than the previous work of (Broadbent, Gutoski, Stebila

processing. In particular paramagnetic rare earths could be used to build
coherent interfaces with optical and microwave photons. In addition, isotopes
with non zero nuclear spins could provide long lived states for quantum state
storage and processing. Yb3+ is particularly interesting in this respect since
it is the only paramagnetic rare earth with a spin 1/2 isotope, which
corresponds to the simplest possible level structure. In this paper, we report
on the optical and magnetic properties of Yb3+ in the two sites of Y2SiO5, a
commonly used crystal for quantum applications. We measured optical
inhomogeneous linewidths, peak absorption coefficients, oscillator strengths,
excited state lifetimes and fuorescence branching ratios. The Zeeman tensors
were also determined in the ground and excited states, as well as the ground

that Yb3+:Y2SiO5 is a promising material for applications like solid state
optical and microwave quantum memories.

hyperbolic metamaterial nano-resonators using a semi-analytical quasinormal
mode approach. We show that coupling to metamaterial nano-resonators can lead
to significant Purcell enhancements that are nearly an order of magnitude
larger than those of plasmonic resonators with comparable geometry. However,
the associated single photon output $\beta$-factors are extremely low (around
10%), far smaller than those of comparable sized metallic resonators (70%).
Using a quasinormal mode expansion of the photon Green function, we describe
how the low $\beta$-factors are due to increased Ohmic quenching arising from
redshifted resonances, larger quality factors and stronger confinement of light
within the metal. In contrast to current wisdom, these results suggest that
hyperbolic metamaterial nano-structures make poor choices for single photon
sources.

accumulation process induced by the resonant pulsed excitation in a microscopic
optical dipole trap formed by a strongly focused 1064 nm laser beam. The
heating depends on the trap frequency which restricts the maximum repetition
rate of pulsed excitation. We experimentally verify the heating of a single

excitation/cooling method. The typical trap lifetime of single Cs atom is
extended from 108 +/- 6 us to 2536 +/- 31 ms, and the corresponding number of
excitation increases from ~ 108 to ~ 360000. In applying this faster cooling
method, we use the trapped single Cs atom as a triggered single-photon source
at an excitation repetition rate of 10 MHz. The second-order intensity
correlations of the emitted single photons are characterized by implementing
Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup, and clear anti-bunching effect has been

either does not provide cooling in the steady state, or the steady state is
achieved after a long time. We propose a canonical form of qubit-bath
interaction parameters that generates transient cooling without steady-state
cooling, and claim that such a phenomenon is generic to small-scale quantum
absorption refrigerators. We also show that it is generically possible to have
fast cooling. We demonstrate our results for two separate models of

evaluate the time-dependent Casimir-Polder force on the atom, and find that it

the force, as obtained by a time-independent approach, is recovered for times
much larger than the timescale of the atomic self-dressing, but smaller than
the atomic decay time. We then discuss the evolution of global quantities such

our results for the dynamical force on the excited atom with analogous results
recently obtained for an initially bare ground-state atom. We show that new

metrology as well as testing quantum mechanics. In this work, we investigate
dissipative mechanical quantum state engineering in an optically levitated
nanodiamond. First, we study single-mode mechanical squeezed states by
magnetically coupling the mechanical motion to a dressed three-level system
provided by a Nitrogen-vacancy center in the nanoparticle. Quantum coherence
between the dressed levels is created via microwave fields to induce a
two-phonon transition, which results in mechanical squeezing. Remarkably, we
find that in ultrahigh vacuum quantum squeezing is achievable at room
temperature with feedback cooling. For moderate vacuum, quantum squeezing is
possible with cryogenic temperature. Second, we present a setup for two
mechanical modes coupled to the dressed three levels, which results in two-mode
squeezing analogous to the mechanism of the single-mode case. In contrast to
previous works, our study provides a deterministic method for engineering
macroscopic squeezed states without the requirement for a cavity.

sizeable magnetic dipole moments has realized quantum ferrofluids, a form of
fluid which combines the extraordinary properties of superfluidity and
ferrofluidity. A hallmark of superfluids is that they are constrained to
circulate through vortices with quantized circulation. These excitations
underpin a variety of rich phenomena, including vortex lattices, quantum
turbulence, the Berenzinksii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and Kibble-Zurek
defect formation. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the theory of
vortices and vortex lattices in quantum ferrofluids created from dipolar
Bose-Einstein condensates, exploring the interplay of magnetism with vorticity
and contrasting this with the established behaviour in non-dipolar condensates.
Our discussion is based on the mean-field theory provided by the dipolar
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, from analytic treatments based on the Thomas-Fermi
and variational approaches to full numerical simulations. We cover single
vortex solutions, including their structure, energy and stability, and the
interactions and dynamics of vortex pairs. Routes to generate vortices in
dipolar condensates are discussed, with particular attention to rotating
condensates, where surface instabilities drive the nucleation of vortices, and
lead to the emergence of rich and varied vortex lattice structures. Finally we
present an outlook, including potential extensions to degenerate Fermi gases,
quantum Hall physics, toroidal systems and the
Berenzinkskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

the gold standard for any optimization algorithm or machine is to sample all

Our results show that while naive transverse-field quantum annealing on the

well as a test of the ideal assumptions associated with the experiment, such as
measurement non-invasiveness. The non-invasive measurements are performed via
the modified ideal negative result measurement scheme on a three-level system.
Once these assumptions are tested, the violation becomes small, despite the

the threat of Photon Number Splitting (PNS) attacks. In this work, a detailed
analysis of the decoy state protocol is conducted which optimizes both
performance in terms of quantum throughput and security with respect to
detecting PNS attacks. The results of this study uniquely demonstrate that the
decoy state protocol can ensure PNS attacks are detected with high confidence,
while maximizing the secure key generation rate at no additional cost.
Additionally, implementation security guidance is provided for QKD system
developers and users.

field of quantum information processing and communications has made great
progress. The resulting devices feature valuable characteristics such as
scalability, reproducibility, low cost and interconnectivity, and have the
potential to revolutionize our computation and communication practices in the
future, much in the way that electronic integrated circuits have drastically
transformed our information processing capacities since the last century. Among
the multiple applications of integrated quantum technologies, this review will
focus on typical components of quantum communication systems and on overall
integrated system operation characteristics. We are interested in particular in
the use of photonic integration platforms for developing devices necessary in
quantum communications, including sources, detectors and both passive and
active optical elements. We also illustrate the challenges associated with
performing quantum communications on chip, by using the case study of quantum
key distribution - the most advanced application of quantum information
science. We conclude with promising perspectives in this field.

  optomechanics</title><description>  Ground-state cooling of mechanical oscillators in cavities opens a new arena
for exploration of quantum mechanics at mesoscopic to macroscopic scales. But
extracting quantum signatures, unambiguously distinct from very cold classical
oscillators, remains challenging. An established technique detects asymmetry in
the {\em heights} of motional sidebands of the cavity output light. We propose
instead a scheme where the {\em shape} of detected sidebands also alters when
correlations between quantum back-action and incoming quantum noise become
significant. We show this can be achieved by simultaneously modulating the
light-mechanical coupling $g$ and mechanical frequency $\omega_M$ - slowly and
out-of-phase. Such modulations are generic but occur in optically trapped
set-ups where the equilibrium point of the oscillator is varied cyclically. We
analyse recently observed split-sideband structures, in thermal regimes, and
predict how their shapes would change in the quantum limit.

operation is decomposed into a sequence of gates from a universal set,
typically one which a quantum computer can implement both efficiently and
fault-tolerantly. As physical implementations of quantum computers improve, the
need is growing for tools which can effectively synthesize components of the
circuits and algorithms they will run. Existing algorithms for exact,
multi-qubit circuit synthesis scale exponentially in the number of qubits and
circuit depth, leaving synthesis intractable for circuits on more than a
handful of qubits. Even modest improvements in circuit synthesis procedures may
lead to significant advances, pushing forward the boundaries of not only the
size of solvable circuit synthesis problems, but also in what can be realized
physically as a result of having more efficient circuits.
  We present a method for quantum circuit synthesis using deterministic walks.
Also termed pseudorandom walks, these are walks in which once a starting point
is chosen, its path is completely determined. We apply our method to construct
a parallel framework for circuit synthesis, and implement one such version
performing optimal $T$-count synthesis over the Clifford+$T$ gate set. We use
our software to present examples where parallelization offers a significant
speedup on the runtime, as well as directly confirm that the 4-qubit 1-bit full
adder has optimal $T$-count 7 and $T$-depth 3.

whose three-dimensional projection $\Theta$ is convex in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The
boundary $\partial\Theta$ of $\Theta$ may exhibit nontrivial geometry, in
particular ruled surfaces. Two physical mechanisms are known for the origins of
ruled surfaces: symmetry breaking and gapless. In this work, we study the
emergence of ruled surfaces for systems with local Hamiltonians in infinite
spatial dimension, where the reduced density matrices are known to be separable
as a consequence of the quantum de Finetti's theorem. This allows us to
identify the reduced density matrix geometry with joint product numerical range
$\Pi$ of the Hamiltonian interaction terms. We focus on the case where the
interaction terms have certain structures, such that ruled surface emerge
naturally when taking a convex hull of $\Pi$. We show that, a ruled surface on
$\partial\Theta$ sitting in $\Pi$ has a gapless origin, otherwise it has a
symmetry breaking origin. As an example, we demonstrate that a famous ruled
surface, known as the oloid, is a possible shape of $\Theta$, with two boundary
pieces of symmetry breaking origin separated by two gapless lines.
