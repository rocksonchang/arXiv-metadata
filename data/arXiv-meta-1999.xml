modulated, laser field as an example of a system that has a classical mixed
phase-space. We show a simple model to explain the momentum distribution of the
atoms taken after any distinct number of modulation cycles. The peaks
corresponding to a classical resonance move towards smaller velocities in
comparison to the velocities of the classical resonances. We explain this by
showing that, for a wave packet on the classical resonances, we can replace the
complicated dynamics in the quantum Liouville equation in phase-space by the
classical dynamics in a modified potential. Therefore we can describe the
quantum mechanical motion of a wave packet on a classical resonance by a purely
classical motion.

of quantum constraints is developed. Our constructive procedure is such that
the relevant projection operator onto the physical Hilbert space is obtained
with a single, common integration procedure over the original Lagrange
multiplier variables that is completely independent of the general nature of
the constraints. In the associated lattice-limit formulation it is demonstrated
that expansion of the constraint operator contribution to second order in the
lattice spacing is necessary while, as usual, only a first-order expansion is
needed for the dynamical operator contribution. Among various possibilities,
coherent state path integrals are used to illustrate a completely functional
representation of the abstract quantization procedure.

known that these satisfy quantum ergodicity: For almost all eigenstates, the
expectation values of quantum observables converge to the classical phase-space
average with respect to Liouville measure of the corresponding classical
observable. The possible existence of any exceptional subsequences of
eigenstates is an important issue, which until now was unresolved in any
example. The absence of exceptional subsequences is referred to as quantum
unique ergodicity (QUE). We present the first examples of maps which satisfy
QUE: Irrational skew translations of the two-torus, the parabolic analogues of
Arnold's cat maps. These maps are classically uniquely ergodic and not mixing.
A crucial step is to find a quantization recipe which respects the
quantum-classical correspondence principle. In addition to proving QUE for
these maps, we also give results on the rate of convergence to the phase-space
average. We give upper bounds which we show are optimal. We construct special
examples of these maps for which the rate of convergence is arbitrarily slow.

appeared in Barton et. al. method can also be calculated using the results of

  isotopic chiral symmetry, and parity selection rules</title><description>  The paper concerns a problem of the Dirac fermion doublet in the external
monopole potential obtained by embedding the Abelian monopole solution in the
non-Abelian scheme. In this case, the doublet-monopole Hamiltonian is invariant
under operations consisting of a complex and one parametric Abelian subgroup in
S0(3.C). This symmetry results in a certain freedom in choosing a discrete
operator N(A) (A is a complex number) entering the complete set of quantum
variables. The same complex number A represents an additional parameter at the
basis functions. The generalized inversion like operator N(A) affords certain
generalized N(A)-parity selection rules. All the different sets of basis
functions Psi(A) determine the same Hilbert space. The functions Psi(A)
decompose into linear combinations of Psi(A=0): Psi(A) = F(A) Psi(A=0).
However, the bases considered turn out to be nonorthogonal ones when A is a
complex number; the latter correlates with the non-self-conjugacy of the N(A)
at complex A-s. The meaning of possibility to violate the quantum-mechanical
regulation on self-conjugacy as regards the operator N(A) is discussed. Also,
the problem of possible physical status for the matrix F(A) at real A-s is
considered in full detail: since the matrix belongs formally to the gauge group
SU(2), but being a symmetry for the Hamiltonian this F(A) generates linear
transformations on basis wave functions.

linear spectra. The method presented enables one to exactly map these
interacting Hamiltonians to decoupled oscillators, thereby, giving a precise
correspondence between the oscillator eigenspace and the wavefunctions of these
quantum systems. The symmetries behind the degeneracy structure and the
commuting constants of motion responsible for the quantum integrability of some

well-known dynamical systems like planar oscillators with commensurate
frequencies, both with or without singular inverse-square terms and generalized
Calogero-Sutherland type models, we also point out a host of other examples
where the present approach can be profitably employed. We further study
Hamiltonians having Laughlin wavefunction as the ground-state and establish
their equivalence to free oscillators. This reveals the underlying linear
$W_{1+\infty}$ symmetry algebra unambiguously and establishes the Laughlin
wavefunction as the highest weight vector of this algebra.

similarities and differences between quantum secret sharing schemes and quantum
error-correcting codes. One remarkable difference is that, while most existing
quantum codes encode pure states as pure states, quantum secret sharing schemes
must use mixed states in some cases. For example, if k &lt;= n &lt; 2k-1 then any
((k,n)) threshold scheme must distribute information that is globally in a

subgroup $H$ of a finite Abelian group $G$. This implies that after only a
polynomial (in $\log |G|$) number of calls to the oracle function, the states
corresponding to different candidate subgroups have exponentially small inner
product. We show that this is true for noncommutative groups also. We present a
quantum algorithm which identifies a hidden subgroup of an arbitrary finite
group $G$ in only a linear (in $\log |G|$) number of calls to the oracle
function. This is exponentially better than the best classical algorithm.
However our quantum algorithm requires an exponential amount of time, as in the
classical case.

  states and evolution transport's curvature</title><description>  We propose a new systematic fibre bundle formulation of nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics. The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one
but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and
potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure
state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. It's evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\&quot;odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  The present fourth part of this series is devoted mainly to the fibre bundle
description of mixed quantum states. We show that to the conventional density
operator there corresponds a unique density morphism (along paths) for which
the corresponding equations of motion are derived. It is also investigated the
bundle description of mixed quantum states in the different pictures of motion.
We calculate the curvature of the evolution transport and prove that it is
curvature free iff the values of the Hamiltonian operator at different moments
commute.

of a bit, a 0 to a 1 and vice versa. This is accomplished by a NOT gate.
Complementing a qubit in an unknown state, however, is another matter. We show
that this operation cannot be done perfectly. We define the Universal-NOT
(U-NOT) gate which out of N identically prepared pure input qubits generates M
output qubits in a state which is as close as possible to the perfect
complement. This gate can be realized by classical estimation and subsequent
re-preparation of complements of the estimated state. Its fidelity is therefore
equal to the fidelity F= (N+1)/(N+2) of optimal estimation, and does not depend
on the required number of outputs. We also show that when some additional a
priori information about the state of input qubit is available, than the
fidelity of the quantum NOT gate can be much better than the fidelity of
estimation.

radiation and spontaneous emission by the body or black hole rotating in

caused by the interaction of the part of the liquid, which is rigidly connected
with the rotating body and thus represents the comoving detector, with the
&quot;Minkowski&quot; vacuum outside the body. The emission process is the quantum
tunneling of quasiparticles from the detector to the ergoregion, where the
energy of quasiparticles is negative in the rotating frame. This quantum
rotational friction caused by the emission of quasiparticles is estimated for
phonons and rotons in superfluid 4He and for Bogoliubov fermions in superfluid
3He.

verifiable histories which describe amplified quantum fluctuations. If the
consistent-histories formalism is to improve on the Copenhagen interpretation
by providing a self-contained quantum representation of the quasi-classical
world, the appropriate quantum state must track closely all macroscopic
phenomena, and the von Neumann entropy of that quantum state ought to change in
the same direction as the statistical entropy of the macro-world. Since the von
Neumann entropy tends to decrease under successive branchings, the evolution of
an entropy-increasing quasi-classical world is not described by the process of
branchings only: mergings of previously separate histories must also occur. As
a consequence, the number of possible quasi-classical worlds does not have to
grow indefinitely as in the many-world picture.

just by requiring the dynamical semigroup property of time evolution and
dropping the unitarity requirement. With no approximations and statistical
assumptions we find a generalized Liouville equation which depends on two
characteristic time t1 and t2 and reduces to the usual equation in the limit t1
= t2 -&gt; 0. However, for t1 and t2 arbitrarily small but finite, our equation
can be written as a finite difference equation which predicts state reduction
to the diagonal form in the energy representation. The rate of decoherence
becomes faster at the macroscopic limit as the energy scale of the system
increases. In our approach the evolution time appears, a posteriori, as a
statistical variable with a Poisson-gamma function probability distribution as
if time evolution would take place randomly at average intervals t2 each
evolution having a time width t1. This view point is supported by the
derivation of a generalized Tam Mandelstam inequality. The relation with
previous work by Milburn, with laser and micromaser theory and many

  role of absorption</title><description>  The Aharonov-Bohm scattering of charged particles by the magnetic field of an
infinitely long and infinitely thin solenoid (magnetic string) in an absorbing
medium is studied. We discuss the partial-wave approach to this problem and
show that standard partial-wave method can be adjusted to this case. The effect
of absorption leads to oscillations of the AB cross section.
  Based on this we investigate the scattering of neutral atoms with induced
electric dipole moments by a charge wire of finite radius which is placed in an
uniform magnetic field. The physical realistic and practically important case
that all atoms which collide with the wire are totally absorbed at its surface,
is studied in detail. The dominating terms of the scattering amplitude are
evaluated analytically for different physical constellations. The rest terms
are written in a form suitable for a numerical computation. We show that if the
magnetic field is absent, the absorbing charged wire causes oscillations of the
cross section. In the presence of the magnetic field the cross section
increases and the dominating Aharonov--Bohm peak appears in the forward
direction, suppressing the oscillations.

structure of general relativity, where there is one Hamiltonian constraint

of the model, which turns out to be governed by an SL(2,R) gauge symmetry,
local in time. In classical theory, we solve the equations of motion, find a
SO(2,2) algebra of Dirac observables, find the gauge transformations for the

fluxes, it also places severe restrictions upon the magnitude and extent of the
negative energy. The restrictions take the form of quantum inequalities. These
inequalities imply that a pulse of negative energy must not only be followed by
a compensating pulse of positive energy, but that the temporal separation
between the pulses is inversely proportional to their amplitude. In an earlier
paper we conjectured that there is a further constraint upon a negative and
positive energy delta-function pulse pair. This conjecture (the quantum
interest conjecture) states that a positive energy pulse must overcompensate
the negative energy pulse by an amount which is a monotonically increasing
function of the pulse separation. In the present paper we prove the conjecture
for massless quantized scalar fields in two and four-dimensional flat
spacetime, and show that it is implied by the quantum inequalities.

  Non-Markovian Dynamics, Decoherence and Relaxation</title><description>  We perform a first- principles derivation of the general master equation to
study the non-Markovian dynamics of a two-level atom (2LA) interacting with an
electromagnetic field (EMF). We use the influence functional method which can
incorporate the full backreaction of the field on the atom, while adopting
Grassmannian variables for the 2LA and the coherent state representation for
the EMF. We find exact master equations for the cases of a free quantum field
and a cavity field in the vacuum. In response to the search for mechanisms to
preserve maximal coherence in quantum computations in ion trap prototypes, we
apply these equations to analyse the decoherence of a 2LA in an EMF, and fine
that decoherence time is close to relaxation time. This is at variance to the
claims by authors who studied the same system but used a different coupling
model. We explain the source of difference and argue that, contrary to common
belief, the EMF when resonantly coupled to an atom does not decohere it as
efficiently as a bath does on a quantum Brownian particle. The master-equations
for non-Markovian dynamics derived here is expected to be useful for exploring
new regimes of 2LA-EMF interaction, which is becoming physically important
experimentally.

information about the decohering system somewhere in the universe. The known
connection between decoherence of histories and the existence of records is
extended from the case of pure initial states to mixed states. Records may
still exist but are necessarily imperfect. We formulate an
information-theoretic conjecture about decoherence due to an environment: the
number of bits required to describe a set of decoherent histories is
approximately equal to the number of bits of information thrown away to the
environment in the coarse-graining process. This idea is verified in a simple
model consisting of a particle coupled to an environment that can store only
one bit of information. We explore the decoherence and information storage in
the quantum Brownian motion model. It is shown that the variables that the
environment naturally measures and stores information about are the Fourier
components of the function $x(t)$ (describing the particle trajectory). The
records storing the information about the Fourier modes are the positions and
momenta of the environmental oscillators at the final time. Decoherence is
possible even if there is only one oscillator in the environment. The
information count of the histories and records in the environment add up
according to our conjecture. These results give quantitative content to the
idea that decoherence is related to ``information lost''.

elastic surface distortions (Rayleigh phonons). Estimates for the lifetime of
the trap ground state are given. Ions are particularly sensitive to electric
proximity fields: for a silver substrate, we find a lifetime below one second
at distances closer than some ten micrometer to the surface. Neutral atoms may
approach the surface more closely: if they have a magnetic moment, a minimum
distance of one micrometer is estimated in tight traps, the heat being
transferred via magnetic proximity fields. For spinless atoms, heat is
transferred by inelastic scattering of virtual photons off surface phonons. The
corresponding lifetime, however, is estimated to be extremely long compared to
the timescale of typical experiments.

There are two possibilities: the amount is infinite or the amount is finite. A

  Duality</title><description>  A system of two interacting, physically real, initially homogeneous fields is
considered as the simplest basis for the world construction in which one of
them, a 'protofield' of electromagnetic nature, is attracted to another
protofield, or medium, responsible for the eventually emerging gravitational
effects. The interaction process is analysed within the generalised 'effective
(optical) potential method' in which we avoid any usual perturbative reduction.
It then appears that for generic system parameters the protofields, instead of
simply 'falling' one onto another and forming a fixed 'bound state', are
engaged in a self-sustained process of nonlinear pulsation, or 'quantum beat',
consisting in unceasing cycles of self-amplified auto-squeeze, or 'collapse'
('reduction'), of a portion of the extended protofields to a small volume
followed by the inverse phase of extension. Centres of consecutive reductions
form the physical 'points' of thus emerging, intrinsically discrete space, and
each of them is 'selected' by the system in a causally random fashion among
many equally possible versions (or 'realisations'). This is a manifestation of
the dynamic redundance forming the unified basis of dynamically complex
(chaotic) behaviour of any real system with interaction (physics/9806002). The
sequence of reduction events constitutes the elementary physical 'clock' of the
world providing it with the unceasing, intrinsically irreversible time flow.
The complex-dynamical quantum beat process in the system of two interacting
protofields is observed as the massive elementary particle (like the electron)
which naturally possesses the property of physically real wave-particle duality

  Mechanics and Its Intrinsic Unification with the Causally Extended Relativity</title><description>  A system of two interacting protofields with generic parameters is unstable
with respect to unceasing cycles of nonlinear squeeze (reduction) to randomly
chosen centres and reverse extension which form the causally probabilistic
process of quantum beat observed as elementary particle (quant-ph/9902015).
Here we show that the emerging wave-particle duality, space, and time lead to
the equations of special relativity and quantum mechanics thus providing their
causal extension and unification. Relativistic inertial mass (energy) is
universally defined as the temporal rate (frequency) of the chaotic quantum
beat process(es). The same complex dynamical processes and mass account for
universal gravitation, since any reduction event in the electromagnetic
protofield involves also the (directly unobservable) gravitational protofield
thus increasing its tension and influencing quantum beat frequencies of other
particles. This complex dynamical mechanism of universal gravitation provides
causal extension of general relativity intrinsically unified with causal
quantum mechanics and special relativity, as well as physical origin and
unification of all the four 'fundamental forces' (also gr-qc/9906077). The
dynamic origin of the Dirac quantization rules is also revealed and used for
the first-principles derivation of the Dirac and Schroedinger equations
describing the same irreducibly complex, internally nonlinear interaction
processes within field-particles and their simplest systems (quant-ph/9511034 -
quant-ph/9511038). The classical, dynamically localised behaviour naturally
emerges as a higher level of complexity appearing as formation of elementary
bound systems (like atoms).

with an ``external'' motion, which can be interpreted as the motion of the
centre of mass, and an ``internal'' one, whose presence disappears in the
classical limit. The latter is caused by the spin of the particle, whatever is
its actual value (different from zero). The quantum potential in the
Schrodinger equation, which is responsible of the quantum effects of the
system, is then completely determined from the properties of the internal
motion, and its ``unusual'' properties have a simple and physical explanation
in the present context. From the impossibility to fix the initial conditions
relevant for the internal motion follows, finally, the need of a probabilistic
interpretation of quantum mechanics.

investigated. The continuous-variable teleportation protocol by Braunstein and
Kimble [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80}, 869 (1998)] for teleporting the quantum
state of a single mode of the electromagnetic field is generalized for the case
of a multimode field with finite bandwith. We discuss criteria for
continuous-variable teleportation with various sets of input states and apply
them to the teleportation of broadband fields. We first consider as a set of
input fields (from which an independent state preparer draws the inputs to be
teleported) arbitrary pure Gaussian states with unknown coherent amplitude
(squeezed or coherent states). This set of input states, further restricted to
an alphabet of coherent states, was used in the experiment by Furusawa {\it et
al.} [Science {\bf 282}, 706 (1998)]. It requires unit-gain teleportation for
optimizing the teleportation fidelity. In our broadband scheme, the excess
noise added through unit-gain teleportation due to the finite degree of the
squeezed-state entanglement is just twice the (entanglement) source's squeezing
spectrum for its ``quiet quadrature.'' The teleportation of one half of an
entangled state (two-mode squeezed vacuum state), i.e., ``entanglement
swapping,'' and its verification are optimized under a certain nonunit gain
condition. We will also give a broadband description of this
continuous-variable entanglement swapping based on the single-mode scheme by
van Loock and Braunstein [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 61}, 10302 (2000)]

just by requiring the dynamical semigroup property of time evolution and
dropping the unitarity requirement. With no approximations and specific
statistical assumptions we find a generalized Liouville equation which depends
on two characteristic time t1 and t2 and reduces to the usual equation in the
limit t1 = t2 --&gt; 0. However, for t1 and t2 arbitrarily small but finite, our
equation can be written as a finite difference equation which predicts state
reduction to the diagonal form in the energy representation. The rate of
decoherence becomes faster at the macroscopic limit as the energy scale of the
system increases. In our approach the evolution time appears, a posteriori, as
a statistical variable as if time evolution would take place randomly at
average intervals t2, each evolution having a time width t1. A generalized Tam
Mandelstam inequality is derived. The relation with previous work by Milburn is

B-freedom associated in turn with its own symmetry of the Hamiltonian. There

theory, so here we concentrate on the next-order correction corresponding to
first-order non-Markovian master equations. These perturbative equations
greatly simplify the general non-Markovian QSD approach, and allow for
efficient numerical simulations beyond the Markov approximation. Furthermore,
we show that each perturbative scheme for QSD naturally gives rise to a
perturbative scheme for the master equation which we study in some detail.
Analytical and numerical examples are presented, including the quantum Brownian
motion model.

  entanglement an inter-convertible resource?</title><description>  Entanglement bits or ``ebits'' have been proposed as a quantitative measure
of a fundamental resource in quantum information processing. For such an
interpretation to be valid, it is important to show that the same number of
ebits in different forms or concentrations are inter-convertible in the
asymptotic limit. Here we draw attention to a very important but hitherto
unnoticed aspect of entanglement manipulation --- the classical communication
cost. We construct an explicit procedure which demonstrates that for bi-partite
pure states, in the asymptotic limit, entanglement can be concentrated or
diluted with vanishing classical communication cost. Entanglement of bi-partite
pure states is thus established as a truly inter-convertible resource.

General Relativity, which includes Minimal Coupling Principle, is analyzed from
the point of view of Feynman's formulation in terms of path integrals. We will
argue from this standpoint and using an argument that claims the incompleteness
of the general-relativistic description of gravitation, which emerges as a
consequence of the gravitationally induced phases of the so called
flavor-oscillation clocks, that the postulates of Quantum Theory are logically
incompatible with the usual Minimal Coupling Principle. It will be shown that
this inconsistency could emerge from the fact that the required geometrical
information to calculate the probability of finding a particle in any point of
the respective manifold does not lie in a region with finite volume.
Afterwards, we put forth a new Quantum Minimal Coupling Principle in terms of a
restricted path integral, and along the ideas of this model not only the
propagator of a free particle is calculated but we also deduce the conditions
under which we recover Feynman's case for a free particle. The effect on
diatomic interstellar molecules is also calculated. The already existing
relation between Restricted Path Integral Formalism and Decoherence Model will
enable us to connect the issue of a Quantum Minimal Coupling Principle with the
collapse of the wave function. From this last remark we will claim that the
geometrical structure of the involved manifold acts as, an always present,
measuring device on a quantum particle. In other words, in this proposal we
connect the issue of a Quantum Minimal Coupling Principle with a claim which
states that gravity could be one of the physical entities driving the collapse
of the wave function.

Moreover, while the Universe might expand forever, the integrated conscious

simplifies. In particular the only relevant measure of the quality of the
estimation is the mean quadratic error matrix. Here we present a bound on the
mean quadratic error which is a new quantum version of the Cram\'er-Rao
inequality. This new bound expresses in a succinct way how in the quantum case
one can trade information about one parameter for information about another
parameter. The bound holds for arbitrary measurements on pure states, but only
for separable measurements on mixed states--a striking example of non-locality
without entanglement for mixed but not for pure states. Cram\'er-Rao bounds are
generally derived under the assumption that the estimator is unbiased. We also
prove that under additional regularity conditions our bound also holds for
biased estimators. Finally we prove that when the unknown states belong to a 2
dimensional Hilbert space our quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound can always be attained
and we provide an explicit measurement strategy that attains our bound. This
therefore provides a complete solution to the problem of estimating as
efficiently as possible the unknown state of a large ensemble of qubits in the
same pure state. For qubits in the same mixed state, this also provides an
optimal estimation strategy if one only considers separable measurements.

  Theory's interpretation, summary and discussion</title><description>  We propose a new systematic fibre bundle formulation of nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics. The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one
but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and
potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure
state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. It's evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\&quot;odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  This is the fifth closing part of our investigation. We briefly discuss the
observer's role in the theory and different realizations of the space-time
model used as a base space in the bundle approach to quantum mechanics. We
point the exact conditions for the equivalence of Hilbert bundle and Hilbert
space formulations of the theory. A comparison table between the both
description of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics is presented. We discuss some
principal moments of the Hilbert bundle description and show that it is more
general than the Hilbert space one. Different directions for further research
are pointed too.

of two coherent states with opposite phases in a high-Q microwave cavity, based
on the injection of appropriately prepared ``probe'' and ``feedback'' Rydberg
atoms, improving the one presented in [D. Vitali et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 79,
2442 (1997)]. In the present scheme, the information transmission from the
probe to the feedback atom is directly mediated by a second auxiliary cavity.
The detection efficiency for the probe atom is no longer a critical parameter,
and the decoherence time of the superposition state can be significantly
increased using presently available technology.

a completely absorbing shutter on which were impinging a stream of particles of
definite velocity. The solution of the problem was obtained in a form entirely
analogous to the optical one of diffraction by a straight edge. The argument of
the Fresnel integrals was though time dependent and thus the first part in the
title of this article. In section 1 we briefly review the original formulation
of the problem of diffraction in time. In section 2 and 3 we reformulate
respectively this problem in Wigner distributions and tomographical
probabilities. In the former case the probability in phase space is very simple
but, as it takes positive and negative values, the interpretation is ambiguous,
but it gives a classical limit that agrees entirely with our intuition. In the
latter case we can start with our initial conditions in a given reference frame
but obtain our final solution in an arbitrary frame of reference.

  dielectrics and dense atomic gases: A Green's function approach</title><description>  Spontaneous emission and Lamb shift of atoms in absorbing dielectrics are
discussed. A Green's-function approach is used based on the multipolar
interaction Hamiltonian of a collection of atomic dipoles with the quantised
radiation field. The rate of decay and level shifts are determined by the
retarded Green's-function of the interacting electric displacement field, which
is calculated from a Dyson equation describing multiple scattering. The
positions of the atomic dipoles forming the dielectrics are assumed to be
uncorrelated and a continuum approximation is used. The associated unphysical
interactions between different atoms at the same location is eliminated by
removing the point-interaction term from the free-space Green's-function (local
field correction). For the case of an atom in a purely dispersive medium the
spontaneous emission rate is altered by the well-known Lorentz local-field
factor. In the presence of absorption a result different from previously
suggested expressions is found and nearest-neighbour interactions are shown to
be important.

potential V(r) proportional to the inverse power of r of degree beta in an
arbitrary number of spatial dimensions. The presence of a single term in the
potential makes it impossible to use previous algorithms, which only work for
quasi-exactly-solvable problems. Nevertheless, the analysis of the stationary
Schrodinger equation in the neighbourhood of the origin and of the point at
infinity is found to provide relevant information about the desired solutions
for all values of the radial coordinate. The original eigenvalue equation is
mapped into a differential equation with milder singularities, and the role
played by the particular case beta=4 is elucidated. In general, whenever the
parameter beta is even and larger than 4, a recursive algorithm for the
evaluation of eigenfunctions is obtained. Eventually, in the particular case of
two spatial dimensions, the exact form of the ground-state wave function is
obtained for a potential containing a finite number of inverse powers of r,
with the associated energy eigenvalue.

local operations at each end and classical communication between Alice and Bob.
A method is developed in which this type of problem is found to be equivalent

certain colouring problem. We consider two problems. Firstly we find the most
general way of manipulating the state to obtain maximally entangled states.
After such a manipulation the entangled state |11&gt;+|22&gt;+....|mm&gt; is obtained

accept non-regular languages with bounded error in polynomial time. If we
restrict the head of the automaton to moving classically and to moving only in
one direction, the acceptance power of this 1-way quantum finite automaton is
reduced to a proper subset of the regular languages.
  In this paper we study two different models of 1-way quantum finite automata.
The first model, termed measure-once quantum finite automata, was introduced by
Moore and Crutchfield, and the second model, termed measure-many quantum finite
automata, was introduced by Kondacs and Watrous.
  We characterize the measure-once model when it is restricted to accepting
with bounded error and show that, without that restriction, it can solve the
word problem over the free group. We also show that it can be simulated by a
probabilistic finite automaton and describe an algorithm that determines if two
measure-once automata are equivalent.
  We prove several closure properties of the classes of languages accepted by
measure-many automata, including inverse homomorphisms, and provide a new
necessary condition for a language to be accepted by the measure-many model
with bounded error. Finally, we show that piecewise testable languages can be
accepted with bounded error by a measure-many quantum finite automaton, in the
process introducing new construction techniques for quantum automata.

provide a semigroup (exponential) decay law. The Wigner-Weisskopf survival
amplitude, describing reversible quantum transitions, may be dominated by
exponential type decay in pole approximation at times not too short or too
long, but, in the two channel case, for example, the pole residues are not
orthogonal, and the evolution does not correspond to a semigroup (experiments
on the decay of the neutral $K$-meson system strongly support the semigroup
evolution postulated by Lee, Oehme and Yang, and Yang and Wu). The scattering
theory of Lax and Phillips, originally developed for classical wave equations,
has been recently extended to the description of the evolution of resonant
states in the framework of quantum theory. The resulting evolution law of the
unstable system is that of a semigroup, and the resonant state is a
well-defined function in the Lax-Phillips Hilbert space. In this paper we apply
this theory to a relativistically covariant quantum field theoretical form of
the (soluble) Lee model. We construct the translation representations with the
help of the wave operators, and show that the resulting Lax-Phillips $S$-matrix
is an inner function (the Lax-Phillips theory is essentially a theory of
translation invariant subspaces). In the special case that the $S$-matrix is a
rational inner function, we obtain the resonant state explicitly and analyze
its particle ($V, N, \theta$) content. If there is an exponential bound, the
general case differs only by a so-called trivial inner factor, which does not
change the complex spectrum, but may affect the wave function of the resonant
state.

It is demonstrated that the number of bound states with even (odd) parity

the scattering states with the same parity at zero momentum as
$\eta_{+}(0)+\pi/2=n_{+}\pi, \eta_{-}(0)=n_{-}\pi$, for the non-critical case,
$\eta_{+}(0)=n_{+}\pi, \eta_{-}(0)-\pi/2=n_{-}\pi$, for the critical case.

  the Pauli Principle for Nucleons and Quarks</title><description>  The quon algebra gives a description of particles, ``quons,'' that are
neither fermions nor bosons. The parameter $q$ attached to a quon labels a
smooth interpolation between bosons, for which $q = +1$, and fermions, for
which $q = -1$. Wigner and Ehrenfest and Oppenheimer showed that a composite
system of identical bosons and fermions is a fermion if it contains an odd
number of fermions and is a boson otherwise. Here we generalize this result to
composite systems of identical quons. We find
$q_{composite}=q_{constituent}^{n^2}$ for a system of $n$ identical quons. This
result reduces to the earlier result for bosons and fermions. Using this
generalization we find bounds on possible violations of the Pauli exclusion
principle for nucleons and quarks based on such bounds for nuclei.

  Oscillator</title><description>  The damped harmonic oscillator is a workhorse for the study of dissipation in
quantum mechanics. However, despite its simplicity, this system has given rise
to some approximations whose validity and relation to more refined descriptions
deserve a thorough investigation. In this work, we apply a method that allows
us to diagonalize exactly the dissipative Hamiltonians that are frequently
adopted in the literature. Using this method we derive the conditions of
validity of the rotating-wave approximation (RWA) and show how this approximate
description relates to more general ones. We also show that the existence of
dissipative coherent states is intimately related to the RWA. Finally, through
the evaluation of the dynamics of the damped oscillator, we notice an important
property of the dissipative model that has not been properly accounted for in
previous works; namely, the necessity of new constraints to the application of
the factorizable initial conditions.

equilibrium state rho which is almost completely mixed. One interpretation of
this state is that it represents an ensemble average, and that an individual
atom is at any time in one of the eigenstates of $\rho$. The theory of Teich
and Mahler [Phys. Rev. A 45, 3300 (1992)] makes this interpretation concrete,
with an individual atom jumping stochastically between the two eigenstates when
a photon is emitted. The dressed atom theory is also supposed to describe the
quantum jumps of an individual atom due to photo-emissions. But the two
pictures are contradictory because the dressed states of the atom are almost
orthogonal to the eigenstates of $\rho$. In this paper we investigate three
ways of measuring the field radiated by the atom, which attempt to reproduce
the simple quantum jump dynamics of the dressed state or Teich and Mahler
models. These are: spectral detection (using optical filters), two-state jumps
(using adaptive homodyne detection) and orthogonal jumps (another adaptive
homodyne scheme). We find that the three schemes closely mimic the jumps of the
dressed state model, with errors of order $(3/4) (\gamma/\Omega)^{2/3}$, $(1/4)
(\gamma/\Omega)^{2}$, and $(3/4) (\gamma/\Omega)^{2}$ respectively. The
significance of this result to the program of environmentally-induced
superselection is discussed.

  Schwinger-Dyson to Boltzmann-Langevin equation</title><description>  The aim of this paper is two-fold: in probing the statistical mechanical
properties of interacting quantum fields, and in providing a field theoretical
justification for a stochastic source term in the Boltzmann equation. We start
with the formulation of quantum field theory in terms of the Schwinger - Dyson
equations for the correlation functions, which we describe by a
closed-time-path master ($n = \infty PI$) effective action. When the hierarchy
is truncated, one obtains the ordinary closed-system of correlation functions
up to a certain order, and from the nPI effective action, a set of
time-reversal invariant equations of motion. But when the effect of the higher
order correlation functions is included (through e.g., causal factorization--
molecular chaos -- conditions, which we call 'slaving'), in the form of a
correlation noise, the dynamics of the lower order correlations shows
dissipative features, as familiar in the field-theory version of Boltzmann
equation. We show that fluctuation-dissipation relations exist for such
effectively open systems, and use them to show that such a stochastic term,
which explicitly introduces quantum fluctuations on the lower order correlation
functions, necessarily accompanies the dissipative term, thus leading to a
Boltzmann-Langevin equation which depicts both the dissipative and stochastic
dynamics of correlation functions in quantum field theory.

harmonic oscillator, and an accurate estimate of ground-state energy and
specific heat for a single-well quartic anharmonic oscillator. As QSM can be
regarded as finite temperature field theory at a point, we make use of Feynman
diagrams to illustrate the non-perturbative character of the series: it
contains all powers of $\hbar$ and graphs with any number of loops; the usual
perturbative series corresponds to a subset of the diagrams of the
semiclassical series. We comment on the application of our results to other

AC^0 of constant-depth circuits with AND and OR gates of arbitrary fan-in, and
QACC^0[q], where n-ary Mod-q gates are also allowed. We show that it is
possible to make a `cat' state on n qubits in constant depth if and only if we
can construct a parity or Mod-2 gate in constant depth; therefore, any circuit
class that can fan out a qubit to n copies in constant depth also includes
QACC^0[2]. In addition, we prove the somewhat surprising result that parity or
fanout allows us to construct Mod-q gates in constant depth for any q, so
QACC^0[2] = QACC^0. Since ACC^0[p] != ACC^0[q] whenever p and q are mutually
prime, QACC^0[2] is strictly more powerful than its classical counterpart, as
is QAC^0 when fanout is allowed.

It extends
the meaning of ``measurement'' to include all property-indicating facts.
Intrinsically space is undifferentiated: there are no points on which a world
of locally instantiated physical properties could be built. Instead, reality is
built on facts, in the sense that the properties of things are extrinsic, or
supervenient on property-indicating facts. The actual extent to which the world
is spatially and temporally differentiated (that is, the extent to which
spatiotemporal relations and distinctions are warranted by the facts) is
necessarily limited. Notwithstanding that the state vector does nothing but
assign probabilities, quantum mechanics affords a complete understanding of the
actual world. If there is anything that is incomplete, it is the actual world,
but its incompleteness exists only in relation to a conceptual framework that
is more detailed than the actual world. Two deep-seated misconceptions are
responsible for the interpretational difficulties associated with quantum
mechanics: the notion that the spatial and temporal aspects of the world are
adequately represented by sets with the cardinality of the real numbers, and
the notion of an instantaneous state that evolves in time. The latter is an
unwarranted (in fact, incoherent) projection of our apparent ``motion in time''
into the world of physics. Equally unwarranted, at bottom, is the use of causal
concepts. There nevertheless exists a ``classical'' domain in which language
suggestive of nomological necessity may be used. Quantum mechanics not only is
strictly consistent with the existence of this domain but also presupposes it
in several ways.

interpretation about quantum mechanics, including the meaning of wave function,
the potential barrier penetration of microparticles, the Uncertainty relation,

types of statistics that are neither Bose nor Fermi, I discuss quons, particles
characterized by the parameter $q$, which permit a smooth interpolation between
Bose and Fermi statistics; $q=1$ gives bosons, $q=-1$ gives fermions. The new

heuristic argument for an extension of conservation of statistics to quons with
trilinear couplings of the form $\bar{f}fb$, where $f$ is fermion-like and $b$

Unlike earlier attempts, it allows us to use strictly continuous and

variables, leading to fermionic degrees of freedom, are also welcome), and we
show how an effective Hilbert space of quantum states naturally emerges when
one attempts to describe the solutions statistically. Our theory removes some

derivative and with bounded support arise in a natural way in various
situations in physics, in particular in measurement theory. The propagation of
such initial wave functions is not well described by the Schr\&quot;odinger current
which vanishes on the boundary of the support of the wave function. This
propagation gives rise to a uni-directional current at the boundary of the
support. We use path integrals to define current and uni-directional current
and give a direct derivation of the expression for current from the path
integral formulation for both diffusion and quantum mechanics. Furthermore, we
give an explicit asymptotic expression for the short time propagation of
initial wave function with compact support for both the cases of discontinuous
derivative and discontinuous wave function. We show that in the former case the
probability propagated across the boundary of the support in time $\Delta t$ is
$O(\Delta t^{3/2})$ and the initial uni-directional current is $O(\Delta
t^{1/2})$. This recovers the Zeno effect for continuous detection of a particle
in a given domain. For the latter case the probability propagated across the
boundary of the support in time $\Delta t$ is $O(\Delta t^{1/2})$ and the
initial uni-directional current is $O(\Delta t^{-1/2})$. This is an anti-Zeno
effect. However, the probability propagated across a point located at a finite
distance from the boundary of the support is $O(\Delta t)$. This gives a decay
law.

The motion of a relativistic particle in
relation to its interaction with the medium is discussed. It is predicted that
elementary excitations of the vacuum, called &quot;inertons,&quot; should exist. The
equations of the particle path in Euclidean space are derived. The motion is
marked by the relations basic for quantum mechanics: $E=h\nu$ and $Mv = h/
\lambda$ (here, $\lambda$ is the amplitude of spatial oscillations of the
particle along the trajectory, i.e., the interval at which the velocity of the
particle is periodically altered from $v$ to 0 and then from 0 to $v$; $\nu$ is
the frequency of these oscillations). Analysis is performed on the transition
to wave mechanics where $\lambda$ manifests itself as the de Broglie wavelength
and $\nu$ is the distinctive frequency of the &quot;particle-wave&quot;. A prerequisite
for the wave solution to be Lorentz-invariant is treated. A hypothesis for a
plausible hydrodynamic description of the relativistic particle motion is
covered.

spin state of such systems has a profound impact on the orbital states

We discuss the limitations of the measurement imposed by spin scattering

medium can be adiabatically eliminated is $\ell_{0}=\kappa/2\bar{n}$. Here
$\kappa$ is the intensity damping rate and $\bar{n}$ the mean photon number.
This contains equal contributions from the loss and gain processes, so that
simple arguments which attribute the linewidth wholly to phase noise from
spontaneous gain are wrong. I show that an {\em unstimulated} gain process
actually introduces no phase noise, so that the ultimate quantum limit to the
laser linewidth comes from the loss alone and is equal to $\ell_{ult}=
\kappa/4\bar{n}$. I investigate a number of physical gain mechanisms which
attempt to achieve gain without phase noise: a linear atom-field coupling with
finite interaction time; a nonlinear atom-field coupling; and adiabatic photon

a coupling proportional to the pump pulse and to the final state $\state{f}$
with a coupling proportional to the Stokes pulse, thus forming a parallel
multi-$\Lambda$ system. It is shown that the dark (trapped) state exists only
when the ratio between each pump coupling and the respective Stokes coupling is
the same for all intermediate states. We derive the conditions for existence of
a more general adiabatic-transfer state which includes transient contributions
from the intermediate states but still transfers the population from state
$\state{i}$ to state $\state{f}$ in the adiabatic limit. We present various
numerical examples for success and failure of multi-$\Lambda$ STIRAP which
illustrate the analytic predictions. Our results suggest that in the general
case of arbitrary couplings, it is most appropriate to tune the pump and Stokes
lasers either just below or just above all intermediate states.

Bohr-Sommerfeld form. They arise from bilinear (Wronskian) functional relations
pairing spectral determinants of (N+2) generically distinct operators, all the
transforms of one quantum Hamiltonian under a cyclic group of complex scalings.
The determinants' zeros define (N+2) semi-infinite chains of points in the
complex spectral plane, and they encode the original quantum problem. Each
chain can now be described by an exact quantization condition which constrains
it in terms of its neighbors, resulting in closed equilibrium conditions for
the global chain system; these are supplemented by the standard
(Bohr-Sommerfeld) quantization conditions, which bind the infinite tail of each
chain asymptotically. This reduced problem is then probed numerically for
effective solvability upon test cases (mostly, symmetric quartic oscillators):
we find that the iterative enforcement of all the quantization conditions
generates discrete chain dynamics which appear to converge geometrically
towards the correct eigenvalues/eigenfunctions. We conjecture that the exact
quantization then acts by specifying reduced chain dynamics which can be stable
(contractive) and thus determine the exact quantum data as their fixed point.
(To date, this statement is verified only empirically and in a vicinity of

through the state-space evolution generated by the dynamic quantum Zeno effect.
That is, a system is guided through a closed loop in Hilbert space by means a
sequence of closely spaced projections leading to a phase difference with
respect to the original state. Our goal is the proposal of a specific
experimental setup in which this phase could be created and observed. To this

an unambiguous description of the quantal dynamics. This is shown explicitly
for a single spin s, using a quorum of expectation values which contains no
redundant information. The quantum mechanical time evolution of the system is
rephrased in terms of a closed set of linear first-order differential equations

refers neither to the wavefunction of the system nor to its statistical

particles have harmonic interactions. Here we generalise these results by
solving exactly the N-body Schrodinger equation for potentials V that can be
any function of the sum of the squares of the distances of the particles from
one another in 3 dimensions. For the harmonic case that function is linear in
r^2. Explicit N-body solutions are given when U(r) = -2M \hbar^{-2} V(r) =
\zeta r^{-1} - \zeta_2 r^{-2}. Here M is the sum of the masses and r^2 = 1/2
M^{-2} Sigma Sigma m_I m_J ({\bf x}_I - {\bf x}_J)^2. For general U(r) the
solution is given in terms of the one or two body problem with potential U(r)
in 3 dimensions. The degeneracies of the levels are derived for distinguishable
particles, for Bosons of spin zero and for spin 1/2 Fermions. The latter
involve significant combinatorial analysis which may have application to the
shell model of atomic nuclei. For large N the Fermionic ground state gives the
binding energy of a degenerate white dwarf star treated as a giant atom with an
N-body wave function. The N-body forces involved in these extraordinary N-body
problems are not the usual sums of two body interactions, but nor are forces
between quarks or molecules. Bose-Einstein condensation of particles in 3
dimensions interacting via these strange potentials can be treated by this
method.

formalism which constitutes a complete theory compatible with relativistic
quantum field theory. In this paper, which could also serve as an introduction
to the earlier papers, three issues are discussed. First, a significant, but
fairly straightforward, revision in some of the technical details is proposed.
This is used as an opportunity to introduce the formalism. Then the
probabilistic structure of the theory is revised, and it is proposed that the
experience of an individual observer can be modelled as the experience of
observing a particular, identified, discrete stochastic process. Finally, it is
argued that the formalism can be modified to give a physics in which no
constants are required. Instead, `constants' have to be determined by
observation, and are fixed only to the extent to which they have been observed.

predicted. After this preliminary check we shall deal with the physical

I: The Physical Scenario</title><description>  Several years ago Schwinger proposed a physical mechanism for
sonoluminescence in terms of changes in the properties of the
quantum-electrodynamic (QED) vacuum state. This mechanism is most often phrased
in terms of changes in the Casimir Energy: changes in the distribution of
zero-point energies and has recently been the subject of considerable
controversy. The present paper further develops this quantum-vacuum approach to
sonoluminescence: We calculate Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum
states in the presence of a homogeneous medium of changing dielectric constant.
In this way we derive an estimate for the spectrum, number of photons, and
total energy emitted. We emphasize the importance of rapid spatio-temporal
changes in refractive indices, and the delicate sensitivity of the emitted
radiation to the precise dependence of the refractive index as a function of
wavenumber, pressure, temperature, and noble gas admixture. Although the
physics of the dynamical Casimir effect is a universal phenomenon of QED,
specific experimental features are encoded in the condensed matter physics
controlling the details of the refractive index. This calculation places rather
tight constraints on the possibility of using the dynamical Casimir effect as
an explanation for sonoluminescence, and we are hopeful that this scenario will
soon be amenable to direct experimental probes. In a companion paper we discuss
the technical complications due to finite-size effects, but for reasons of
clarity in this paper we confine attention to bulk effects.

achievable without entanglement. The enhancement factor is greatest for very
noisy channels, with positive classical capacity but zero quantum capacity.
Although such quantum channels can be simulated classically, no violation of

  Spectroscopy</title><description>  Using a feedback loop it is possible to reduce the fluctuations in one
quadrature of an in-loop field without increasing the fluctuations in the
other. This effect has been known for a long time, and has recently been called
``squashing'' [B.C. Buchler et al., Optics Letters {\bf 24}, 259 (1999)], as
opposed to the ``squeezing'' of a free field in which the conjugate
fluctuations are increased. In this paper I present a general theory of
squashing, including simultaneous squashing of both quadratures and
simultaneous squeezing and squashing. I show that a two-level atom coupled to
the in-loop light feels the effect of the fluctuations as calculated by the
theory. In the ideal limit of light squeezed in one quadrature and squashed in
the other, the atomic decay can be completely suppressed.

material, is an essential precursor to their use for the encryption and
decryption of confidential communications. Quantum cryptography is a new
technique for secure key distribution with single-photon transmissions:
Heisenberg's uncertainty principle ensures that an adversary can neither
successfully tap the key transmissions, nor evade detection (eavesdropping
raises the key error rate above a threshold value). We have developed
experimental quantum cryptography systems based on the transmission of
non-orthogonal photon states to generate shared key material over
multi-kilometer optical fiber paths and over line-of-sight links. In both
cases, key material is built up using the transmission of a single-photon per
bit of an initial secret random sequence. A quantum-mechanically random subset
of this sequence is identified, becoming the key material after a data
reconciliation stage with the sender. Here we report the most recent results of
our optical fiber experiment in which we have performed quantum key
distribution over a 48-km optical fiber network at Los Alamos using photon
interference states with the B92 and BB84 quantum key distribution protocols.

on quantized translations. Thus, the symbol of any operator on the torus is

The Faraday effect acts both as a phase-shifter and as a filter for circular

are relevant to the traversal time measurements. The Faraday polarization
filtering may cause the loss of non-local (Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen) two-photon

excitation between the atom and the cavity, in order to realize nearly unitary
dynamics of the internal atomic states and the cavity mode which is required
for several schemes of current interest such as quantum computing. Using a

characterized by a measure based on the entanglement fidelity and the motional

perturbations that possess a built in scale are studied. It is demonstrated
that this assumption leads to a falsifiable class of models. The question of
whether they lead to conflicts with the available observations is addressed.
For this purpose, the power spectrum of the Bardeen potential operator is
calculated and compared with the CMBR anisotropies measurements and the
redshift surveys of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Generic predictions of
the model are: a high first acoustic peak, the presence of a bump in the matter
power spectrum and non-Gaussian statistics. The details are controlled by the
number of quanta in the non-vacuum initial state. Comparisons with observations
show that there exists a window for the free parameters such that good
agreement between the data and the theoretical predictions is possible.
However, in the case where the initial state is a state with a fixed number of
quanta, it is shown that this number cannot be greater than a few. On the other
hand, if the initial state is a quantum superposition, then a larger class of
initial states could account for the observations, even though the state cannot
be too different from the vacuum. Planned missions such as the MAP and Planck
satellites and the Sloan Survey, will demonstrate whether the new class of
models proposed here represents a viable alternative to the standard theory.

Schroedinger equation proposed by Hudson and Parthasarathy fifteen years ago,
we show that such models can be generalized to include other processes into the
interaction. In the case of a two-level atom we construct a model in which the
interaction with the field is due either to absorption/emission processes
either to direct scattering processes, which simulate the interaction due to
virtual transitions to the levels which have been eliminated from the
description. To see the effects of the new terms, the total, elastic and
inelastic eloctromagnetic cross sections are studied. The new power spectrum is
compared with Mollow's results.

  Model</title><description>  The phenomenon of atomic population trapping in the Jaynes-Cummings Model is
analysed from a dressed-state point of view. A general condition for the
occurrence of partial or total trapping from an arbitrary, pure initial
atom-field state is obtained in the form of a bound to the variation of the
atomic inversion. More generally, it is found that in the presence of initial
atomic or atom-field coherence the population dynamics is governed not by the
field's initial photon distribution, but by a `weighted dressedness'
distribution characterising the joint atom-field state. In particular,
individual revivals in the inversion can be analytically described to good
approximation in terms of that distribution, even in the limit of large
population trapping. This result is obtained through a generalisation of the
Poisson Summation Formula method for analytical description of revivals
developed by Fleischhauer and Schleich [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 47}, 4258 (1993)].

usual teleportation and in the second stage, the preparer disentangles the
left-over entangled states by a single particle measurement process and
communicates a number of classical bits (1-cbit per copy) to different parties

exact unperturbed solution), variational techniques represent the main tool for
any investigation of the eigenvalue problem of some semibounded operator H in
quantum theory. For a reasonable choice of the employed trial subspace of the
domain of H, the lowest eigenvalues of H usually can be located with acceptable
precision whereas the trial-subspace vectors corresponding to these eigenvalues
approximate, in general, the exact eigenstates of H with much less accuracy.
Accordingly, various measures for the accuracy of the approximate eigenstates
derived by variational techniques are scrutinized. In particular, the matrix
elements of the commutator of the operator H and (suitably chosen) different
operators with respect to degenerate approximate eigenstates of H obtained by
variational methods are proposed as new criteria for the accuracy of
variational eigenstates. These considerations are applied to precisely that
Hamiltonian for which the eigenvalue problem defines the well-known spinless
Salpeter equation. This bound-state wave equation may be regarded as (the most
straightforward) relativistic generalization of the usual nonrelativistic
Schroedinger formalism, and is frequently used to describe, e.g., spin-averaged
mass spectra of bound states of quarks.

study in a systematic way how superspace groups and algebras arise from
Grassmann spinors when these are assumed to be the only primary entities. In
the process, we recover generalized spacetime superalgebras and extensions of
supersymmetry found earlier. The enlargement of ordinary superspace with new
parameters gives rise to extended superspace groups, on which manifestly
supersymmetric actions may be constructed for various types of p-branes,
including D-branes (given by Chevalley-Eilenberg cocycles) with their
Born-Infeld fields. This results in a field/extended superspace democracy for
superbranes: all brane fields appear as pull-backs from a suitable target
superspace. Our approach also clarifies some facts concerning the origin of the

these outcomes interferometrically using a double slit interferometer modified

random bit. At the least in the quantum version, each participant test whether
or not the other has attempted to create a bias on this bit. It is requested
that, for b = 0,1, the probability that Alice gets bit b and pass the test is
smaller than 1/2 whatever she does, and similarly for Bob. If the bound 1/2
holds perfectly against any of the two participants, the task realised is
called an exact coin tossing. If the bound is actually $1/2 + \xi$ where the
bias $\xi$ vanishes when a security parameter m defined by the protocol
increases, the task realised is a (non exact) coin tossing. It is found here
that exact coin tossing is impossible. At the same time, an unconditionally
secure quantum protocol that realises a (non exact) coin tossing is proposed.
The protocol executes m biased quantum coin tossing procedures at the same
time. It executes the first round in each of these m procedures sequentially,
then the second rounds are executed, and so on until the end of the n
procedures. Each procedure requires 4n particles where $n \in O(\lg m)$. The
final bit x is the parity of the m random bits. The information about each of
these m bits is announced a little bit at a time which implies that the
principle used against bit commitment does not apply. The bias on x is smaller
than $1/m$. The result is discussed in the light of the impossibility result
for exact coin tossing.

  Equations</title><description>  We consider fifth-order nonlinear dispersive $K(m,n,p)$ type equations to
study the effect of nonlinear dispersion. Using simple scaling arguments we
show, how, instead of the conventional solitary waves like solitons, the
interaction of the nonlinear dispersion with nonlinear convection generates
compactons - the compact solitary waves free of exponential tails. This
interaction also generates many other solitary wave structures like cuspons,
peakons, tipons etc. which are otherwise unattainable with linear dispersion.
Various self similar solutions of these higher order nonlinear dispersive
equations are also obtained using similarity transformations. Further, it is
shown that, like the third-order nonlinear $K(m,n)$ equations, the fifth-order
nonlinear dispersive equations also have the same four conserved quantities and
further even any arbitrary odd order nonlinear dispersive $K(m,n,p...)$ type
equations also have the same three (and most likely the four) conserved
quantities. Finally, the stability of the compacton solutions for the
fifth-order nonlinear dispersive equations are studied using linear stability
analysis. From the results of the linear stability analysis it follows that,
unlike solitons, all the allowed compacton solutions are stable, since the
stability conditions are satisfied for arbitrary values of the nonlinear
parameters.

existence of a corresponding element of reality. Recently Vaidman has extended
this idea to the ABL probabilities of the time-symmetrized version of quantum
mechanics originated by Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz. Several authors have
objected to Vaidman's time-symmetrized elements of reality without casting
doubt on the widely accepted sufficiency condition for `ordinary' elements of
reality. In this paper I show that while the proper truth condition for a
quantum counterfactual is an ABL probability of 1, neither a Born probability
of 1 nor an ABL probability of 1 is sufficient for the existence of an element
of reality. The reason this is so is that the contingent properties of
quantum-mechanical systems are extrinsic. To obtain this result, I need to
discuss objective probabilities, retroactive causality, and the objectivity or
otherwise of the psychological arrow of time. One consequence of the extrinsic
nature of quantum-mechanical properties is that quantum mechanics presupposes
property-defining actual events (or states of affairs) and therefore cannot be
called upon to account for their occurrence (existence). Neither these events
nor the correlations between them are capable of explanation, the former
because they are causal primaries, the latter because they are fundamental:
there are no underlying causal processes. Causal connections are something we
project onto the statistical correlations, and this works only to the extent
that statistical variations can be ignored. There are nevertheless important
conclusions to be drawn from the quantum-mechanical correlations, such as the
spatial nonseparability of the world.

The ambient diffeomorphism deformations of first-order embedded submanifolds

algebra, the structure functions being the Cartan structure functions on the
ambient manifold. We define the covariant kinematical phase space of
pseudoholomorphic embeddings (the symplectic 2-submanifolds of a symplectic

embeddings. The induced algebra of Noether currents satisfies the same algebra
as before, the symmetry thus being preserved on this subclass of embeddings.
The graded multisymplectic manifolds of the covariant Hamiltonian BRST
formalism, developed by the author, are explicitly constructed for the symmetry
of embeddings and pseudoholomorphic embedding.The ``(supersymmetry) multiplet
and its dualities'' postulated by Witten arise naturally as the local fibre
coordinates on the graded phase space. The BRST algebra for the

  Effect in 1+1 Dimensions</title><description>  We present an approach to studying the Casimir effects by means of the
effective theory. An essential point of our approach is replacing the mirror
separation into the size of space S^1 in the adiabatic approximation. It is
natural to identify the size of space S^1 with the scale factor of the
Robertson-Walker-type metric. This replacement simplifies the construction of a
class of effective models to study the Casimir effects. To check the validity
of this replacement we construct a model for a scalar field coupling to the
two-dimensional gravity and calculate the Casimir effects by the effective
action for the variable scale factor. Our effective action consists of the
classical kinetic term of the mirror separation and the quantum correction
derived by the path-integral method. The quantum correction naturally contains
both the Casimir energy term and the back-reaction term of the dynamical
Casimir effect, the latter of which is expressed by the conformal anomaly. The
resultant effective action describes the dynamical vacuum pressure, i.e., the
dynamical Casimir force. We confirm that the force depends on the relative
velocity of the mirrors, and that it is always attractive and stronger than the
static Casimir force within the adiabatic approximation.

  Reconstruction Method using Coherent States</title><description>  To reconstruct a mixed or pure quantum state of a spin s is possible through
coherent states: its density matrix is fixed by the probabilities to measure
the value s along 4s(s+1) appropriately chosen directions in space. Thus, after
inverting the experimental data, the statistical operator is parametrized
entirely by expectation values. On this basis, a symbolic calculus for quantum
spins is developed, the `expectation-value representation.' It resembles the
Moyal representation for SU(2) but two important differences exist. On the one
hand, the symbols take values on a discrete set of points in phase space only.
On the other hand, no quasi-probabilities - that is, phase-space distributions
with negative values - are encountered in this approach.

volume elements of the Bures (minimal monotone) metric for n = 2 and 3,
obtaining thereby &quot;Bures prior probability distributions&quot; over the two- and
three-state systems. Then, as an essential first step in extending these

for the marginal Bures prior probability distribution over the
(n-1)-dimensional simplex of the n eigenvalues of the n x n density matrices
is, for n = 4, equal to 71680/pi^2. Since we also find that C_{3} = 35/pi, it
follows that C_{4} is simply equal to 2^{11} C_{3}/pi. (C_{2} itself is known
to equal 2/pi.) The constant C_{5} is also found. It too is associated with a
remarkably simple decompositon, involving the product of the eight consecutive

 We also preliminarily investigate several cases, n &gt; 5, with the use of
quasi-Monte Carlo integration. We hope that the various analyses reported will
prove useful in deriving a general formula (which evidence suggests will
involve the Bernoulli numbers) for the Hall normalization constant for
arbitrary n. This would have diverse applications, including quantum inference

for any polynomial $\tilde{f}$ that approximates $f$ with error probability
$\epsilon$, $deg(\tilde{f}) \ge 1/4 (1 - \frac{3 \epsilon}{1 + \epsilon})^2

expressions are derived, in the transverse trace-free gauge, for the summation

Because of the fluctuating light cone, the flight time of photons between a

propagation time in the background classical spacetime. We calculate the mean
deviations from the classical propagation time of photons due to the changes in
the topology of the flat spacetime. These deviations are in general larger in
the directions in which topology changes occur and are typically of the order
of the Planck time, but they can get larger as the travel distance increases.

investigation in non-equilibrium quantum theory is the stochastic limit method.
This method is an extension of the works by Bogoliubov, van Hove and Prigogine
and it permits to study not only the system but also the reservoir degrees of
freedom. We consider the stochastic limit of translation invariant Hamiltonians
in quantum field theory and show that the master field satisfies a new type of
commutation relations, the so called entangled (or interacting) commutation
relations. These relations extend the interacting Fock relations established
earlier in non-relativistic QED and the free (or Boltzmann) commutation
relations which have been found in the large N limit of QCD. As an application

deformed algebras, including quadratic, Higgs and q-deformed algebras, which
are relevant for many physical problems. For the non-compact cases, coherent

connection between wave mechanics and matrix mechanics. The connection between
the differential eigenvalue equation and the matrix eigenvalue equation for an

vector state are probability amplitudes with a structure rather than being mere
constants. We obtain the most general expressions for the probability
amplitudes for the description of spin-1/2 measurements. As a result, we derive
spin-1/2 operators and vectors from first principles. The procedure used is

shown to reduce to the Pauli spin matrices and vectors in an appropriate limit.

the time evolution of wave packets representing spatial orientation of
internuclear axis of diatomic molecule. Two examples are considered in detail.
Molecules absorbing light in a permanent magnetic field experiencing Zeeman
effect and molecules absorbing light in a permanent electric field experiencing
quadratic Stark effect. In a magnetic field we have a wave packet that evolves
in time exactly as classical dipole oscillator in a permanent magnetic field.
In the second case we have the wave packet that goes through periodical changes

paper reports on the experimental realization of GHZ correlations using nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). The NMR experiment differs from the originally
proposed GHZ experiment in several ways: it is performed on mixed states rather
than pure states; and instead of being widely separated, the spins on which it
is performed are all located in the same molecule. As a result, the NMR version
of the GHZ experiment cannot entirely rule out classical local hidden
variables. It nonetheless provides an unambiguous demonstration of the
&quot;paradoxical&quot; GHZ correlations, and shows that any classical hidden variables
must communicate by non-standard and previously undetected forces. The NMR
demonstration of GHZ correlations shows the power of NMR quantum information
processing techniques for demonstrating fundamental effects in quantum

system consisting of $n$ free non-correlated quantum particles, solitonic
solutions to the nonlinear phase modification of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation
proposed recently. The non-separability manifests itself in the wave function
of a single particle being influenced by the very presence of other particles.
In the simplest case of identical particles, it is the number of particles that
affects the wave function of each particle and, in particular, the width of its
Gaussian probability density. As a result, this width, a local property, is
directly linked to the mass of the entire Universe in a very Machian manner. In
the realistic limit of large $n$ if the width in question is to be microscopic,
the coupling constant must be very small resulting in an ``almost linear''
theory. This provides a model explanation of why the linearity of quantum
mechanics can be accepted with such a high degree of certainty even if the more
fundamental underlying theory could be nonlinear. We also demonstrate that when
such non-correlated solitons are coupled to harmonic oscilators they lead to a
faster-than-light nonlocal telegraph since changing the frequency of one
oscillator affects instantaneously the probability density of particles
associated with other oscillators. This effect can be alleviated by fine-tuning
the parameters of the solution. Exclusion rules of a novel kind that we term
supersuperselection rules also emerge from these solutions. They are similar to
the mass and the univalence superselection rules in linear quantum mechanics.
The effects in question and the exclusion rules do not appear if a weakly
separable extension to $n$-particles is employed.

of short-distance structures, if described by linear operators: they can be
continuous, discrete or &quot;unsharp&quot; in one of two ways. In the literature,
various quantum gravity models of space-time at short distances point towards
one of these two types of unsharpness. Here, we investigate the properties of
fields over such unsharp coordinates. We find that these fields are continuous
- but possess only a finite density of degrees of freedom, similar to fields on
lattices. We observe that this type of unsharpness is technically the same as
the aperture induced unsharpness of optical images. It is also of the same type
as the unsharpness of the time-resolution of bandlimited electronic signals.
Indeed, as a special case we recover the Shannon sampling theorem of
information theory.

computer from decoherence due to a noisy environment. In this paper, we present
two methods for optimizing the physical implementation of such error correction
schemes. First, we discuss an optimal quantum circuit implementation of the
smallest error-correcting code (the three bit code). Quantum circuits are
physically implemented by serial pulses, i.e. by switching on and off external
parameters in the Hamiltonian one after another. In contrast to this, we
introduce a new parallel switching method that allows faster gate operation by
switching all external parameters simultaneously. These two methods are applied
to electron spins in coupled quantum dots subject to a Heisenberg coupling
H=J(t) S_1*S_2 which can generate the universal quantum gate
`square-root-of-swap'. Using parallel pulses, the encoding for three-bit
quantum error correction in a Heisenberg system can be accelerated by a factor
of about two. We point out that parallel switching has potential applications
for arbitrary quantum computer architectures.

reproduced by these examples. The key feature of the models is the role of
topology change. It is the breakdown of causal structure associated with
topology change that leads to the apparently non-classical behaviour. For
geons, topology change is required to describe the interaction of particles. It
is therefore natural to regard topology change as an essential part of the
measurement process. This leads to models in which the measurement imposes
additional non-redundant boundary conditions. The initial state cannot be
described independently of the measurement and there is a causal connection
between the measurement and the initial state.

theory of GRW (Ghirardi, Rimini, and Weber [1986]) can only solve the problem
of wavefunction tails at the expense of predicting that arithmetic does not
apply to ordinary macroscopic objects. More specifically, Lewis argues that the
GRW theory must violate the enumeration principle: that `if marble 1 is in the
box and marble 2 is in the box and so on through marble $n$, then all $n$
marbles are in the box' ([1997], p. 321). Ghirardi and Bassi ([1999]) have
replied that it is meaningless to say that the enumeration principle is
violated because the wavefunction Lewis uses to exhibit the violation cannot
persist, according to the GRW theory, for more than a split second ([1999], p.
709). On the contrary, we argue that Lewis's argument survives Ghirardi and
Bassi's criticism unscathed. We then go on to show that, while the enumeration
principle can fail in the GRW theory, the theory itself guarantees that the
principle can never be empirically falsified, leaving the applicability of
arithmetical reasoning to both micro- and macroscopic objects intact.

processes. For the correct reproduction of experimental results, it is further
essential that the distribution function $P(x)$ of the results of a position
measurement is identical with $|\Psi|^2$ of the wavefunction $\Psi$ of the

additional assumption, but can be derived strictly from the chaotic motion of a
single system during a sequence of measurements, providing a completely

electromagnetic field with dipole approximation is accomplished in the
Kramers-Henneberger frame. A prove that just odd harmonics appear in the
spectrum for a linear polarized laser field is given, assuming that the atomic
radius is much lesser than the free-electron quiver motion amplitude. Within
this approximation a perturbation series is obtained in the Keldysh parameter
giving a description of multiphoton processes in the tunneling regime. The
theory is applied to the case of hydrogen-like atoms: The spectrum of higher
order harmonics and the above-threshold ionization rate are derived. The
ionization rate computed in this way determines the amplitudes of the
harmonics. The wave function of the atom proves to be rigid with respect to the
perturbation so that the effect of the laser field on the Coulomb potential in
the computation of the probability amplitudes can be neglected as a first
approximation: This approximation improves as the ratio between the amplitude
of the quiver motion of the electron and the atom radius becomes larger. The
semiclassical description currently adopted for harmonic generation is so
rederived by solving perturbatively the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation.

high step potential in the context of the Dirac equation are discussed to
derive the 'paradox' first obtained by Klein. The explanation of this effect in
terms of electron-positron production is reassessed. It is shown that a
potential well or barrier in the Dirac equation can become supercritical and
emit positrons or electrons spontaneously if the potential is strong enough. If
the well or barrier is wide enough, a seemingly constant current is emitted.
This phenomenon is transient whereas the tunnelling first calculated by Klein
is time-independent. It is shown that tunnelling without exponential
suppression occurs when an electron is incident on a high barrier, even when
the barrier is not high enough to radiate. Klein tunnelling is therefore a
property of relativistic wave equations and is not necessarily connected to
particle emission. The Coulomb potential is investigated and it is shown that a
heavy nucleus of sufficiently large $Z$ will bind positrons. Correspondingly,
as $Z$ increases the Coulomb barrier should become increasingly transparent to
positrons. This is an example of Klein tunnelling. Phenomena akin to
supercritical positron emission may be studied experimentally in superfluid

V and W synchronously assume pure spectral states according to which member of

attributable to the effectively random distribution of initial phases.

dimensional harmonic chain considered as a closed quantum mechanical system. By
comparing the properties of a family of coarse-grained descriptions of the
chain, we conclude that local coarse-grainings in this family are more useful
for prediction than nonlocal ones. A quantum mechanical system exhibits
classical behavior when the probability is high for histories having the
correlations in time implied by classical deterministic laws. But approximate
classical determinism holds only for certain coarse-grainings and then only if
the initial state of the system is suitably restricted. Coarse-grainings by the
values of the hydrodynamic variables (integrals over suitable volumes of
densities of approximately conserved quantities) define the histories usually
used in classical physics. But what distinguishes this coarse-graining from
others? This paper approaches this question by analyzing a family of
coarse-grainings for the linear harmonic chain. At one extreme in the family
the chain is divided into local groups of $N$ atoms. At the other extreme the
$N$ atoms are distributed nonlocally over the whole chain. Each coarse-graining
follows the average (center of mass) positions of the groups and ignores the
``internal'' coordinates within each group, these constituting a different
environment for each coarse-graining. We conclude that noise, decoherence, and
computational complexity favor locality over nonlocality for deterministic
predictability.

the generating functional of a scalar field inside a leaky cavity. Provided the
source is confined to the cavity, one can first of all integrate out the fields
on the outside to obtain an effective action for the cavity alone.
Subsequently, one uses an expansion of the cavity field in terms of its
quasinormal modes (QNMs)-the exact, exponentially damped eigenstates of the
classical evolution operator, which previously have been shown to be complete
for a large class of models. Dissipation causes the effective cavity action to
be nondiagonal in the QNM basis. The inversion of this action matrix inherent
in the Gaussian path integral to obtain the generating functional is therefore
nontrivial, but can be accomplished by invoking a novel QNM sum rule. The
results are consistent with those obtained previously using canonical
quantization.

group characterized by $(j,{\mathsf s}=(m-i\Gamma/2)^{2})$ in which the Lorentz

the complex square mass $(m-i\Gamma/2)^{2}$ characterizing the representation
of the Poincar\'e semigroup is exactly the position ${\mathsf s}_R$ at which
the $S$-matrix has a simple pole. Wigner's representations $(j,m)$ are the
limit case of the complex representations for $\Gamma=0$. These representations
have generalized vectors (Gamow kets) which have, in addition to the $S$-matrix
pole at ${\mathsf s}=(m-i\Gamma/2)^{2}$, all the other properties that
heuristically the unstable states need to possess: a Breit-Wigner distribution
in invariant square mass and a lifetime $\tau=\frac{1}{\Gamma}$ defined by the
exactly exponential law for the decay probability ${\cal P}(t)$ and rate
$\dot{\cal P}(t)$ given by an exact Golden Rule which becomes Dirac's Golden

the related low lying excitation spectra are completely determined by the

arbitrary Riemannian monotone metric on the space of positive matrices resp.
nonsingular density matrices. Special interest is focused on the scalar
curvature due to its expected quantum statistical meaning. The scalar curvature
is explained in more detail for three examples, the Bures metric, the largest
monotone metric and the Kubo-Mori metric. In particular, we show an important
conjecture of Petz concerning the Kubo-Mori metric up to a formal proof of the
concavity of a certain function on R_+^3. This concavity seems to be
numerically evident. The conjecture of Petz asserts that the scalar curvature
of the Kubo-Mori metric increases if one goes to more mixed states.

quantum computation to a classical signal input by action potentials. The
computational output of an entangled state in a single neuron will be selected
in a network environment by &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; coupling with other

mechanical path integral formalism in static curved spacetimes endowed with
event-horizons. A toy model, the Gui spacetime, and the 2D and 4D Schwarzschild
black holes are considered. The role of the topology of the coordinates
configuration space is emphasised in this framework. To cover entirely the
above spacetimes with a single set of coordinates, tortoise coordinates are
extended to complex values. It is shown that the homotopic properties of the
complex tortoise configuration space imply the thermal behaviour of the
propagator in these spacetimes. The propagator is calculated when end points
are located in identical or distinct spacetime regions separated by one or
several event-horizons. Quantum evolution through the event-horizons is shown

introduction of constraints, a primary kinematical representation is derived in
the form of a reproducing kernel and its associated reproducing kernel Hilbert
space. Constraints are introduced following the projection operator method
which involves no gauge fixing, no complicated moduli space, nor any auxiliary

involves another reproducing kernel with which inner products are defined for
the physical Hilbert space and which is obtained through a reduction of the
original reproducing kernel. Several of the steps involved in this general

that, due to electron-electron interaction, the fidelity of the entangled

triplet states (antibunching). Within standard scattering theory, we find that
the Fano factor (noise-to-current ratio) for singlets is twice as large as for

  law of thermodynamics</title><description>  Quantum buoyancy has been proposed as the mechanism protecting the
generalized second law when an entropy--bearing object is slowly lowered
towards a black hole and then dropped in. We point out that the original
derivation of the buoyant force from a fluid picture of the acceleration
radiation is invalid unless the object is almost at the horizon, because
otherwise typical wavelengths in the radiation are larger than the object. The
buoyant force is here calculated from the diffractive scattering of waves off
the object, and found to be weaker than in the original theory. As a
consequence, the argument justifying the generalized second law from buoyancy
cannot be completed unless the optimal drop point is next to the horizon. The
universal bound on entropy is always a sufficient condition for operation of
the generalized second law, and can be derived from that law when the optimal
drop point is close to the horizon. We also compute the quantum buoyancy of an
elementary charged particle; it turns out to be negligible for energetic
considerations. Finally, we speculate on the significance of the absence from
the bound of any mention of the number of particle species in nature.

  In the hands of an eavesdropper -- a quantum memory is a powerful tool,
putting in question the security of quantum cryptography; Classical privacy
amplification techniques, used to prove security against less powerful
eavesdroppers, might not be effective when the eavesdropper can keep quantum
states for a long time. In this work we suggest a possible direction for
approaching this problem. We define strong attacks of this type, and show
security against them, suggesting that quantum cryptography is secure. We start
with a complete analysis regarding the information about a parity bit (since
parity bits are used for privacy amplification). We use the results regarding
the information on parity bits to prove security against very strong
eavesdropping attacks, which uses quantum memories and all classical data
(including error correction codes) to attack the final key directly.
  In the hands of the legitimate users, a quantum memory is also a useful tool.
We suggest a new type of quantum key distribution scheme where quantum memories
are used instead of quantum channels. This scheme is especially adequate for
networks of many users. The use of quantum memory also allows reducing the
error rate to improve large scale quantum cryptography, and to enable the
legitimate users to work with reasonable error rate.

probability distribution of the time of arrival to a detector in terms of the
absorption current density. We define coordinate measurement by an absorbing
wall in terms of 4 postulates. We postulate, among others, that a quantum
particle has a trajectory. In the resulting theory the quantum mechanical
collapse of the wave function is replaced with the usual collapse of the
probability distribution after observation. Two examples are presented, that of
the slit experiment and the slit experiment with absorbing boundaries to
measure time of arrival. A calculation is given of the two dimensional
probability density function of a free particle from the measurement of the
absorption current on two planes.

quantum state using Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs. This protocol employs
only local operations and classical communication between the N parties
(N-LOCC). In particular, we rely on quantum data compression and teleportation
to create the desired state. This protocol can be used to obtain upper bounds
for the bipartite entanglement of formation of an arbitrary N-partite pure

cryptographic quantum key distribution schemes. It is based usually on
single-photon polarization states. Unfortunately, the implemented ``qubits'' in
the usual weak pulse experiments are not true two-level systems, and quantum
key distribution based on these imperfect qubits is totally insecure in the
presence of high (realistic) loss rate. In this work, we investigate another
potential implementation: qubits generated using a process of parametric
downconversion. We find that, to first (two-photon) and second (four-photon)
order in the parametric downconversion small parameter, this implementation of
quantum key distribution is equivalent to the theoretical version.
  Once realistic measurements are taken into account, quantum key distribution
based on parametric downconversion suffers also from sensitivity to extremely
high (nonrealistic) losses. By choosing the small parameter of the process
according to the loss rates, both implementations of quantum key distribution
can in principle become secure against the attack studied in this paper.
However, adjusting the small parameter to the required levels seems to be
impractical in the weak pulse process. On the other hand, this can easily be
done in the parametric downconversion process, making it a much more promising
implementation.

the metric they define on the state space, to the extreme points of the state

that their domain of Lipschitz elements can be enlarged so as to form a dual
Banach space, which generalizes the situation for ordinary Lipschitz seminorms.
We give a characterization of the metrics on state spaces which come from
Lipschitz seminorms. The natural (broader) setting for these results is
provided by the ``function spaces'' of Kadison. A variety of methods for
constructing Lipschitz seminorms is indicated.

with the unitary-invariant geometry of Fubini and Study. According to the
principles of geometric quantum mechanics, the detailed physical
characteristics of a given quantum system can be represented by specific
geometrical features that are selected and preferentially identified in this
complex manifold. Here we construct a number of examples of such geometrical
features as they arise in the state spaces for spin-1/2, spin-1, and spin-3/2
systems, and for pairs of spin-1/2 systems. A study is undertaken on the
geometry of entangled states, and a natural measure is assigned to the degree
of entanglement of a given state for a general multi-particle system. The
properties of this measure are analysed for the entangled states of a pair of
spin-1/2 particles. With the specification of a quantum Hamiltonian, the
resulting Schrodinger trajectory induces a Killing field, which is quasiergodic
on a toroidal subspace of the energy surface. When the dynamical trajectory is
lifted orthogonally to Hilbert space, it induces a geometric phase shift on the
wave function. The uncertainty of an observable in a given state is the length
of the gradient vector of the level surface of the expectation of the
observable in that state, a fact that allows us to calculate higher order
corrections to the Heisenberg relations. A general mixed state is determined by
a probability density function on the state space, for which the associated
first moment is the density matrix. The advantage of a general state is in its
applicability in various attempts to go beyond the standard quantum theory.

classical gravity in D space-time dimensions yields a 2-dimensional phase space
of observables consisting of the Mass M (&gt;0) and a canonically conjugate
(Killing) time variable T. Imposing (mass-dependent) periodic boundary
conditions in time on the associated quantum mechanical plane waves which
represent the Schwarzschild system in the period just before or during the
formation of a black hole, yields an energy spectrum of the hole which realizes
the old Bekenstein postulate that the quanta of the horizon A_{D-2} are
multiples of a basic area quantum. In the present paper it is shown that the
phase space of such a Schwarzschild black hole in D space-time dimensions is
symplectomorphic to a symplectic manifold
 S={(phi in R mod 2 pi, p = A_{D-2} &gt;0)} with the symplectic form d phi wedge d
p. As the action of the group SO_+(1,2) on that manifold is transitive,
effective and Hamiltonian, it can be used for a group theoretical quantization
of the system. The area operator p for the horizon corresponds to the generator
of the compact subgroup SO(2) and becomes quantized accordingly: The positive
discrete series of the irreducible unitary representations of SO_+(1,2) yields
an (horizon) area spectrum proportional k+n, where k =1,2,... characterizes the
representation and n = 0,1,2,... the number of area quanta. If one employs the
unitary representations of the universal covering group of SO_+(1,2) the number
k can take any fixed positive real value (theta-parameter). The unitary
representations of the positive discrete series provide concrete Hilbert spaces
for quantum Schwarzschild black holes.

involves a change of the spin state of the system and the other does not. We
show that the phonon-absorption rate corresponding to the former channel (in
the paper designated as the second absorption channel) is finite at zero
temperature ($T$), whereas that corresponding to the latter (designated as the
first channel) vanishes for $T\to 0$. The long-wavelength limit, being the
special case of the first absorption channel, corresponds to sound (bulk and

classical force that acts on a test mass. This speed meter is based on two
microwave resonators (``dual resonators''), one of which couples evanescently
to the position of the test mass. The sloshing of the resulting signal between
the resonators, and a wise choice of where to place the resonators' output
waveguide, produce a signal in the waveguide that (for sufficiently low
frequencies) is proportional to the test-mass velocity (speed) rather than its
position. This permits the speed meter to achieve force-measurement
sensitivities better than the standard quantum limit (SQL), both when operating
in a narrow-band mode and a wide-band mode. A scrutiny of experimental issues
shows that it is feasible, with current technology, to construct a
demonstration speed meter that beats the wide-band SQL by a factor 2. A concept
is sketched for an adaptation of this speed meter to optical frequencies; this
adaptation forms the basis for a possible LIGO-III interferometer that could
beat the gravitational-wave standard quantum limit h_SQL, but perhaps only by a
factor 1/xi = h_SQL/h ~ 3 (constrained by losses in the optics) and at the
price of a very high circulating optical power --- larger by 1/xi^2 than that
required to reach the SQL.

equation of motion, where Liouville's theorem does not apply to the usual field

a classical configuration space, for which volume need not be conserved,
instead of the usual phase space, to which Liouville's theorem applies. The
creation operator for the quantized field satisfies the QSD equations, but the
annihilation operator does not satisfy the conjugate eqation. It appears only

share local hidden variables. Specifically, a communication of 2.19 bits is
sufficient on average for the classical teleportation of a qubit, when
restricted to von Neumann measurements. The generalization to
positive-operator-valued measurements is also discussed.

distributions P(x,t) of one-dimensional quantum particles, first discovered in
1995. For the case of an infinite square well potential, these patterns are
shown to have a detailed quantitative explanation in terms of a travelling-wave
decomposition of P(x,t). Each wave directly yields the time-averaged structure
of P(x,t) along the (quantised)spacetime direction in which the wave
propagates. The decomposition leads to new predictions of locations, widths
depths and shapes of carpet structures, and results are also applicable to
light diffracted by a periodic grating and to the quantum rotator. A simple
connection between the waves and the Wigner function of the initial state of
the particle is demonstrated, and some results for more general potentials are
given.

question is whether such dynamical processes are eventually also responsible
for at least some of the superselection rules which are usually presented as
fundamentally rooted in the kinematical structure of the theory (so called
`hard' superselection rules). With this question in mind, I re-investigate two
well known examples where superselection rules are usually argued to rigorously
exist within the given mathematical framework. These are (1) the Bargmann
superselection rule for the total mass in Galilei invariant quantum mechanics
and (2) the charge superselection rule in quantum electrodynamics. I argue
that, for various reasons, the kinematical arguments usually given are not
physically convincing unless they are based on an underlying dynamical process.

commonly used describes the gradual decoherence of the system due to the
measurement, we show that when taking into account the detector output, we get
the opposite effect: gradual purification of the density matrix. The
competition between purification due to measurement and decoherence due to

which couples the random evolution of the system density matrix and the
stochastic detector output. The gradual density matrix purification due to
continuous measurement may be verified experimentally using present-day

discrete quantum spectrum for black hole horizon area. It is also believed that
the huge degeneracy of these area levels corresponds to the notion of black
hole entropy. Starting from these two assumptions we here infer the algebra of
a Schwarzschild black hole's observables. This algebra then serves as
motivation for introducing in the system's Hamiltonian an interaction term. The
interaction contains the horizon area operator, which is a number operator, and
its canonical conjugate, the phase operator. The Hawking radiation from a
Schwarzschild black hole is seen to be a consequence of an area-phase
interaction. Using this interaction we have reproduced the semi-classical
result for the Hawking radiation power. Furthermore, we show that the initial
state of the black hole determines the nature of its development. Thus, a state
which is an area eigenstate describes a static eternal black hole, but a
coherent state describes a radiating black hole. Hence, it is the observer's
initial knowledge or uncertainty about the horizon area which determines the
evolution.

which depart from the ideal model of quantum computation. Although these
tradeoffs have allowed successful demonstration of certain quantum algorithms,
a crucial question is whether they fundamentally limit the computational
capacity of such machines. We study the limitations of a quantum computation
model in which only ensemble averages of measurement observables are
accessible. Furthermore, we stipulate that input qubits may only be prepared in
highly random, ``hot'' mixed states. In general, these limitations are believed
to dramatically detract from the computational power of the system. However, we
construct a class of algorithms for this limited model, which, surprisingly,
are polynomially equivalent to the ideal case. This class includes the well

time-convolutionless projection operator technique the quantum master equations
for pulsed and continuous wave (cw) atom lasers are derived. In the case of the
pulsed atom laser the power of the time-convolutionless projection operator
technique is demonstrated through comparison with the exact solution. It is
shown that in an intermediate coupling regime where the Born-Markov
approximation fails the results of this algorithm agree with the exact
solution. To study the dynamics of a continuous wave atom laser a pump
mechanism is included in the model. Whereas the pump mechanism is treated
within the Born-Markov approximation, the output coupling leads to
non-Markovian effects. The solution of the master equation resulting from the
time-convolutionless projection operator technique exhibits strong oscillations
in the occupation number of the Bose-Einstein condensate. These oscillations
are traced back to a quantum interference which is due to the non-Markovian
dynamics and which decays slowly in time as a result of the dispersion relation
for massive particles.

nonlocal effect. In this paper it is shown that teleportation is conceptually
independent of nonlocality. This is done by constructing a toy local theory in
which cloning is not possible (without a no-cloning theory teleportation makes
limited sense) but teleportation is. Teleportation in this local theory is
achieved in an analogous way to the way it is done with quantum theory. This

  ensembles of pure states</title><description>  A laser, be it an optical laser or an atom laser, is an open quantum system
that produces a coherent beam of bosons. Far above threshold, the stationary
state $\rho_{ss}$ of the laser mode is a mixture of coherent field states with
random phase, or, equivalently, a Poissonian mixture of number states. This
paper answers the question: can descriptions such as these, of $\rho_{ss}$ as a
stationary ensemble of pure states, be physically realized? An ensemble of pure
states for a particular system can be physically realized if, without changing
the dynamics of the system, an experimenter can (in principle) know at any time
that the system is in one of the pure-state members of the ensemble. Such
knowledge can be obtained by monitoring the baths to which the system is
coupled, provided that coupling is describable by a Markovian master equation.
Using a family of master equations for the (atom) laser, we solve for the
physically realizable (PR) ensembles. We find that for any finite self-energy
$\chi$ of the bosons in the laser mode, the coherent state ensemble is not PR;
the closest one can come to it is an ensemble of squeezed states. This is
particularly relevant for atom lasers, where the self-energy arising from
elastic collisions is expected to be large. By contrast, the number state
ensemble is always PR. As $\chi$ increases, the states in the PR ensemble
closest to the coherent state ensemble become increasingly squeezed.
Nevertheless, there are values of $\chi$ for which states with well-defined
coherent amplitudes are PR, even though the atom laser is not coherent (in the
sense of having a Bose-degenerate output). We discuss the physical significance
of this anomaly in terms of conditional coherence (conditional Bose
degeneracy).

computation can be made robust against errors and inaccuracies, when the error
rate, $\eta$, is smaller than a constant threshold, $\eta_c$. The result holds
for a very general, not necessarily probabilistic noise model, for quantum
particles with any number of states, and is also generalized to one dimensional
quantum computers with only nearest neighbor interactions. No measurements, or
classical operations, are required during the quantum computation. The
proceeding version was very succinct, and here we fill all the missing details,
and elaborate on many parts of the proof. In particular, we devote a section
for a discussion of universality issues and proofs that the sets of gates that
we use are universal. Another section is devoted to a rigorous proof that fault
tolerance can be achieved in the presence of general non probabilistic noise.
The systematic structure of the fault tolerant procedures for polynomial codes
is explained in length. The proof that the concatenation scheme works is
written in a clearer way. The paper also contains new and significantly simpler
proofs for most of the known results which we use. For example, we give a
simple proof that it suffices to correct bit and phase flips, we significantly
simplify Calderbank and Shor's original proof of the correctness of CSS codes.
We also give a simple proof of the fact that two-qubit gates are universal. The

purely heteronuclear spin systems. The implementation of a quantum logic gate
imposes certain constraints on the motion of those spins not directly involved
in that gate, the so-called &quot;spectator&quot; spins; they must be returned to their
initial states at the end of the sequence. As a result, a homonuclear spin
system where there is appreciable coupling between every pair of spins would
seem to require a refocusing scheme that doubles in complexity and duration for
every additional spectator spin. Fortunately, for the more realistic practical
case where long-range spin-spin couplings can be neglected, simpler refocusing
schemes can be devised where the overall duration of the sequence remains
constant and the number of soft pulses increases only linearly with the number
of spectator spins. These ideas are tested experimentally on a six qubit

must be available, even though the computation is, in fact, not run. We study
the possibilities and limitations of general protocols for the counterfactual
computation of decision problems (where the result r is either 0 or 1). If p(r)
denotes the probability of learning the result r ``for free'' in a protocol
then one might hope to design a protocol which simultaneously has large p(0)
and p(1). However we prove that p(0)+p(1) never exceeds 1 in any protocol and
we derive further constraints on p(0) and p(1) in terms of N, the number of
times that the computer is not run. In particular we show that any protocol
with p(0)+p(1)=1-epsilon must have N tending to infinity as epsilon tends to 0.
These general results are illustrated with some explicit protocols for
counterfactual computation. We show that &quot;interaction-free&quot; measurements can be
regarded as counterfactual computations, and our results then imply that N must
be large if the probability of interaction is to be close to zero. Finally, we
consider some ways in which our formulation of counterfactual computation can
be generalised.

time evolution of the two-qubit system. This points to the modeling of the
interaction Hamiltonian of the two-qubit system which would correspond to the
CNOT transformation; the analysis naturally generalizes to the Toffoli gate.
Despite nonuniqueness of the model of the interaction Hamiltonian, the analysis
distinguishes that the interaction Hamiltonian does not posses any global
(rotational) symmetry. This forces us to conclude that the direct
(non-mediated) interaction in the two-qubit system does not suffice for
implementing the CNOT gate. I.e., so as to be able succesfully to implement the
CNOT transformation, a mediator (i.e. an external physical system interacting
with both of the qubits) is required.

equations. The effect of collisions is represented by correlation functions
which are possible to calculate with the help of the finite temperature
Lindhard RPA expression. The presented results are applicable to finite
temperature response of interacting quantum systems if the quasiparticle or
mean field energy is parameterized within Skyrme - type of functionals
including density, current and energy dependencies which can be considered
alternatively as density functionals. By this way we allow to share
correlations between density functional and collisional dissipative
contributions appropriate for the special treatment. We present results for
collective modes like the plasmon in plasma systems and the giant resonance in
nuclei. The collisions lead in general to an enhanced damping of collective
modes. If the collision frequency is close to the frequency of the collective
mode, resonance occurs and the collective mode is enhanced showing a

quantum frequencies are 0.124, 32.6, and 227 Zhz, respectively. By explaining
how these particles acquire phase at different rates, we explain why these
particles have different masses. Any free particle spin 1/2 wave function is a
sum of plane waves with spin parallel to velocity. Each plane wave, a pair of
2-component rotation eigenvectors, can be associated with a 2x2 matrix
representation of rotations in a Euclidean space without disturbing the plane
wave's space-time properties. In a space with more than four dimensions, only
rotations in a 4d subspace can be represented. So far all is well known. Now
consider that unrepresented rotations do not have eigenvectors, do not make
plane waves, and do not contribute phase. The particles e, $\pi,$ and p are
assigned rotations in a 4d subspace of 16d, rotations in an 8d subspace of 12d,
and rotations in a 12d subspace of 12d, respectively. The electron 4d subspace,
assumed to be as likely to align with any one 4d subspace as with any other,
produces phase when aligned with the represented 4d subspace in 16d. Similarly,
we calculate the likelihood that a 4d subspace of the pion's 8d space aligns
with the represented 4d subspace in 12d. The represented 4d subspace is
contained in the proton's 12d space, so the proton always acquires phase. By
the relationship between mass and phase, the resulting particle phase ratios
are the particle mass ratios and these are coincident with the measured mass
ratios, within about one percent. 1999 PACS number(s): 03.65.Fd

Schroedinger chain (DNLS) and of Ablowitz-Ladik chain (AL) are studied. It is
shown that for $n$-sites the dynamical algebra of DNLS Hamilton operator is
given by the $su(n)$ algebra, while the respective symmetry for the AL case is
the quantum algebra su_q(n). The q-deformation of the dynamical symmetry in the
AL model is due to the non-canonical oscillator-like structure of the raising
and lowering operators at each site.
  Invariants of motions are found in terms of Casimir central elements of su(n)
and su_q(n) algebra generators, for the DNLS and QAL cases respectively.
Utilizing the representation theory of the symmetry algebras we specialize to
the $n=2$ quantum dimer case and formulate the eigenvalue problem of each dimer
as a non-linear (q)-spin model. Analytic investigations of the ensuing
three-term non-linear recurrence relations are carried out and the respective
orthonormal and complete eigenvector bases are determined.
  The quantum manifestation of the classical self-trapping in the QDNLS-dimer
and its absence in the QAL-dimer, is analysed by studying the asymptotic
attraction and repulsion respectively, of the energy levels versus the strength
of non-linearity. Our treatment predicts for the QDNLS-dimer, a
phase-transition like behaviour in the rate of change of the logarithm of
eigenenergy differences, for values of the non-linearity parameter near the
classical bifurcation point.

  Application to Molecular Mechanics</title><description>  This paper deals with a general method for the reduction of quantum systems
with symmetry. For a Riemannian manifold M admitting a compact Lie group G as
an isometry group, the quotient space Q = M/G is not a smooth manifold in
general but stratified into a collection of smooth manifolds of various
dimensions. If the action of the compact group G is free, M is made into a
principal fiber bundle with structure group G. In this case, reduced quantum
systems are set up as quantum systems on the associated vector bundles over Q =
M/G. This idea of reduction fails, if the action of G on M is not free.
However, the Peter-Weyl theorem works well for reducing quantum systems on M.
When applied to the space of wave functions on M, the Peter-Weyl theorem
provides the decomposition of the space of wave functions into spaces of
equivariant functions on M, which are interpreted as Hilbert spaces for reduced
quantum systems on Q. The concept of connection on a principal fiber bundle is
generalized to be defined well on the stratified manifold M. Then the reduced
Laplacian is well defined as a self-adjoint operator with the boundary
conditions on singular sets of lower dimensions. Application to quantum
molecular mechanics is also discussed in detail. In fact, the reduction of
quantum systems studied in this paper stems from molecular mechanics. If one
wishes to consider the molecule which is allowed to lie in a line when it is in
motion, the reduction method presented in this paper works well.

negative probabilities represent fundamental quantum mechanical correlations
between the measured variable and the variables affected by quantum noise.

that require verification. As such they can at most provide us with two
subjective choices for the meaning of 'counterfactual statements' in quantum
mechanics. We shall show that the word 'counterfactual' is in fact
inappropriate here and should be replaced by the word 'hypothetical'. Mermin's
choice imposes a strictly contextual meaning based upon an interpretation of
counterfactuality which he used to refute, without proof as we shall see,
Stapp's logical proof [3] of non-locality in quantum theory. In linguistic
theory both authors' choices of meaning: counterfactual versus hypothetical are
equally acceptable and therefore some of the issues they discussed lie outside
the domain of physics. The issues they discussed are further confused by the
fact that in his reply Stapp [2] seems to have adopted Mermin's counterfactual
interpretation against his own original [3] hypothetical interpretation. In the
rest of this paper we shall adopt the hypothetical sense of Stapp's original
statements but we modify his crucial statement LOC2 appropriately, then
following his argumentations, we shall show that there is no conflict between
relativity and quantum mechanics. We suggest that this should be the natural
(pragmatic) choice of meaning in defining the predictions of events in the
Hardy experiment.

coincides with the new quantum Kolmogorov complexity restricted to the

effectively approximated from above. With high probability a quantum object is
incompressible. There are two alternative approaches possible: to define the

nowhere interacted and whose paths nowhere crossed. The experiment puts
together two photons from two (non-maximal) singlet-like photon pairs and make
them interfere at an asymmetrical beam splitter. As a result one finds
polarization correlations between the other companion photons from the pairs
whose paths nowhere crossed each other even when no polarization measurements
have been carried out on the former photons. The latter set of photons that
nowhere interacted are therefore event-ready prepared by their pair-companion
photons. The result reveals nonlocality as a property of selection which can
even be a preselection. It also reveals that one can predict spin-correlated
behaviour of photons in space and at beam splitters by controlling a no-spin

indistinguishable paths. A canonical example of Bohr's complementarity
principle [1] is a two-path interferometer with an external detector coupled to
one of the paths. Then, interference between the two paths vanishes (i.e.
dephasing) if one is able to detect, even in principle, the path taken by the
particle. This type of which path (WP) experiment was already executed with
photons, cooled atoms, neutrons, solitons, and more recently with electrons in
a mesoscopic system [2]. In the latter experiment path determination was
provided by inducing a change in the current flowing through the detector. In
the present experiment we perform a more intriguing WP determination: only a
phase change is being induced in the detector while the current remains
unaffected. We show that such detector-interferometer interaction can be
understood both, from the WP information obtained by the detector, or
alternatively by understanding the disturbance in the interferometer caused by
the detector. Moreover, we address the subtle role of detector coherency and
point out difficulties in the intuitive interpretation of the experiment.

inside a magnetic trap with respect to spin flips, as a first step in our
efforts to understand the quantum-mechanics of magnetic traps. The 1D toy model
that was used in this study was physically unrealistic because the magnetic
field was not curl-free. Here, we study, both classically and
quantum-mechanically, the problem of a neutral particle with spin S, mass m and
magnetic moment mu, moving in 3D in an inhomogeneous magnetic field
corresponding to traps of the Ioffe-Pritchard, `clover-leaf' and `baseball'
type. Defining by omega_p, omega_z and omega_r the precessional, the axial and
the lateral vibrational frequencies, respectively, of the particle in the
adiabatic potential, we find classically the region in the $(\omega_{r}%
(omega_r -- omega_z) plane where the particle is trapped.
  Quantum-mechanically, we study the problem of a spin-one particle in the same
field. Treating omega_r / omega_p and omega_z / omega_p as small parameters for
the perturbation from the adiabatic Hamiltonian, we derive a closed-form
expression for the transition rate 1/T_{esc} of the particle from its trapped
ground-state. We find that in the extreme cases, the expression for 1/T_{esc}
is dominated by the largest of the two frequencies omega_r and omega_z.

values of the tangles satisfying the corresponding equality, one can find a
quantum state consistent with those values. Further exploration of this result

harmonic oscillator that describes a one-mode bosonic field. We connect the
quantum measurement of an observable of the field with the possibility of
amplifying the observable ideally through a quantum amplifier. The
``classical'' measurement corresponds to the joint measurement of the position
$q$ and momentum $p$ of the harmonic oscillator, with following evaluation of a
function $f$ of the outcome $\alpha=q+ip$. For the electromagnetic field the
joint measurement is achieved by a heterodyne detector. The quantum measurement
of an observable $\hat O$ is obtained by preamplifying the heterodyne detector
through an ideal amplifier of $\hat O$, and rescaling the outcome by the gain
$g$. We give a general criterion which states when this preamplified heterodyne
detection scheme approaches the ideal quantum measurement of $\hat O$ in the
limit of infinite gain. We show that this criterion is satisfied and the ideal
measurement is achieved for the case of the photon number operator and for the
quadrature. For both operators the method is robust to nonunit quantum
efficiency of the heterodyne detector. On the other hand, we show that the
preamplified heterodyne detection scheme does not work for arbitrary observable
of the field. As a counterexample, we prove that the simple quadratic function
of the field $\hat K=i(a^{\dag 2}-a^2)/2$ has no corresponding polynomial
function $f(\alpha,\bar \alpha)$---including the obvious choice
$f=\hbox{Im}(\alpha^2)$---that allows the measurement of $\hat K$ through the
preamplified heterodyne measurement scheme.

which are self-adjoint. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. This is
because, in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, an operator is not necessarily
self-adjoint even if its expectation values are real. Instead, the operator may
be merely symmetric. Such operators are not diagonalizable - and as a
consequence they describe real degrees of freedom which display a form of
&quot;unsharpness&quot; or &quot;fuzzyness&quot;. For example, there are indications that this type
of operators could arise with the description of space-time at the string or at
the Planck scale, where some form of unsharpness or fuzzyness has long been
conjectured.
  A priori, however, a potential problem with merely symmetric operators is the
fact that, unlike self-adjoint operators, they do not generate unitaries - at
least not straightforwardly. Here, we show for a large class of these operators
that they do generate unitaries in a well defined way, and that these operators
even generate the entire unitary group of the Hilbert space. This shows that
merely symmetric operators, in addition to describing unsharp physical
entities, may indeed also play a r{\^o}le in the generation of symmetries, e.g.
within a fundamental theory of quantum gravity.

temperature. Yet when the Schwarzschild black hole is treated as a canonical
ensemble three problems arise: incompatibility with the Hawking radiation,
divergence of the partition function, and a formally negative mean-square
fluctuation of the energy. We solve all three problems by considering the
Schwarzschild black hole as a grand canonical ensemble, with the Hamiltonian
(the ADM mass) and the horizon surface area, separately, as observable
parameters. The horizon area simulates the number of particles in statistical
mechanics since its spectrum is assumed to be discrete and equally spaced. We
obtain a logarithmic correction to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and a
Gaussian type distribution for the energy levels.

from the combined atom-cavity system in atomic beam cavity quantum
electrodynamics experiments. These multiphoton emissions from the cavity are
nearly simultaneous approximately on the cavity lifetime scale. We determine
the optimal time for the detection window of photon pairs in two-photon

will not be detected; if the window time is too long, too many nearly

measurement? We propose a model independent answer: the information obtained is
equal to the minimum entropy of the outputs of the measurement, where the
minimum is taken over all measurements which measure the same ``property'' of
the state. This minimization is necessary because the measurement outcomes can
be redundant, and this redundancy must be eliminated. We show that this minimum
entropy is less or equal than the von Neumann entropy of the unknown states.
That is a measurement can extract at most one meaningful bit from every qubit
carried by the unknown states.

vary at most as fast as its highest frequency component. This is in fact not
the case, as Aharonov, Berry and others drastically demonstrated with explicit
counter examples, so-called superoscillations. It has been claimed that even
the recording of an entire Beethoven symphony can occur as part of a signal
with 1Hz bandwidth. Bandlimited functions also occur as ultraviolet regularized
fields. Their superoscillations have been suggested, for example, to resolve
the transplanckian frequencies problem of black hole radiation.
  Here, we give an exact proof for generic superoscillations. Namely, we show
that for every fixed bandwidth there exist functions which pass through any
finite number of arbitrarily prespecified points. Further, we show that, in
spite of the presence of superoscillations, the behavior of bandlimited
functions can be characterized reliably, namely through an uncertainty
relation. This also generalizes to time-varying bandwidths. In QFT, we identify
the bandwidth as the in general spatially variable finite local density of
degrees of freedom of ultraviolet regularized fields.

spin-1/2 systems as an adequate model of quantum bit, a relation of the
algebras with quantum information science has physical reasons. But there are
simple mathematical properties of the algebras those also justifies such
applications.
  First, any complex Clifford algebra with 2n generators, Cl(2n,C), has
representation as algebra of all 2^n x 2^n complex matrices and so includes
unitary matrix of any quantum n-gate. An arbitrary element of whole algebra
corresponds to general form of linear complex transformation. The last property
is also useful because linear operators are not necessary should be unitary if
they used for description of restriction of some unitary operator to subspace.
  The second advantage is simple algebraic structure of Cl(2n) that can be
expressed via tenzor product of standard &quot;building units&quot; and similar with
behavior of composite quantum systems. The compact notation with 2n generators
also can be used in software for modeling of simple quantum circuits by modern
conventional computers.

treatment of spin from first principles is now employed to treat systems of
compounded angular momentum. A general treatment is first given, which is then
applied to the concrete cases of a spin-0 and a spin-1 system obtained by
adding the spins of two spin-1/2 systems. Thus the probability amplitudes for
measurements on the systems are derived, as well as the matrix vectors and
operators corresponding to the systems. The matrix operators and states
obtained are different from the standard forms and are much more generalized.
The new results are applied to the case of joint measurements on the subsystems
of such a system; this is a problem that has been made very topical by the high
level of interest in the foundations of quantum mechanics. As a consequence of
the insights arising from this treatment, we show that the Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients are amenable to generalization, and we give the generalized forms
for these cases.

intracavity photon numbers, and vanishes for large pumps. In the four-level

system driven by the occasional pair of correlated photons, or weakly squeezed
light. We find that we may have holes, or dips, in the spectrum of the
fluorescent and transmitted light. This occurs even in the strong-coupling
limit when we find holes in the vacuum-Rabi doublet. Also, spectra with a
sub-natural linewidth may occur. These effects disappear for larger driving
fields, unlike the spectral narrowing obtained in resonance fluorescence in a
squeezed vacuum; here it is important that the squeezing parameter $N$ tends to
zero so that the system interacts with only one correlated pair of photons at a
time. We show that a previous explanation for spectral narrowing and spectral
holes for incoherent scattering is not applicable in the present case, and
propose a new explanation. We attribute these anomalous effects to quantum
interference in the two-photon scattering of the system.

unitary transformations can be implemented efficiently by sequences of local

Depending on the dimension of the one-particle Hilbert space such a universal

von-Neumann entropy of the optimally entangled state differs from the one of
the maximally mixed two-particle state by one bit only.

corresponding complex oscillator, a frequency which now depends on the geometry
of the source of the gravitational field, a fact that is absent in the case of

stochastic pilot-wave model, introduced by Nelson [E. Nelson, Phys. Rev., 150,
1079 (1966)], with a dual guidance condition. Namely, in addition to the
stochastic guidance condition which describes how the wave controls the
particle (wave-to-particle guidance condition), we introduce another stochastic
guidance condition describing how the particle guides the wave
(particle-to-wave guidance condition). We therefore introduce an
action-reaction principle in the pilot-wave formulation of quantum mechanics.
The particle-to-wave guidance condition takes the form of spontaneous
transitions of the wavefunction that are Poisson distributed in time. The
wavefunction selected by the transition is influenced by its likelyhood with
respect to the particle position, as well as certain conservation constraints.
It is shown that the stochastic particle-to-wave guidance condition reproduces
certain aspects of the spontaneous localization model of Ghirardi, Rimini and
Weber [G. C. Ghirardi, A. Rimini and T. Weber, Phys. Rev. D, 34, 470 (1986)],
and of Milburn's intrinsic decoherence model [G. J. Milburn, Phys. Rev. A, 44,
5401 (1991)], while avoiding some of the difficulties associated with them. The
macroscopic limit of the dualist interpretation is analyzed for the case of a
free body. Possible improvements of this interpretation are discussed.

mass parameter $m_h$ in the range $6.40 \times 10^{-33}$ eV to $7.25 \times

matter) to critical density, $\O_0$, is in the range 0.58 to 0.15, and the age
$t_0$ of the universe is in the range $8.10 h^{-1}$ Gyr to $12.2 h^{-1}$ Gyr,

that genuine photon spin singlets are emitted in predetermined directions even

In the experiment, two photons from two such singlets interfere at a beam

whose paths nowhere crossed - exhibit a 100% correlation in polarization, even
when no polarization has been measured in the first two photons. The propsed

reflection and transmission coefficients can be found out using WKB
approximation method. But due to change of barrier height, reflection and
transmission coefficients should be changed from point to point. Here we show
the analytical expressions of the instantaneous reflection and transmission

call it as Instantaneous WKB method or IWKB method. Once we know the forward

calculating Eiconal. For the case of analytically complicated potential
corresponding differential equation seems to be unsolvable analytically. If the
potentials are well behaved then obviously these could be replaced by functions
of simple expression of same behaviour which can be integrated analytically and
the equation is now possible to solve analytically.

environment plays a crucial role in producing the correct classical limit in
the Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics is investigated, in the context of
a model of quantum Brownian motion. It is well known that one of the effects of
the interaction is to produce an extremely rapid approximate diagonalisation of
the reduced density matrix in the position representation. This effect is, by
itself, insufficient to produce generically quasi-classical behaviour of the
Bohmian trajectory. However, it is shown that, if the system particle is
initially in an approximate energy eigenstate, then there is a tendency for the
Bohmian trajectory to become approximately classical on a rather longer
time-scale. The relationship between this phenomenon and the behaviour of the
Wigner function post-decoherence (as analysed by Halliwell and Zoupas) is
discussed. It is also suggested that the phenomenon may be related to the
storage of information about the trajectory in the environment, and that it may
therefore be a general feature of every situation in which such environmental
monitoring occurs.

  Bounded, Self-Adjoint Time Operator Canonically Conjugate to a Hamiltonian
  with Non-empty Point Spectrum</title><description>  In single Hilbert space, Pauli's well-known theorem implies that the
existence of a self-adjoint time operator canonically conjugate to a given
Hamiltonian signifies that the time operator and the Hamiltonian possess
completely continuous spectra spanning the entire real line. Thus the
conclusion that there exists no self-adjoint time operator conjugate to a
semibounded or discrete Hamiltonian despite some well-known illustrative
counterexamples. In this paper we evaluate Pauli's theorem against the single
Hilbert space formulation of quantum mechanics, and consequently show the
consistency of assuming a bounded, self-adjoint time operator canonically
conjugate to a Hamiltonian with an unbounded, or semibounded, or finite point
spectrum. We point out Pauli's implicit assumptions and show that they are not
consistent in a single Hilbert space. We demonstrate our analysis by giving two
explicit examples. Moreover, we clarify issues sorrounding the different
solutions to the canonical commutation relations, and, consequently, expand the
class of acceptable canonical pairs beyond the solutions required by Pauli's
theorem.

incompatibility of the Hardy equations for this class of states physically
originates from the fact that the existence of quantum perfect correlations for
the three pairs of two-valued observables (D_11,D_21), (D_11,D_22) and
(D_12,D_21) [in the sense of having with certainty equal (different) readings
for a joint measurement of any one of the pairs (D_11,D_21), (D_11,D_22), and
(D_12,D_21)], necessarily entails perfect correlation for the pair of
observables (D_12,D_22) [in the sense of having with certainty equal
(different) readings for a joint measurement of the pair (D_12,D_22)]. Indeed,
the set of these four perfect correlations is found to satisfy the CHSH
inequality, and then no violations of local realism will arise for the
maximally entangled state as far as the four observables D_ij, i,j = 1,2, are
concerned. The connection between this fact and the impossibility for the
quantum mechanical predictions to give the maximum possible theoretical
violation of the CHSH inequality is pointed out. Moreover, it is generally
proved that the fulfillment of all the Hardy nonlocality conditions necessarily
entails a violation of the resulting CHSH inequality. The largest violation of
this latter inequality is determined.

theoretically. The resolvent method for the multi channel Kondo effect is
applied to the band structure of the kp perturbation hamiltonian in the limit
of the infinite onsite repulsion at the impurity site. We discuss the local

The density of states of localized electron has a singularity |omega|^1/2 which

temperature dependence of the electronic resistivity is predicted as T^1/2, and
the imaginary part of dynamical susceptibilities has the |omega|^1/2

  Characterization</title><description>  Coherence in an open quantum system is degraded through its interaction with
a bath. This decoherence can be avoided by restricting the dynamics of the
system to special decoherence-free subspaces. These subspaces are usually
constructed under the assumption of spatially symmetric system-bath coupling.
Here we show that decoherence-free subspaces may appear without spatial
symmetry. Instead, we consider a model of system-bath interactions in which to
first order only multiple-qubit coupling to the bath is present, with
single-qubit system-bath coupling absent. We derive necessary and sufficient

noise. When using qubits, a measure of quality of a code is the maximum number
of errors that it is able to correct. We show that a suitable notion of
``number of errors'' e makes sense for any system in the presence of arbitrary
environmental interactions. In fact, the notion is directly related to the
lowest order in time with which uncorrectable errors are introduced, and this
in turn is derived from a grading of the algebra generated by the interaction
operators. As a result, e-error-correcting codes are effective at protecting
quantum information without requiring the usual assumptions of independence and
lack of correlation. We prove the existence of large codes for both quantum and
classical information. By viewing error-correcting codes as subsystems, we
relate codes to irreducible representations of certain operator algebras and
show that noiseless subsystems are infinite-distance error-correcting codes. An
explicit example involving collective interactions is discussed.

(m) -partite quantum systems, we study exactly and asymptotically (in n)
reversible transformations among n'th tensor powers of such states (ie n copies
of the state shared among the same m parties) under local quantum operations
and classical communication (LOCC). With regard to exact transformations, we
show that two states whose 1-party entropies agree are either locally-unitarily
(LU) equivalent or else LOCC-incomparable. In particular we show that two
tripartite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states are LOCC-incomparable to
three bipartite Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states symmetrically shared among
the three parties. Asymptotic transformations result in a simpler
classification than exact transformations. We show that m-partite pure states
having an m-way Schmidt decomposition are simply parameterizable, with the
partial entropy across any nontrivial partition representing the number of
standard ``Cat'' states (|0^m&gt;+|1^m&gt;) asymptotically interconvertible to the
state in question. For general m-partite states, partial entropies across
different partitions need not be equal, and since partial entropies are
conserved by asymptotically reversible LOCC operations, a multicomponent
entanglement measure is needed, with each scalar component representing a
different kind of entanglement, not asymptotically interconvertible to the
other kinds. In particular the m=4 Cat state is not isentropic to, and
therefore not asymptotically interconvertible to, any combination of bipartite
and tripartite states shared among the four parties. Thus, although the m=4 cat
state can be prepared from bipartite EPR states, the preparation process is
necessarily irreversible, and remains so even asymptotically.

useful quantity which arises naturally in our discussion is the ``relative
Casimir energy&quot;, which we define for a configuration of disjoint conducting
boundaries of arbitrary shapes, as the difference of Casimir energies between
the given configuration and a configuration with the same boundaries infinitely
far apart. Using path integration techniques, we show that the relative Casimir
energy vanishes exponentially fast in temperature. This is consistent with a
simple physical argument based on Kirchhoff's law. As a result the ``relative
Casimir entropy&quot;, which we define in an obviously analogous manner, tends, in
the classical limit, to a finite asymptotic value which depends only on the
geometry of the boundaries. Thus the Casimir force between disjoint pieces of
the boundary, in the classical limit, is entropy driven and is governed by a
dimensionless number characterizing the geometry of the cavity. Contributions
to the Casimir thermodynamical quantities due to each individual connected
component of the boundary exhibit logarithmic deviations in temperature from
the behavior just described. These logarithmic deviations seem to arise due to
our difficulty to separate the Casimir energy (and the other thermodynamical
quantities) from the ``electromagnetic'' self-energy of each of the connected
components of the boundary in a well defined manner. Our approach to the
Casimir effect is not to impose sharp boundary conditions on the fluctuating
field, but rather take into consideration its interaction with the plasma of
``charge carriers'' in the boundary, with the plasma frequency playing the role
of a physical UV cutoff. This also allows us to analyze deviations from a
perfect conductor behavior.

perform, in repeating a fixed unitary transformation on the total system, an
arbitrary unitary transformation on an arbitrary data state, by including a
program as another part of the input state. We note that if such a UQTM really
exists, with the program state dependent on the data state, and if the
prescribed halting scheme is indeed valid, then there would be no entanglement
between the halt qubit and other qubits, as pointed out by Myers. If, however,
the program is required to be independent of the data, the concerned
entanglement appears, and is problematic no matter whether the halt qubit is
monitored or not. We also note that for a deterministic programmable quantum
gate array, as discussed by Nielson and Chuang, if the program is allowed to
depend on the data state, then its existence has not been ruled out. On the
other hand, if UQTM exists, it can be simulated by repeating the operation of a
fixed gate array. However, more importantly, we observe that it is actually
still open whether Deutsch's UQTM exists and whether a crucial concatenation
scheme, of which the halting scheme is a special case, is valid.

of view that distinguishes between the observable consequences and the
``symmetrization postulate''. In particular, we make a critical analysis of
concepts of particle identity, state distinguishability and permutation, and
particle ``labels''. We discuss how to construct unique state vectors and the
nature of the full state descriptions required for this -- in particular the
elimination of arbitrary $2\pi$ rotations on fermion spin quantization frames
and argue that the failure to do this renders the conventional symmetrization
postulate (and previous ``proofs'' of it) at best {\em incomplete}.
  We discuss particle permutation in a general way for any pairs of particles,
whether identical or not, and make an essential distinction between exchange
and pure permutation. We prove a revised symmetrization postulate that allows
us to construct state vectors that are naturally symmetric under pure
permutation, {\em for any spin}. The significance of particle labels (which, in
the exchange operation, are not permuted along with other variables) is then
that they stand in for any asymmetry (order dependence) that is present in the
full state descriptions necessary for unique state vectors but not explicit in
the regular state variables. {\em The exchange operation is then the physical
transformation that reverses any asymmetry implicit in the labels}.
  We point out a previously unremarked geometrical asymmetry between all pairs
of particles that is present whenever we choose a common frame of reference. We
compute the exchange phase for various state vectors using different spin
quantization frames, and prove the Pauli Exclusion Principle and its
generalization to arbitrary spin.

statistical model is defined. The parameters of the single experiments are
functions of a hyperparameter, which defines the state of the system. There is
a symmetry group acting on the hyperparameters, and for the induced action on
the parameters of the single experiment a simple consistency property is
assumed, called permissibility of the parametric function. The other
assumptions needed are rather weak. The derivation relies partly on quantum
logic, partly on a group representation of the hyperparameter group, where the
invariant spaces are shown to be in 1-1 correspondence with the equivalence
classes of permissible parametric functions. Planck's constant only plays a
role connected to generators of unitary group representations.

statistical experiments on the one hand and the foundation of quantum theory on
the other hand. The main aspects of this extension are: One assumes a
hyperparameter space $\Phi$ common to several potential experiments, and a
basic symmetry group G associated with this space. The parameter \theta_{a} of
a single experiment, looked upon as a parametric function $\theta_{a}(\cdot)$
on $\Phi$, is said to be permissible if G induces in a natural way a new group
on the image space of the function. If this is not the case, it is arranged for
by changing from G to a subgroup $G_{a}$. The Haar measure of this subgroup
(confined to the spectrum; see below) is the prefered prior when the parameter
is unknown. It is assumed that the hyperparameter itself can never be
estimated, only a set of parametric functions. Model reduction is made by
restricting the space of complex `wave' functions, also regarded as functions
on $\Phi$, to an irreducible invariant subspace $\mathcal{M}$ under G. The
spectrum of a parametric function is defined from natural group-theoretical and
statistical considerations. We establish that a unique operator can be
associated with every parametric functions $\theta_{a}(\cdot)$, and essentially
all of the ordinary quantum theory formalism can be retrieved from these and a
few related assumptions. In particular the concept of spectrum is consistent.
The scope of the theory is illustrated on the one hand by the example of a spin
1/2 particle and a related EPR discussion, on the other hand by a simple
macroscopic example.

non-relativistic matter. This metamorphosis of the equation of state can be
traced to nonperturbative vacuum effects that cause the scalar curvature to
remain nearly constant at a well-defined value after the transition, and is
responsible for the observed acceleration of the recent expansion of the
universe.

to a `shake up' of the phonon system and is dominated by a double-slit-like

elementary systems. Already the quantization of a particle on a circle shows
that the standard procedure has to be supplemented by an additional condition
on the admissibility of group actions. A systematic strategy for finding
admissible group actions for particular subbundles of cotangent spaces is
developed, two-dimensional prototypes of which are T^*R^+ and S^1 x R^+
(interpreted as restrictions of T^*R and T^*S^1 to positive coordinate and
momentum, respectively). In this framework (and under an additional, natural
condition) an SO_+(1,2)-action on S^1 x R^+ results as the unique admissible
group action.
  For symplectic manifolds which are (specific) parts of phase spaces with
known quantum theory a simple projection method of quantization is formulated.
For T^*R^+ and S^1 x R^+ equivalent results to those of more established (but
more involved) quantization schemes are obtained. The approach may be of
interest, e.g., in attempts to quantize gravity theories where demanding
nondegenerate metrics of a fixed signature imposes similar constraints.

that the reduced density matrix of the system-apparatus combine decoheres to a
statistical mixture where up and down spins eventually correlate with pointer
states of the apparatus. For the zero temperature bath these pointer states
turn out to be coherent states of the harmonic oscillator for arbitrary initial
states of the apparatus. For a high temperature bath pointer states are
Gaussian distributions (generalized coherent states). For both cases, the
off-diagonal elements in spin-space decohere over a time scale which goes
inversely as the square of the &quot;separation&quot; between the &quot;pointers&quot;. Our exact
results also demonstrate in an unambiguous way that the pointer states in this
measurement model emerge independent of the initial state of the apparatus.

  Systems</title><description>  Measurements are ordinarily described with respect to absolute &quot;Newtonian&quot;
time. In reality however, the switching-on of the measuring device at the
instance of the measurement requires a timing device. Hence the classical time
$t$ must be replaced by a suitable quantum time variable $\tau$ of a physical
clock. The main issue raised in this article is that while doing so, we can no
longer neglect the {\em back-reaction} due to the measurement on the clock.
This back-reaction yields a bound on the accuracy of the measurement. When this
bound is violated the result of a measurement is generally not an eigenvalue of
the observable, and furthermore, the state of the system after the measurement
is generally not a pure state. We argue that as a consequence, a sub-class of
observables in a closed system cannot be realized by a measurement.

  Collisions</title><description>  Photons emitted from the electromagnetic fields of relativistic heavy ions
can fluctuate into quark anti-quark pairs and scatter from a target nucleus,
emerging as vector mesons. These coherent interactions are identifiable by
final states consisting of the two nuclei and a vector meson with a small
transverse momentum. The emitters and targets can switch roles, and the two
possibilities are indistinguishable, so interference may occur. Vector mesons
are negative parity so the amplitudes have opposite signs. When the meson
transverse wavelength is larger than the impact parameter, the interference is
large and destructive.
  The short-lived vector mesons decay before amplitudes from the two sources
can overlap, and so cannot interfere directly. However, the decay products are
emitted in an entangled state, and the interference depends on observing the
complete final state. The non-local wave function is an example of the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.

when two different elementary fermions come together in the same space cell. At
this stage the model can explain the properties of the photon as a two-fermion
particle and it can be shown that the Dirac theory for relativistic fermions
could be deduced from this model. The model predicts that particles like the
electron or the quark are stable combinations of a large number of the
fundamental fermions, but proof of that prediction has not been given.

Oscillator. Our first results, focusing on circular wave packet motion have

This effect is washed out in the Foldy-Wouthuysen representation. Another

superconductors and estimate in one case and compute in another the rates at
which quantum information stored in these devices ``degrades'' because of
thermal fluctuations. In the case when the entire solid torus is
superconducting, the Boltzmann factor in the rate corresponds to a well-defined
critical fluctuation, and the rate is suppressed exponentially with the linear
size of the system. In the case when superconductivity is confined to the
surface of the torus, the rate is determined by diffusive motion of vortices
around the torus and does not depend exponentially on the linear size; we find,
however, that when the two dimensions of the torus are comparable the rate does
not contain the usual volume enhancement factor, i.e. it does not grow with the
total surface area of the sample. We describe a possible way to write to and
read from this quantum memory.

  Particle Problem</title><description>  The angle coordinate of the Quantum Kicked Rotator problem is treated as if
it were an extended coordinate. A new mechanism for destruction of coherence by
noise is analyzed using both heuristic and formal approach. Its effectiveness
constitutes a manifestation of long-range non-trivial dynamical correlations.
Perturbation theory fails to quantify certain aspects of this effect. In the
perturbative case, for sufficiently weak noise, the diffusion coefficient
${\cal D}$ is just proportional to the noise intensity $\nu$. It is predicted
that in some generic cases one may have a non-perturbative dependence ${\cal
D}\propto\nu^{\alpha}$ with $0.35 &lt; \alpha &lt; 0.38$ for arbitrarily weak noise.
This work has been found relevant to the recently studied ionization of H-atoms
by a microwave electric field in the presence of noise. Note added (a):
Borgonovi and Shepelyansky have adopted this idea of non-perturbative
transport, and have demonstrated that the same effect manifests itself in the
tight-binding Anderson model with the same exponent $\alpha$. Note added (b):
The recent interest in the work reported here comes from the experimental work
by the Austin group and by the Auckland group. In these experiment the QKP
model is realized literally. However, the novel effect of non-perturbative
transport, reported in this Letter, has not been tested yet.

provided by algebraic properties. This allows to calculate the Dirac matrixes
and to derive quantum mechanics equations from structure equations of the
specified algebras. A new interpretation of the wave function is given as
differential of the action vector. A generalization of the Dirac equation for
8-component wave function is derived. It is interpreted as the equation for two
leptons of the same generation. A procedure of the approximate description of
free leptons is formulated. The generalized equation of quantum mechanics is
reduced to the Dirac, Pauli and Schr\&quot;odinger equations by the sequential use
of this procedure. We explain the existence of three lepton generations.

This scheme leads to the first fault-tolerant realization of universal quantum
computation on DFSs with the properties that (i) only one- and two-qubit

Xia, C.Y. Ye, and S.Y. Zhu, Phys.
Rev. Lett. {\bf 77}, 1032 (1996)] that quantum interference between two
molecular transitions can lead to a suppression or enhancement of spontaneous
emission. This is manifested in the fluorescent intensity as a function of the
detuning of the driving field from the two-photon resonance condition. Here we
present a theory which explains the observed variation of the number of peaks
with the mutual polarization of the molecular transition dipole moments. Using
master equation techniques we calculate analytically as well as numerically the
steady-state fluorescence, and find that the number of peaks depends on the
excitation process. If the molecule is driven to the upper levels by a
two-photon process, the fluorescent intensity consists of two peaks regardless
of the mutual polarization of the transition dipole moments. If the excitation
process is composed of both a two-step one-photon process and a one-step,
two-photon process, then there are two peaks on transitions with parallel
dipole moments and three peaks on transitions with antiparallel dipole moments.
This latter case is in excellent agreement with the experiment.

dynamics of a system of D0-branes by applying the Wilson renormalization group
equation to the worldsheet partition function of a deformed sigma-model
describing the system, which includes the quantum recoil due to the exchange of
string states between the individual D-particles. We arrive at an effective
Fokker-Planck equation for the probability density with diffusion coefficient
determined by the total kinetic energy of the recoiling system. We use Galilean
invariance of the system to show that there are three possible solutions of the
associated non-linear Schroedinger equation depending on the strength of the
open string interactions among the D-particles. When the open string energies
are small compared to the total kinetic energy of the system, the solutions are
governed by freely-propagating solitary waves. When the string coupling
constant reaches a dynamically determined critical value, the system is
described by minimal uncertainty wavepackets which describe the smearing of the
D-particle coordinates due to the distortion of the surrounding spacetime from
the string interactions. For strong string interactions, bound state solutions
exist with effective mass determined by an energy-dependent shift of the static
BPS mass of the D0-branes.

involving three discrete states coupled to each other by two-photon processes
via a common continuum. This tripod linkage is an extension of the standard
laser-induced continuum structure (LICS) which involves two discrete states and
two lasers. We show that in the tripod scheme, there exist two population
trapping conditions; in some cases these conditions are easier to satisfy than
the single trapping condition in two-state LICS. Depending on the pulse timing,
various effects can be observed. We derive some basic properties of the tripod
scheme, such as the solution for coincident pulses, the behaviour of the system
in the adiabatic limit for delayed pulses, the conditions for no ionization and
for maximal ionization, and the optimal conditions for population transfer
between the discrete states via the continuum. In the case when one of the
discrete states is strongly coupled to the continuum, the population dynamics
reduces to a standard two-state LICS problem (involving the other two states)
with modified parameters; this provides the opportunity to customize the
parameters of a given two-state LICS system.

  Nonclassical but Classically Correlated</title><description>  Duan, Giedke, Cirac and Zoller (quant-ph/9908056) and, independently, Simon
(quant-ph/9909044) have recently found necessary and sufficient conditions for
the separability (classical correlation) of the Gaussian two-party (continuous
variable) states. Duan et al remark that their criterion is based on a &quot;much
stronger bound&quot; on the total variance of a pair of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-type
operators than is required simply by the uncertainty relation. Here, we seek to
formalize and test this particular assertion in both classical and
quantum-theoretic frameworks. We first attach to these states the classical a
priori probability (Jeffreys' prior), proportional to the volume element of the
Fisher information metric on the Riemannian manifold of Gaussian (quadrivariate
normal) probability distributions. Then, numerical evidence indicates that more
than ninety-nine percent of the Gaussian two-party states do, in fact, meet the
more stringent criterion for separability. We collaterally note that the prior
probability assigned to the classical states, that is those having positive
Glauber-Sudarshan P-representations, is less than one-thousandth of one
percent. We, then, seek to attach as a measure to the Gaussian two-party
states, the volume element of the associated (quantum-theoretic) Bures (minimal
monotone) metric. Our several extensive analyses, then, persistently yield
probabilities of separability and classicality that are, to very high orders of
accuracy, unity and zero, respectively, so the two apparently quite distinct
(classical and quantum-theoretic) forms of analysis are rather remarkably
consistent in their findings.

exact unperturbed solution, variational techniques represent the main tool for
any investigation of the eigenvalue problem of some semibounded operator H in
quantum theory. For a reasonable choice of the employed trial subspace of the
domain of H, the lowest eigenvalues of H usually can be located with acceptable
precision whereas the trial-subspace vectors corresponding to these eigenvalues
approximate, in general, the exact eigenstates of H with much less accuracy.
Accordingly, various measures for the accuracy of the approximate eigenstates
derived by variational techniques are scrutinized. In particular, the matrix
elements of the commutator of the operator H and (suitably chosen) different
operators, with respect to degenerate approximate eigenstates of H obtained by
some variational method, are proposed here as new criteria for the accuracy of
variational eigenstates. These considerations are applied to that Hamiltonian
the eigenvalue problem of which defines the &quot;spinless Salpeter equation.&quot; This
(bound-state) wave equation may be regarded as the most straightforward
relativistic generalization of the usual nonrelativistic Schroedinger
formalism, and is frequently used to describe, e.g., spin-averaged mass spectra
of bound states of quarks.

site can be measured using same-position first-order correlations. Statistics
of atomic distributions over the lattice can be measured via two-point
correlations, generally requiring the averaging of multiple realizations of
statistically similar but distinct realizations in order to obtain sufficient
signal to noise. Whereas two-point first order correlations are fragile due to
phase fluctuations from shot-to-shot in the ensemble, second order correlations
are robust. We perform numerical simulations to demonstrate these diagnostic

phase of fermion quantum waves cannot be found from these results. The
existence of a physical variable (the relative phase) which cannot be measured

States and ensembles</title><description>  In this sequence of papers, noncommutative analysis is used to give a
consistent axiomatic approach to a unified conceptual foundation of classical
and quantum physics.
  The present Part I defines the concepts of observables, states and ensembles,
clarifies the logical relations and operations for them, and shows how they
give rise to dynamics and probabilities.
  States are identified with maximal consistent sets of weak equalities in the
algebra of observables (instead of, as usual, with the rays in a Hilbert
space). This leads to a concise foundation of quantum mechanics, free of
undefined terms, separating in a clear way the deterministic and the stochastic
features of quantum physics.
  The traditional postulates of quantum mechanics are derived from
well-motivated axiomatic assumptions. No special quantum logic is needed to
handle the peculiarities of quantum mechanics. Foundational problems associated
with the measurement process, such as the reduction of the state vector,
disappear.
  The new interpretation of quantum mechanics contains `elements of physical
reality' without the need to introduce a classical framework with hidden
variables. In particular, one may talk about the state of the universe without
the need of an external observer and without the need to assume the existence
of multiple universes.

reviewed and contrasted with the standard Hilbert space (HS) theory of quantum

the conventional theory allows for the in-states $\phi^+$ and the out-states
(observables) $\psi^-$ of the S-matrix elements $(\psi^-,\phi^+)=(\psi^{out},S
\phi^{in})$ any elements of the HS $\H$, $\{\psi^-\}=\{\phi^+\}(=\H)$, the RHS
theory chooses the boundary conditions~:
$\phi^+\in\Phi_-\subset\H\subset\Phi_-^\times$, $\psi^-\in\Phi_+\subset
\H\subset \Phi_+^\times$, where $\Phi_-$ ($\Phi_+$) are Hardy class spaces
associated to the lower (upper) half-plane of the second sheet of the
analytically continued S-matrix. This can be phenomenologically justified by
causality. The two RHS's for states $\phi^+$ and observables $\psi^-$ provide
new vectors which are not in $\H$, e.g. the Dirac-Lippmann-Schwinger kets
$|E^{\pm}\in\Phi_{\mp}^{\times}$ (solutions of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation
with $\pm i\epsilon$ respectively) and the Gamow vectors
$|E_R-i\Gamma/2^\pm\in\Phi_{\mp}^\times$. The Gamow vectors $|E_R-i\Gamma/2^-$

interrogating photon is absorbed can in principle be arbitrarily small. We have
implemented this technique, demonstrating efficiencies exceeding the 50%
theoretical-maximum of the original ``interaction-free'' measurement proposal.
We have also predicted and experimentally verified a previously unsuspected
dependence on loss; efficiencies of up to 73% were observed and the feasibility
of efficiencies up to 85% was demonstrated.

  Antisymmetric Tensor of Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  We show that the recently formulated Equivalence Principle (EP) implies a
basic cocycle condition both in Euclidean and Minkowski spaces, which holds in
any dimension. This condition, that in one-dimension is sufficient to fix the
Schwarzian equation [6], implies a fundamental higher dimensional Moebius
invariance which in turn univocally fixes the quantum version of the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This holds also in the relativistic case, so that we
obtain both the time-dependent Schroedinger equation and the Klein-Gordon
equation in any dimension. We then show that the EP implies that masses are
related by maps induced by the coordinate transformations connecting different
physical systems. Furthermore, we show that the minimal coupling prescription,
and therefore gauge invariance, arises quite naturally in implementing the EP.
Finally, we show that there is an antisymmetric two-tensor which underlies
Quantum Mechanics and sheds new light on the nature of the Quantum
Hamilton-Jacobi equation.

Simultaneous measurement of four noncommuting spin components is shown to lead

The gauge field is defined through linear mappings in the generalized

particles in a gauge field are derived from the structure equations for the
action space expanded in the linear mappings of action vectors. In a special
case, these equations are reduced to the relativistic equations for the leptons

the set of equations includes the equation for the right neutrino interacting

change the position of a mirror, beam splitter, polarizer, state preparation,

quickly. In an interferometer a photon passes only one arm of the apparatus but
knows if the other arm is open or closed since the global pattern through which
it travels through contains this information and guides it appropriately. In a
polarization correlation experiment, two distant polarizers are part of the

An oracle for the unconstrained variant may be more powerful than quantum

scatterings of holes for incident electrons, and it also induces backward

  in the Lindblad theory of open quantum systems</title><description>  In the framework of the Lindblad theory for open quantum systems, expressions
for the density operator, von Neumann entropy and effective temperature of the
damped harmonic oscillator are obtained. The entropy for a state characterized
by a Wigner distribution function which is Gaussian in form is found to depend
only on the variance of the distribution function. We give a series of
inequalities, relating uncertainty to von Neumann entropy and linear entropy.
We analyze the conditions for purity of states and show that for a special
choice of the diffusion coefficients, the correlated coherent states (squeezed
coherent states) are the only states which remain pure all the time during the
evolution of the considered system. These states are also the most stable under
evolution in the presence of the environment and play an important role in the
description of environment induced decoherence.

vacuum, which is considered as a discrete (quantum) medium. The motion of the
particle is studied taking into account its interactions with the medium. It is
assumed that this interaction results in the appearance of special virtual
excitations, called &quot;inertons,&quot; in the vacuum medium in the surroundings of the
canonical particle. The solution of the equation of motion shows that a cloud
of inertons oscillates around the particle with amplitude $\Lambda=\lambda
v/c$, where $\lambda$ is the de Broglie wavelength, v is the initial velocity
of the particle, and c is the initial velocity of the inertons (velocity of
light). This oscillating nature of motion is also applied to the particle, and
the de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$ becomes the amplitude of spacial
oscillations. The oscillation frequency $\nu$ is given by the relation
$E=h\nu$. The connection of the present model with orthodox nonrelativistic
wave mechanics is analyzed.

(NPT), but for which we conjecture that no maximally entangled pure states in
$2\otimes 2$ can be distilled by local quantum operations and classical

result that, for certain states in this family, we cannot extract entanglement
from any arbitrarily large number of copies of $\rho_{bc}$ using a projection
on $2\otimes 2$. These states are canonical NPT states in the sense that any
bipartite mixed state in any dimension with NPT can be reduced by LQ+CC
operations to an NPT state of the $\rho_{bc}$ form. We show that the main
question about the distillability of mixed states can be formulated as an open
mathematical question about the properties of composed positive linear maps.

for robust, solid state implementation of such computers where the quantum
gates are sufficiently miniaturized to have nanometer-scale dimensions. Here I
present a new approach whereby a complete computer with nanoscale gates might
be self-assembled using chemical synthesis. Specifically, I demonstrate how to
self-assemble the fundamental unit of this quantum computer - a 2-qubit
universal quantum controlled-NOT gate - based on two exchange coupled
multilayered quantum dots. Then I show how these gates can be wired using
thiolated conjugated molecules as electrical connectors. A qubit is encoded in
the ground state of a quantum dot spin-split by the Rashba interaction.
Arbitrary qubit rotations are effected by bringing the spin splitting energy in
a target quantum dot in resonance with a global ac magnetic field by applying a
potential pulse of appropriate amplitude and duration to the dot. The
controlled dynamics of the 2-qubit controlled-NOT operation (XOR) can be
realized by exploiting the exchange coupling with the nearest neighboring dot.
A complete prescription for initialization of the computer and data
input/output operations is presented.

communication. We suggest that any quantum teleportation scheme can be
characterized by its efficiency, i.e. how often it succeeds to teleport, its
fidelity, i.e. how well the input state is reproduced at the output, and by its
insensitivity to cross talk, i.e. how well it rejects an input state that is
not intended to teleport. We discuss these criteria for the two teleportation
experiments of independent qubits which have been performed thus far. In the
first experiment (Nature {\bf 390},575 (1997)) where the qubit states were
various different polarization states of photons, the fidelity of teleportation
was as high as 0.80 $\pm$ 0.05 thus clearly surpassing the limit of 2/3 which
can, in principle, be obtained by a direct measurement on the qubit and
classical communication. This high fidelity is confirmed in our second
experiment (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 80}, 3891 (1998)), demonstrating entanglement
swapping, that is, realizing the teleportation of a qubit which itself is still
entangled to another one. This experiment is the only one up to date that

  Possible Applications to Quantum Computers</title><description>  In this article we continue our investigations of one particle quantum
scattering theory for Schroedinger operators on a set of connected (idealized
one-dimensional) wires forming a graph with an arbitrary number of open ends.
The Hamiltonian is given as minus the Laplace operator with suitable linear
boundary conditions at the vertices (the local Kirchhoff law). In ``Kirchhoff's
rule for quantum wires'' [J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 32, 595 - 630 (1999)] we
provided an explicit algebraic expression for the resulting (on-shell) S-matrix
in terms of the boundary conditions and the lengths of the internal lines and
we also proved its unitarity. Here we address the inverse problem in the
simplest context with one vertex only but with an arbitrary number of open
ends. We provide an explicit formula for the boundary conditions in terms of
the S-matrix at a fixed, prescribed energy. We show that any unitary $n\times
n$ matrix may be realized as the S-matrix at a given energy by choosing
appropriate (unique) boundary conditions. This might possibly be used for the
design of elementary gates in quantum computing. As an illustration we
calculate the boundary conditions associated to the unitary operators of some
elementary gates for quantum computers and raise the issue whether in general
the unitary operators associated to quantum gates should rather be viewed as
scattering operators instead of time evolution operators for a given time
associated to a quantum mechanical Hamiltonian.

systems S1, S2, relative to S2 and a set O of bounded observables of S2, is
introduced in the spirit of classical examples of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and
Bohm. We restrict ourselves mostly to EPR states of finite norm. The main
results are contained in Theorem 3,4,5,6 in section III and imply that if the
EPR states of finite norm relative to (S2, O) exist, then the elements of O
have discrete probability distributions and the Von Neuman algebra generated by
O is essentially inbeddable inside S1 by an antiunitary map. The EPR states
then correspond to the different imbeddings and certain additional parameters,
and are explicitely given by formulae which generalize the famous example of
Bohm. If O generates all bounded observables, S2 must be of finite dimension
and can be imbedded inside S1 by an antiunitary map, and the EPR states
relative to S2 are then in canonical bijection with the different imbeddings of
S2 inside S1; moreover they are given by formulae which are exactly those of
the generalized Bohm states. The notion of EPR states of infinite norm is also
explored and it is shown that the original state of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen can
be realized as a renormalized limit of EPR states of finite quantum systems
considered by Weyl, Schwinger and many others. Finally, a family of states of
infinite norm generalizing the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen example is explicitly
given.

is usually explained by decoherence, and viewed as a gradual process. The study
of entanglement, or quantum correlations, in noisy quantum computers implies
that in some cases the transition from quantum to classical is actually a phase
transition. We define the notion of entanglement length in $d$-dimensional
noisy quantum computers, and show that a phase transition in entanglement
occurs at a critical noise rate, where the entanglement length transforms from
infinite to finite. Above the critical noise rate, macroscopic classical
behavior is expected, whereas below the critical noise rate, subsystems which
are macroscopically distant one from another can be entangled.
  The macroscopic classical behavior in the super-critical phase is shown to
hold not only for quantum computers, but for any quantum system composed of
macroscopically many finite state particles, with local interactions and local
decoherence, subjected to some additional conditions.
 This phenomenon provides a possible explanation to the emergence of classical
behavior in such systems. A simple formula for an upper bound on the
entanglement length of any such system in the super-critical phase is given,
which can be tested experimentally.

stage in the early Universe have zero entropy as far as they reflect the time
evolution (squeezing) of a pure state, their large occupation number
notwithstanding. A non-zero entropy of the gravitons (classical gravitational
waves (GW) after decoherence) can be obtained through coarse graining. The
latter has to be physically justified {\it and} should not contradict
observational constraints. We propose two ways of coarse graining for which the
fixed temporal phase of each Fourier mode of the GW background still remains
observable: one based on quantum entanglement, and another one following from
the presence of a secondary GW background. The proposals are shown to be
mutually consistent. They lead to the result that the entropy of the primordial
GW background is significantly smaller than it was thought earlier. The
difference can be ascribed to the information about the regular (inflationary)
initial state of the Universe which is stored in this background and which
reveals itself, in particular, in the appearance of primordial peaks (acoustic

  Impossible</title><description>  In a secure bit commitment protocol involving only classical physics, A
commits either a 0 or a 1 to B. If quantum information is used in the protocol,
A may be able to commit a state of the form $\alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}$.
If so, she can also commit mixed states in which the committed bit is entangled
with other quantum states under her control. We introduce here a quantum
cryptographic primitive, {\it bit commitment with a certificate of
classicality} (BCCC), which differs from standard bit commitment in that it
guarantees that the committed state has a fixed classical value. We show that
no unconditionally secure BCCC protocol based on special relativity and quantum
theory exists. We also propose complete definitions of security for quantum and
relativistic bit commitment.

by the classical phase space. In this way we define the mean Wehrl entropy of

radiates its entire initial mass-energy. Thus there is no event horizon at any

states of the outcoming atoms. Inverted atoms enter stochastically, in general,
with a binomial distribution in discrete time; but we also consider the
continuous-time limit of this input statistics which is Poissonian. We envisage
two alternative experimental procedures: one of these is to consider a fixed
number N of atoms pumped into the cavity and subsequently leaving it to undergo
state detection; the other is to consider input of the excited atoms and their
subsequent detection and collection in a fixed time t. We consider, in
particular, the steady state behaviors achieved in the two limits, N -&gt;
infinity and t -&gt; infinity, as well as the approaches to these two limits.
Although these limits are the same for the state of the cavity field, they are
not the same, in general, for the observable outcoming atom statistics. We
evaluate, in particular, Mandel's Q-parameters $Q_{e}$ $(Q_{g})$ for outcoming
atoms detected in their excited states (ground states), for both N -&gt; infinity

marginal ranks, and distillability of a mixed state and use this to prove that
any rank n bound entangled state must have support on no more than an n \times
n Hilbert space. A direct consequence of this result is that there are no
bipartite bound entangled states of rank two. We also show that a separability

several input systems which have been subject to the same noise. The purity of
the outputs generally increases with the number of input systems, and decreases
with the number of required output systems. We construct the optimal quantum
operations for this task, and discuss their asymptotic behaviour as the number
of inputs goes to infinity. The rate at which output systems may be generated
depends crucially on the type of purity requirement. If one tests the purity of
the outputs systems one at a time, the rate is infinite: this fidelity may be
made to approach 1, while at the same time the number of outputs goes to
infinity arbitrarily fast. On the other hand, if one also requires the
correlations between outputs to decrease, the rate is zero: if fidelity with
the pure product state is to go to 1, the number of outputs per input goes to
zero. However, if only a fidelity close to 1 is required, the optimal purifier
achieves a positive rate, which we compute.

space-time structure of relativistic particles. The string is a limiting case
of a series of massive beads like a pearl necklace. In the limit of
infinite-number of zero-mass beads, it becomes a field-theoretic string.
Another interesting limit is to keep only two pearls by eliminating all others,
resulting in a harmonic oscillator. The basic strength of the oscillator model
is its mathematical simplicity. This encourages us to construct two-pearl
strings for a covariant picture of relativistic extended particles. We achieve
this goal by transforming the oscillator model of Feynman {\it et al.} into a
representation of the Poincar\'e group. We then construct representations of
the O(3)-like little group for those oscillator states, which dictates their
internal space-time symmetry of massive particles. This simple mathematical
procedure allows us to explain what we observe in the world in terms of the
fundamental space-time symmetries, and the built-in covariance of the model
allows us to use the physics in the rest frame in order to explain what happens
in the infinite-momentum frame. It is thus possible to calculate the parton
distribution within the proton moving light-like speed in terms of the quark
wave function in its rest frame.

in such a way that the von Neumann entropy S is increased, and dually, make all

entropy characterises the classical and quantum information capacities of the
ensemble and we argue that information capacity in turn, is a manifestation of
the distinguishability of the signal states. Hence our result shows that the
notion of distinguishability within an ensemble is a global property that

Hannay's angle turns out to be identical to that for the existence of a

sets of &quot;eigenfunctions&quot; are constructed, which depend on the way of choosing
classical solutions. For an eigenfunction, two different motions of the
probability distribution function (pulsation of the width and oscillation of
the center) contribute to the geometric phase which can be given in terms of
the parameters of classical solutions. The geometric phase for a general wave
function is also given. If a wave function has a parity under the inversion of
space coordinate, then the geometric phase can be defined under the evolution
of half of the period of classical motions. For the driven case, geometric
phases are given in terms of Fourier coefficients of the external force. The
oscillator systems whose classical equation of motion is Mathieu's equation are
perturbatively studied, and the first term of nonvanishing geometric phase is
calculated.

conditions, without requiring boundary conditions. Free particle states are
constructed using Dirac's delta function orthogonality conditions. The states
(doublets) depend on two quantum numbers: energy and parity. With the aid of
projection operators the particles are confined to a constrained region, in a
way similar to the action of an infinite well potential. From the resulting
overcomplete basis only the mutually orthogonal states are selected. Four
solutions are found, corresponding to different non-commuting Hamiltonians.
Their energy eigenstates are labeled with the main quantum number n and parity
&quot;+&quot; or &quot;-&quot;. The energy eigenvalues are functions of n only. The four cases
correspond to different boundary conditions: (I) the wave function vanishes on
the boundary, (II) the derivative of the wavefunction vanishes on the
boundary,(III) periodic (symmetric) boundary conditions, (IV) periodic
(antisymmetric)boundary conditions . Among the four cases, only solution (III)
forms a complete basis in the sense that any function in the constrained
region, can be expanded with it. By extending the boundaries of the constrained
region to infinity, only solution (III) converges uniformly to the free
particle states. Orthogonality seems to be a more basic requirement than
boundary conditions. By using projection operators, confinement of the particle
to a definite region can be achieved in a conceptually simple and unambiguous
way, and physical operators can be written so that they act only in the
confined region.

those satisfied by the Dirac delta function. The incomplete delta functions may
be employed advantageously in projected subspaces and in the link between
functions defined on the whole space and the projected subspace. We apply a
similar procedure to finite dimensional vector spaces for which we define
incomplete Kronecker deltas. Dispersion relations for the momenta are obtained
and ''sums over poles'' are defined and obtained with the aid of differences of

the Bures metrics over quantum systems might serve as prior distributions, in
analogy to the (classical) Bayesian role of the volume elements (&quot;Jeffreys'
priors&quot;) of Fisher information metrics. Continuing this work, we obtain exact
Bures probabilities that the members of certain low-dimensional subsets of the
fifteen-dimensional convex set of 4 x 4 density matrices are separable or
classically correlated. The main analytical tools employed are symbolic
integration and a formula of Dittmann (quant-ph/9908044) for Bures metric
tensors. This study complements an earlier one (quant-ph/9810026) in which
numerical (randomization) --- but not integration --- methods were used to
estimate Bures separability probabilities for unrestricted 4 x 4 or 6 x 6
density matrices. The exact values adduced here for pairs of quantum bits
(qubits), typically, well exceed the estimate (.1) there, but this disparity
may be attributable to our focus on special low-dimensional subsets. Quite
remarkably, for the q = 1 and q = 1/2 states inferred using the principle of
maximum nonadditive (Tsallis) entropy, the separability probabilities are both
equal to 2^{1/2} - 1. For the Werner qubit-qutrit and qutrit-qutrit states, the
probabilities are vanishingly small, while in the qubit-qubit case it is 1/4.

electric and magnetic charges are considered. Problem of interaction between
the associated soliton dyon solutions is investigated. For the case of
long-range interaction at first order by a small field of distant solitons we
obtain that the generalized Lorentz force is acted on a dyon under
consideration. Short-range interaction between two dyons having identical
electric and opposite magnetic charges is investigated for an initial
approximation. We consider the case when the velocities of the dyons have equal
modules and opposite directions on a common line. It is shown that the
associated field configuration has a constant full angular momentum which is
independent of the interdyonic distance and their speed. This property permits
a consideration of this bidyon configuration as an electromagnetic model of
charged particle with spin. We numerically investigate movement of the dyons in
this configuration for the case when the full electric charge equals the
electron charge and the full angular momentum equals the electron spin. It is
shown that for this case the absolute value of relation between electric and
magnetic charges of the dyons equals the fine structure constant. The
calculation gives that the bidyon may behave as nonlinear oscillator.
Associated dependence of frequency on the full energy is obtained for the
initial approximation. In the limits of the electrodynamic model we obtain that
the quick-oscillating wave packet may behave like massive gravitating particle
when it move in high background field. We discuss the possible electrodynamic
world with the oscillating bidyons as particles.

  computer?</title><description>  Highly excited many-particle states in quantum systems (nuclei, atoms,
quantum dots, spin systems, quantum computers) can be ``chaotic''
superpositions of mean-field basis states (Slater determinants, products of
spin or qubit states). This is a result of the very high energy level density
of many-body states which can be easily mixed by a residual interaction between
particles. We consider the time dynamics of wave functions and increase of
entropy in such chaotic systems.
 As an example we present the time evolution in a closed quantum computer. A
time scale for the entropy S(t) increase is t_c =t_0/(n log_2{n}), where t_0 is
the qubit ``lifetime'', n is the number of qubits, S(0)=0 and S(t_c)=1. At t &lt;&lt;
t_c the entropy is small: S= n t^2 J^2 log_2(1/t^2 J^2), where J is the
inter-qubit interaction strength. At t &gt; t_c the number of ``wrong'' states
increases exponentially as 2^{S(t)} . Therefore, t_c may be interpreted as a
maximal time for operation of a quantum computer, since at t &gt; t_c one has to
struggle against the second law of thermodynamics. At t &gt;&gt;t_c the system
entropy approaches that for chaotic eigenstates.

starting with a nonrelativistic free theory we obtain its minimal gauge
invariant extension by introducing two gauge fields with a Maxwellian self
interaction. We fix the gauge so that the residual symmetry group is the
Galilei group and construct a representation of the extended Galilei algebra.
The reduced N-particle Lagrangian describes geodesic motion in a
(N-1)-dimensional (Pseudo-) Riemannian space. The singularity of the metric for
negative gauge coupling leads in classical dynamics to the formation of
geometric bags in the case of two or three particles. The ordering problem
within the quantization scheme for $N$-particles is solved by canonical
quantization of a pseudoclassical Schroedinger theory obtained by adding to the
continuum generalization of the point-particle Lagrangian an appropriate
quantum correction. We solve the two-particle bound state problem for both
signs of the gauge coupling. At the end we speculate on the possible physical

through two uses of a noisy quantum channel, which is modeled by the action of
a completely positive trace-preserving (or stochastic) map. We provide strong
support for the conjecture that this minimal entropy is additive, namely that
the minimum entropy can be achieved when product states are transmitted.
Explicitly, we prove that for a tensor product of two unital stochastic maps on
qubit states, using an entanglement that involves only states which emerge with
minimal entropy cannot decrease the entropy below the minimum achievable using
product states. We give a separate argument, based on the geometry of the image
of the set of density matrices under stochastic maps, which suggests that the
minimal entropy conjecture holds for non-unital as well as for unital maps. We
also show that the maximal norm of the output states is multiplicative for most
product maps on $n$-qubit states, including all those for which at least one
map is unital.
  For the class of {\it unital} channels on ${\bf C}^2$, we show that
additivity of minimal entropy implies that the Holevo capacity of the channel
is {\it additive} over two inputs, achievable with orthogonal states, and equal
to the Shannon capacity. This implies that superadditivity of the capacity is
possible only for non-unital channels.

In particular, we focus on the splitting of the lowest singlet and triplet

relative energy scales of these states. We point out that at zero magnetic
field it is difficult to have both a vanishing double occupation probability
for a small error rate and a sizable exchange coupling for fast gating. On the

quantum computer operations with small errors. We critically discuss the

Such rules determine the timing of decoherence and the states in the mixture

But
suppose that at our disposal we have several copies of an unknown photon. Is it
possible to delete the information content of one or more of these photons by a
physical process? Specifically, if two photons are in the same initial
polarization state is there a mechanism that produces one photon in the same
initial state and the other in some standard polarization state. If this can be
done, then one would create a standard blank state onto which one could copy an
unknown state approximately, by deterministic cloning or exactly, by
probabilistic cloning. This might be useful in quantum computation, where one
could store some new information in an already computed state by deleting the
old information. Here we show that the linearity of quantum theory does not
allow us to delete a copy of an arbitrary quantum state perfectly. Though in a
classical computer information can be deleted against a copy, the same task
cannot be accomplished with quantum information.

because one must perform measurement to obtain information on a quantum system.
Among many possible limits of quantum measurement, the simplest ones were
derived directly from the uncertainty principles. However, such simple limits
are not the only limits. I here suggest a new limit which comes from the forms
and the strengths of the elementary interactions. Namely, there are only four
types of elementary interactions in nature; their forms are determined by the
gauge invariance (and symmetry breaking), and their coupling constants (in the
low-energy regime) have definite values. I point out that this leads to a new
fundamental limit of quantum measurements. Furthermore, this fundamental limit
imposes the fundamental limits of getting information on, preparing, and
controlling quantum systems.

short notes in 1923 and in a more complete form in his thesis defended in Paris
on the 25th November 1924. This result, recognised by the Nobel Prize in 1929,
gave rise to a major direction of &quot;new physics&quot; known today as &quot;quantum
mechanics&quot;. However, although such notions as &quot;de Broglie wavelength&quot; and
&quot;wave-particle duality&quot; form the basis of the standard quantum theory, it
actually only takes for granted (postulates) the formula for the particle
wavelength and totally ignores the underlying causal, realistic and physically
transparent picture of wave-particle dynamics outlined by Louis de Broglie in
his thesis and further considerably developed in his later works, in the form
of &quot;double solution&quot; and &quot;hidden thermodynamics&quot; theory. A price to pay for
such rough deviation from the original de Broglian realism and consistency
involves fundamental physics domination by purely abstract and mechanistically
simplified schemes of formal symbols and rules that have led to a deep
knowledge impasse justly described as &quot;the end of science&quot;. However, a new,

minimum r &gt; 0 such that P^r(y) = y (where P^r is P composed with itself r

from any x in {0,1,...,2^m - 1} and y in {0,1,...,2^n - 1} (where m is

queries. We show that the number of queries necessary to solve the problem in
the classical probabilistic bounded-error model is exponential in n. This
contrasts sharply with the quantum bounded-error model, where a constant number

process essentially affected by both the reversible dynamics leading to the
state before measurement, and the logical-mathematical constraints introduced
by quantum measurement (in particular, the constraint that there is only one
measurement outcome). This dual influence, originated by independent initial
and final conditions, justifies the quantum computation speed-up and is not
representable inside dynamics, namely as a one-way propagation. In this work,
we reformulate von Neumann's model of quantum measurement at the light of above
findings. We embed it in a broader representation based on the quantum logic
gate formalism and capable of describing the interplay between dynamical and
non-dynamical constraints. The two steps of the original model, namely (1)
dynamically reaching a complete entanglement between pointer and quantum object
and (2) enforcing the one-outcome-constraint, are unified and reversed. By
representing step (2) right from the start, the same dynamics of step (1)
yields a probability distribution of mutually exclusive measurement outcomes.
This appears to be a more accurate and complete representation of quantum
measurement. PACS: 03.67.-a, 03.67.Lx, 03.65.Bz

molecules. The artificial molecule consists of two coupled quantum dots stacked
along z direction and one single electron. One-qubit and two-qubit gates are
constructed by one molecule and two coupled molecules, respectively.The ground
state and the first excited state of the molecule are used to encode the |0&gt;
and |1&gt; states of a qubit. The qubit is manipulated by a resonant
electromagnetic wave that is applied directly to the qubit through a microstrip
line. The coupling between two qubits in a quantum controlled NOT gate is
switched on (off) by floating (grounding) the metal film electrodes. We study
the operations of the gates by using a box-shaped quantum dot model and
numerically solving a time-dependent Schridinger equation, and demonstrate that
the quantum gates can perform the quantum computation. The operating speed of
the gates is about one operation per 4ps. The reading operation of the output
of the quantum computer can be performed by detecting the polarization of the
qubits.

  Decoherent Histories Analysis</title><description>  The most general description of the classical world is in terms of local
densities (such as number, momentum, energy), and these typically evolve
according to evolution equations of hydrodynamic form. To explain the emergent
classicality of these variables from an underlying quantum theory, it is
therefore necessary to show, firstly, that these variables exhibit negligible
interference, and secondly, that the probabilities for histories of them are
peaked around hydrodynamic evolution. The implementation of this programme in
the context of the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory is
described. It is argued that, for a system of weakly interacting particles, the
eigenstates of local densities (averaged over a sufficiently large volume)
remain approximate eigenstates under time evolution. This is a consequence of
their close connection with the corresponding exactly conserved (and so exactly
decoherent) quantities. The subsequent derivation of hydrodynamic equations
from decoherent histories is discussed.

This complementarity is not a consequence of non-commutativity, rather it is

show that it is possible to write features of minimum size lambda/(2N) in an

simultaneously to any pair. However, we distinguish between simultaneous

various exchange asymmetries - including one which is anti-symmetric under
exchange of two bosons - all without violating the spin-statistics theorem. We

entangled systems assumes we have rotational invariance (RI), so that
coincidence rates depend on the difference only between detector settings, not
on the absolute values. Bell tests, as such, do not necessarily require RI, but
where it fails the presentation of results in the form of coincidence curves
can be grossly misleading. Even if the well-known detection loophole were
closed, the visibility of such curves would tell us nothing about the degree of
entanglement! The problem may be especially relevant to recent experiments
using &quot;degenerate type II parametric down-conversion&quot; sources. Logical analysis

new physics. The systems may be more nearly deterministic than quantum theory
implies. Whilst this may be to the advantage of those attempting to make use of
the so-called &quot;Bell correlations&quot; in computing, encryption, &quot;teleportation&quot;

and coherences between quantum subspaces, without a loss of coherence. This
results in a form of quantum error correction that is implemented by the joint
evolution of a system and a cold bath. It requires no external intervention
and, in principal, no ancilla. An example of a system that protects a qubit
against spin-flip errors is proposed. It consists of three spin 1/2 magnetic
particles and three modes of a resonator. The qubit is the triple quantum
coherence of the spins, and the photons act as ancilla.

near-perfect correlations of the photons allow the sharing of a secret key
between two parties. The presence of an eavesdropper is continually checked by
measuring Bell's inequalities. We investigated several possible eavesdropper
strategies, including pseudo-quantum non-demolition measurements. In all cases,
the eavesdropper's presence was readily apparent. We discuss a procedure to

at point X. We calculate P_{X}(T) for wave packets traveling through a

superconductivity. These objects, which carry rational or irrational quantum
numbers, are classified into universal classes $h$ of particles or
quasiparticles which obey specific fractal distribution function. We show that
the relaxation time associated to Hall conductivity for the superconducting
cuprate systems came to out as $\tau_{H}\propto T^{-2}$. We also consider the
pairing of fractons as a mechanism to produce bosonic systems and therefore
superconducting states. For that an effective mass obtained from the propagator
of a charge-flux system is considered. In this way, some experimental results
of infrared studies of the cuprates for the effective mass,
$m^*=m_{e}(1+\lambda)$, compared with our effective mass expression,
$m_{eff}=m(1+s)$, show us that the dominant factor for interactions came from
the spin. Thus spin flutuactions as a mechanism of high-$T_{c}$
superconductivity and fractons as quasiparticles are related. An expression to
the low temperature specific heat of a quantum liquid of fractons is also
obtained.

  systems</title><description>  The coherent information concept is used to analyze a variety of simple
quantum systems. Coherent information was calculated for the information decay
in a two-level atom in the presence of an external resonant field, for the
information exchange between two coupled two-level atoms, and for the
information transfer from a two-level atom to another atom and to a photon
field. The coherent information is shown to be equal to zero for all
full-measurement procedures, but it completely retains its original value for
quantum duplication. Transmission of information from one open subsystem to
another one in the entire closed system is analyzed to learn quantum
information about the forbidden atomic transition via a dipole active
transition of the same atom. It is argued that coherent information can be used
effectively to quantify the information channels in physical systems where
quantum coherence plays an important role.

that paradoxical phenomena in the microcosm give a possibility to demonstrate

scheme with hydrogen and helium nuclei is proposed. It is expected that the
results of these experiments will be considered as teleportation of nuclear
properties of atoms of the simplest chemical elements. A problem of
teleportation of the more palpable cargo is left to the physics of the more
