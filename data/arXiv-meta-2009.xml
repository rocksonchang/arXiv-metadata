a near-optimal strategy intentionally or unintentionally when the usual
Bennett-Brassard cryptographic scheme is performed between two trusted parties.
This phenomenon tends to disappear when eavesdropping strategy moves far from
the optimal one. Therefore, we conjecture that this resonant effect is a
characteristic for the eavesdropping strategy near to optimal one. We argue
that this effect makes the quantum cryptography more secure against the

teleportation and narrowband three-photon entanglement through interfering
narrowband photon sources. Since both the single-photon and the entangled
photon pair utilized are completely autonomous, it removes the requirement of
high demanding synchronization technique in long-distance quantum communication

physics audience to the recent results of Emile Grgin that unifies quantum
mechanics and relativity into the same mathematical structure. This structure
is the algebra of quantions, a non-division algebra that is the natural
framework for electroweak theory on curved space-time. Similar with
quaternions, quantions preserve the core features of associativity and complex
conjugation while giving up the unnecessarily historically biased property of
division. Lack of division makes possible structural unification with
relativity (one cannot upgrade the linear Minkowski space to a division algebra
due to null light-cone vectors) and demands an adjustment from Born's standard
interpretation of the wave function in terms of probability currents. This
paper is an overview to the theory of quantions, followed by discussions.

correlations. Here we quantify the relationship between tripartite entanglement
and the maximum expectation value of the Svetlichny operator (which is bounded
from above by the inequality) for the two inequivalent subclasses of pure

inequality. We further show that by design SI is more suitable as a measure of
genuine tripartite nonlocality between the three qubits in the the W-class
states, and the maximum is a certain function of the bipartite entanglement
(the concurrence) of the three reduced states, and only when their certain sum
attains a certain threshold value, they violate the inequality.

singled out of the many levels of an anharmonic oscillator. In these cases,
simple qubit control fails on short time scales because of coupling to leakage
levels. We provide an easy to implement analytic formula that inhibits this
leakage from any single-control analog or pixelated pulse. It is based on
adding a second control that is proportional to the time-derivative of the
first. For realistic parameters of superconducting qubits, this strategy
reduces the error by an order of magnitude relative to the state of the art,
all based on smooth and feasible pulse shapes. These results show that even
weak anharmonicity is sufficient and in general not a limiting factor for
implementing quantum gates.

properties has been started. The present paper concludes the project by turning
to classical mechanics. The quantum states that maximize entropy for given
averages and variances of coordinates and momenta are called ME packets. They
generalize the Gaussian wave packets. A non-trivial extension of the
partition-function method of probability calculus to quantum mechanics is
given. Non-commutativity of quantum variables limits its usefulness. Still, the
general form of the state operators of ME packets is obtained with its help.
The diagonal representation of the operators is found. A general way of
calculating averages that can replace the partition function method is
described. Classical mechanics is reinterpreted as a statistical theory.
Classical trajectories are replaced by classical ME packets. Quantum states
approximate classical ones if the product of the coordinate and momentum
variances is much larger than Planck constant. Thus, ME packets with large
variances follow their classical counterparts better than Gaussian wave
packets.

negative refraction at dipole densities which are considerably smaller than
necessary to achieve a negative permeability. At the same time the absorption
gets minimized due to destructive quantum interference and the ratio of
negative refraction index to absorption becomes orders of magnitude larger than
in systems without coherent cross-coupling. The proposed scheme allows for a
fine-tuning of the refractive index. We derive a generalized expression for the

  of frameness</title><description>  In the absence of a reference frame for transformations associated with a
group G, any quantum state that is non-invariant under the action of G may
serve as a token of the missing reference frame. We here introduce a novel
measure of the quality of such a token: the relative entropy of frameness. This
is defined as the relative entropy distance between the state of interest and
the nearest G-invariant state. Unlike the relative entropy of entanglement,
this quantity is straightforward to calculate and we find it to be precisely
equal to the G-asymmetry, a measure of frameness introduced by Vaccaro et al.
It is shown to provide an upper bound on the mutual information between the
group element encoded into the token and the group element that may be
extracted from it by measurement. In this sense, it quantifies the extent to
which the token successfully simulates a full reference frame. We also show,
that despite a suggestive analogy from entanglement theory, the regularized
relative entropy of frameness is zero and therefore does not quantify the rate
of interconversion between the token and some standard form of quantum
reference frame. Finally, we show how these investigations yield a novel
approach to bounding the relative entropy of entanglement.

measurement and the extent to which the measurement process is, in principle,
reversible. The greater the information that is gained, the less reversible the
measurement dynamics become. To illustrate this relation, we develop a simple
physical model for quantum measurement, as well as a hypothetical scheme by
which the experimenters can determine the reliability and reversibility. We
derive an &quot;uncertainty&quot; (constraining) relation between reliability and

Basing on the proposal provided in the SR interpretation of quantum mechanics,

  problem</title><description>  The cosmological constant problem is principally concerned with trying to
understand how the zero-point energy of quantum fields contributes to gravity.
Here we take the approach that by addressing a fundamental unresolved issue in
quantum theory we can gain a better understanding of the problem. Our starting
point is the observation that the notion of classical time is external to
quantum mechanics. Hence there must exist an equivalent reformulation of
quantum mechanics which does not refer to an external classical time. Such a
reformulation is a limiting case of a more general quantum theory which becomes
nonlinear on the Planck mass/energy scale. The nonlinearity gives rise to a
quantum-classical duality which maps a `strongly quantum, weakly gravitational'
dynamics to a `weakly quantum, strongly gravitational' dynamics. This duality
predicts the existence of a tiny nonzero cosmological constant of the order of
the square of the Hubble constant, which could be a possible source for the
observed cosmic acceleration. Such a nonlinearity could also be responsible for
the collapse of the wave-function during a quantum measurement. We conclude by
suggesting that the idea for the origin of dark energy proposed in this paper
can be tested indirectly in the laboratory by a detailed examination of the
process of quantum measurement.

pendulum is almost independent of the amplitude. However, such a pendulum is
damped by air friction. The latter may be viewed as resulting from air
molecules getting in contact with the pendulum. It follows that air friction,
not only damps the oscillation, but also introduces randomness. In the
so-called ``grand-mother'' clock, discovered by Huygens in the 18th century,
damping is compensated for, on the average, by an escapement mechanism driven
by a falling weight. The purpose of this paper is to show that such a clock is,
in its idealized form, a quiet oscillator. By ``quiet'' we mean that in spite
of the randomness introduced by damping, the dissipated power (viewed as the
oscillator output) does not fluctuate slowly. Comparison is made with quiet
laser oscillators discovered theoretically in 1984. Because the input power
does not fluctuate in both the mechanical oscillator and the quiet laser
oscillator, the output power does not fluctuate at small Fourier frequencies,
irrespectively of the detailed mechanisms involved.

theory, involving Wigner's 3nj symbols, as well as the related problems of
their calculations, general properties, asymptotic limits for large entries,
play nowadays a prominent role also in quantum gravity and quantum computing
applications. We refer to the ingredients of this theory -and of its extension
to other Lie and quantum group- by using the collective term of `spin

connections with the mathematical theory of discrete orthogonal polynomials
(the so-called Askey Scheme), providing powerful tools based on asymptotic
expansions, which correspond on the physical side to various levels of
semi-classical limits. These results are useful not only in theoretical
molecular physics but also in motivating algorithms for the computationally
demanding problems of molecular dynamics and chemical reaction theory, where
large angular momenta are typically involved. As for quantum chemistry,
applications of these techniques include selection and classification of
complete orthogonal basis sets in atomic and molecular problems, either in
configuration space (Sturmian orbitals) or in momentum space. In this paper we
list and discuss some aspects of these developments -such as for instance the
hyperquantization algorithm- as well as a few applications to quantum gravity

Moreover, for any state in the ground space of H_n and any m, there are regions

experiment. It amounts to transform a classical fluid into a quantum-type fluid
by the application of a quantum-like potential, either directly in a stationary
configuration, or through a retro-active loop to simulate the time evolution.
In this framework, the amplitude of the quantum potential depends on a
macroscopic generalization of the Planck constant, which can be changed during
the experiment, therefore simulating a quantum to classical transition. The
experiment is exemplified here by an application of this concept to gravity
waves at the surface of an incompressible liquid in a basin of finite height,
with particular emphasis on the quantized vortex. We construct a complex wave
function with the height of the fluid in the basin as its square modulus and
the velocity potential as its phase. This wave function is solution of a
nonlinear Schrodinger equation typical of superfluids. The quantum potential is
therefore defined here in terms of the square root of the fluid height. We
suggest two methods for applying this quantum-like potential to the fluid: (i)
by the action of a force on the surface (wind, blower, pressure, field,
etc...); (ii) by a curvature of the basin ground. In this last case the ground
profile yields the quantum potential itself, while usually only the quantum
force is accessible, so that such an experiment is expected to provide one with
a macroscopic model of a quantum-type vacuum energy. These results may also be
relevant to the study of freak waves, which have already been described by
nonlinear Schrodinger equations.

  We develop a probability calculus based on these more general distributions
that includes definitions of joints, conditionals and formulas that relate
these, including analogs of the Theorem of Total Probability and various Bayes
rules for the calculation of posterior density matrices. The resulting calculus
parallels the familiar &quot;conventional&quot; probability calculus and always retains
the latter as a special case when all matrices are diagonal. We motivate both
the conventional and the generalized Bayes rule with a minimum relative entropy
principle, where the Kullbach-Leibler version gives the conventional Bayes rule
and Umegaki's quantum relative entropy the new Bayes rule for density matrices.
  Whereas the conventional Bayesian methods maintain uncertainty about which
model has the highest data likelihood, the generalization maintains uncertainty
about which unit direction has the largest variance. Surprisingly the bounds
also generalize: as in the conventional setting we upper bound the negative log
likelihood of the data by the negative log likelihood of the MAP estimator.

Hamiltonians exhibiting non-abelian anyonic excitations. At the core of our
construction is a perturbative analysis of a widely used hopping-term
Hamiltonian. We show that in the low-energy limit, this Hamiltonian can be
approximated by a certain ordered product of operators. In particular, this
provides a simplified realization of Kitaev's quantum double Hamiltonians.

shift in position space which entangles the coin and position degrees of
freedom of the walker. After several steps, the coin-position entanglement
(CPE) converges to a well defined value which depends on the initial state. In
this work we provide an analytical method which allows for the exact
calculation of the asymptotic reduced density operator and the corresponding
CPE for a discrete-time quantum walk on a two-dimensional lattice. We use the
von Neumann entropy of the reduced density operator as an entanglement measure.
The method is applied to the case of a Hadamard walk for which the dependence
of the resulting CPE on initial conditions is obtained. Initial states leading
to maximum or minimum CPE are identified and the relation between the coin or
position entanglement present in the initial state of the walker and the final
level of CPE is discussed. The CPE obtained from separable initial states
satisfies an additivity property in terms of CPE of the corresponding
one-dimensional cases. Non-local initial conditions are also considered and we
find that the extreme case of an initial uniform position distribution leads to
the largest CPE variation.

  oscillator close to the quantum limit</title><description>  The observation of quantum phenomena in macroscopic mechanical oscillators
has been a subject of interest since the inception of quantum mechanics.
Prerequisite to this regime are both preparation of the mechanical oscillator
at low phonon occupancy and a measurement sensitivity at the scale of the
spread of the oscillator's ground state wavefunction. It has been widely
perceived that the most promising approach to address these two challenges are
electro nanomechanical systems. Here we approach for the first time the quantum
regime with a mechanical oscillator of mesoscopic dimensions--discernible to
the bare eye--and 1000-times more massive than the heaviest nano-mechanical
oscillators used to date. Imperative to these advances are two key principles
of cavity optomechanics: Optical interferometric measurement of mechanical
displacement at the attometer level, and the ability to use measurement induced
dynamic back-action to achieve resolved sideband laser cooling of the
mechanical degree of freedom. Using only modest cryogenic pre-cooling to 1.65
K, preparation of a mechanical oscillator close to its quantum ground state
(63+-20 phonons) is demonstrated. Simultaneously, a readout sensitivity that is
within a factor of 5.5+-1.5 of the standard quantum limit is achieved. The
reported experiments mark a paradigm shift in the approach to the quantum limit
of mechanical oscillators using optical techniques and represent a first step
into a new era of experimental investigation which probes the quantum nature of
the most tangible harmonic oscillator: a mechanical vibration.

($h(t)$) which varies sinusoidally with time as $h = h_0\cos{\omega t}$, with
$|t| \leq t_f = \pi/\omega$. We also consider the situation where the magnetic
field consists of an oscillatory as well as a linearly varying component, i.e.,
$h(t) = h_0\cos{\omega t} + t/\tau$. Our purpose is to estimate the defect
density and the local entropy density in the final state if the system is
initially prepared in its ground state. For a single crossing through the
quantum critical point with $h = h_0\cos{\omega t}$, the density of defects in
the final state is calculated by mapping the dynamics to an equivalent Landau
Zener problem by linearizing near the crossing point, and is found to vary as
$\sqrt{\omega}$ in the limit of small $\omega$. On the other hand, the local
entropy density is found to attain a maximum as a function of $\omega$ near a
characteristic scale $\omega_0$. Extending to the situation of multiple
crossings, we show that the non-trivial interference effects of certain
resonance modes solely contribute to the production of defects. Kink density as
well as the diagonal entropy density show oscillatory dependence on the number
of full cycles of oscillation. Finally, the inclusion of a linear term in the
transverse field on top of the oscillatory component, results to a kink density
which decreases continuously with $\tau$ and $\omega$. The entropy density
shows monotonous growth with both $\tau$ and $\omega$, in sharp contrast to the
situations studied earlier. We do also propose appropriate scaling relations
for the defect density in above situations and compare the results with the

better off over the classical players. It is also seen that the game's Nash

of bright and dark periods in the entanglement dynamics of two qubits subject

been considered in the last few years in the framework of quantum computation.
We show how the theory of CMV matrices gives a natural tool to study these
processes and to give results that are analogous to those that Karlin and
McGregor developed to study (classical) birth-and-death processes using
orthogonal polynomials on the real line. In perfect analogy with the classical
case the study of QRWs on the set of non-negative integers can be handled using
scalar valued (Laurent) polynomials and a scalar valued measure on the circle.
In the case of classical or quantum random walks on the integers one needs to
allow for matrix valued versions of these notions. We show how our tools yield
results in the well known case of the Hadamard walk, but we go beyond this
translation invariant model to analyze examples that are hard to analyze using
other methods. More precisely we consider QRWs on the set of non- negative
integers. The analysis of these cases leads to phenomena that are absent in the
case of QRWs on the integers even if one restricts oneself to a constant coin.
This is illustrated here by studying recurrence properties of the walk, but the
same method can be used for other purposes. The presentation here aims at being
selfcontained, but we re- frain from trying to give an introduction to quantum
random walks, a subject well surveyed in the literature we quote. For two

  analogies and differences at zero magnetic field</title><description>  We investigate the way that the degenerate manifold of midgap edge states in
quasicircular graphene quantum dots with zig-zag boundaries supports, under
free-magnetic-field conditions, strongly correlated many-body behavior
analogous to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), familiar from the case
of semiconductor heterostructures in high magnetic fields. Systematic
exact-diagonalization (EXD) numerical studies are presented for the first time
for 5 &lt;= N &lt;= 8 fully spin-polarized electrons and for total angular momenta in
the range of N(N-1)/2 &lt;= L &lt;= 150. We present a derivation of a
rotating-electron-molecule (REM) type wave function based on the methodology
introduced earlier [C. Yannouleas and U. Landman, Phys. Rev. B 66, 115315
(2002)] in the context of the FQHE in two-dimensional semiconductor quantum
dots. The EXD wave functions are compared with FQHE trial functions of the
Laughlin and the derived REM types. It is found that a variational extension of
the REM offers a better description for all fractional fillings compared with
that of the Laughlin functions (including total energies and overlaps), a fact
that reflects the strong azimuthal localization of the edge electrons. In
contrast with the multiring arrangements of electrons in circular semiconductor
quantum dots, the graphene REMs exhibit in all instances a single (0,N)
polygonal-ring molecular (crystalline) structure, with all the electrons
localized on the edge. Disruptions in the zig-zag boundary condition along the
circular edge act effectively as impurities that pin the electron molecule,
yielding single-particle densities with broken rotational symmetry that portray
directly the azimuthal localization of the edge electrons.

Kolmogorov himself repeatedly claimed, the mathematical theory of probabilities
cannot be applied to physical, factual probabilistic situations because the
factual concept of probability is not defined : it is nowhere specified how to
construct, for a given physical random phenomenon, the specific numerical
distribution of relative frequencies of outcomes from the universe of
elementary events produced by that phenomenon, that constitutes the factual
probability law to be asserted on this universe; nor is it known what
significance to associate to the assertion of mere 'existence' of such a
factual probability law. An algorithm of semantic integration of the factual
probability law to be asserted in any given factual probabilistic situation, is
then constructed. This algorithm, developed inside a general method of
relativized conceptualization, involves a quantification of the factual concept
of probability. These results, while solving Kolmogorov's aporia, fully
organize the general classical concept of probability, both syntactic and
factual. As for quantum mechanical 'probabilities', it comes out, surprisingly,
that, factually, they cannot be defined in an effective way: fundamental
quantum mechanics seems to be confined (observationally and even in principle)
to the establishment of only statistical distributions which, as far as finite
data can guarantee, are endowed with stability.

3-torus, transverse to the vector a . The corresponding maps belong to the
little group of the vector a in SL(3,Z_N) which is an SL(2,Z_N) subgroup. The
associated linear Nambu maps are generated by a pair of linear and quadratic
Hamiltonians (Clebsch-Monge potentials of the flow) and the corresponding
quantum maps, realize the metaplectic representation of SL(3,Z_N) on the
discrete group of three dimensional magnetic translations i.e. the
non-commutative 3-torus with deformation parameter the N-th root of unity.
  Other potential applications of our construction are related to the
quantization of deterministic chaos in turbulent maps as well as to quantum
tomography of three dimensional objects.

that this entanglement can be transferred to atomic ensembles placed within the

non unique, the non unicity allowing further optimization for given criteria.
The mathematical problem of tomography is thus the classification of all such

at finite temperature are determined. The analysis is based on a new method
(inspired by QED) of describing qubits, developed previously at zero
temperature (Phys. Rev. A 76, 062106 (2007)). In this paper, we make a
generalization to finite temperature by introducing the Matsubara formalism and
the temperature propagators. We analyze the spectral properties of different
types of propagators and we derive a direct connection between the temperature
propagators and the real time propagators. To show the effectiveness of this
method, we calculate the temperature dependence of the polarizability of a
two-level atom in the lowest order of perturbation theory and we predict an
unexpected sharpening of the resonance. The whole discussion is carried out
without the rotating wave approximation.

order moments) is introduced. Under this generalized framework of higher order
nonclassicality, conditions of higher order squeezing and higher order
subpoissonian photon statistics are derived. A simpler form of the Hong-Mandel
higher order squeezing criterion is derived under this framework by using an
operator ordering theorem introduced by us in [J. Phys. A. 33 (2000) 5607]. It
is also generalized for multi-photon Bose operators of Brandt and Greenberg.
Similarly, condition for higher order subpoissonian photon statistics is
derived by normal ordering of higher powers of number operator. Further, with
the help of simple density matrices, it is shown that the higher order
antibunching (HOA) and higher order subpoissonian photon statistics (HOSPS) are
not the manifestation of the same phenomenon and consequently it is incorrect
to use the condition of HOA as a test of HOSPS. It is also shown that the HOA
and HOSPS may exist even in absence of the corresponding lower order
phenomenon. Binomial state, nonlinear first order excited squeezed state
(NLESS) and nonlinear vacuum squeezed state (NLVSS) are used as examples of
quantum state and it is shown that these states may show higher order
nonclssical characteristics. It is observed that the Binomial state which is
always antibunched, is not always higher order squeezed and NLVSS which shows
higher order squeezing does not show HOSPS and HOA. The opposite is observed in
NLESS and consequently it is established that the HOSPS and HOS are two
independent signatures of higher order nonclassicality

hence the defect density in the final state of a one-dimensional Kitaev model
following a slow quench of the parameter $J_-$, which estimates the anisotropy
between the interactions, as $J_-(t)\sim -|t/\tau|$. Here, time $t$ goes from
$-\infty$ to $+\infty$ and $\tau$ defines the rate of change of the
Hamiltonian. In other words, the spin chain initially prepared in its ground
state is driven by changing $J_-$ linearly in time up to the quantum critical
point, which in the model considered here occurs at at $t=0$, reversed and then
gradually decreased to its initial value at the same rate. We have thoroughly
compared the reverse quenching with its counterpart forward quenching $i.e.,$
$J_-\sim t/\tau$. Our exact calculation shows that the probability of
excitations is zero for the wave vector at which the instantaneous energy gap
is zero at the critical point $J_{-}=0$ as opposed to the maximum value of
unity in the forward quenching. It is also shown that the defect density in the
final state following a reverse quenching, we propose here, is nearly half of
the defects generated in the forward quenching. We argue that the defects
produced when the system reaches the quantum critical point gets redistributed
in the wave vector space at the final time in case of reverse quenching whereas
it keeps on increasing till the final time in the forward quenching. We study
the entropy density and also the time evolution of the diagonal entropy density
in the case of the reverse quenching and compare it with the forward case.

a sinusoidal modulation of the tunneling matrix element assists higher-order
co-tunneling processes. Using this mechanism, we propose an efficient new
scheme for creating a coherent superposition of states in which all particles
are either on one site or all on the other site, the so-called NOON state. This
scheme yields an almost perfect NOON state periodically. For larger numbers of

more than one modulation frequency is employed. With this scheme, NOON states
with a larger number of particles could be realized with state-of-the-art
techniques for cold Bose gases in a double-well potential.

present a novel algorithm based on a discrete Hadamard quantum walk on a line
with one coin and two walkers whose purpose is to generate entanglement between
walkers. We provide several classical computer simulations of our quantum
algorithm in which we show that, although the asymptotical amount of
entanglement generated between walkers does not reach the highest degree of
entanglement possible at each step for either coin measurement outcome, the
entanglement ratio (entanglement generated/highest value of entanglement
possible, for each step) tends to converge, and the actual convergence value
depends on the coin initial state and on the coin measurement outcome.
Furthermore, our numerical simulations show that, for the quantum walks used in
our algorithm, the value towards which entanglement ratio converges also
depends on the position probability distribution symmetry of a quantum walk
computed with one single walker and the same coin initial state employed in the
corresponding quantum walk with two walkers.

quantum-state transfer between light and matter. Here we present a robust
photon-spin entangling gate with high fidelity and high efficiency (up to 50

electron spin states. We show this gate can be used for single-shot quantum

efficiently for a specific class of post-quantum non-local boxes, which we term
correlated non-local boxes. In the asymptotic limit, all correlated non-local

Then, taking advantage of a result of Brassard \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev.

many areas of physics, chemistry, and biology. The uncontrollable interaction

deteriorate its transport capacity, especially so when the system is
fundamentally quantum mechanical. Here we identify key mechanisms through which
noise such as dephasing, perhaps counter intuitively, may actually aid
transport through a dissipative network by opening up additional pathways for
excitation transfer. We show that these are processes that lead to the
inhibition of destructive interference and exploitation of line broadening
effects. We illustrate how these mechanisms operate on a fully connected
network by developing a powerful analytical technique that identifies the
invariant (excitation trapping) subspaces of a given Hamiltonian. Finally, we
show how these principles can explain the remarkable efficiency and robustness

PST of a qubit over distance regular spin networks and optimal state transfer

understood as information that each one carries about the other. In order to
give a model-independent description of secure information disposal, we propose
the paradigm of private quantum decoupling, corresponding to locally reducing
correlations in a given bipartite quantum state without transferring them to
the environment. In this framework, the concept of private local randomness
naturally arises as a resource, and total correlations get divided into
eliminable and ineliminable ones. We prove upper and lower bounds on the amount
of ineliminable correlations present in an arbitrary bipartite state, and show
that, in tripartite pure states, ineliminable correlations satisfy a monogamy
constraint, making apparent their quantum nature. A relation with entanglement
theory is provided by showing that ineliminable correlations constitute an
entanglement parameter. In the limit of infinitely many copies of the initial
state provided, we compute the regularized ineliminable correlations to be
measured by the coherent information, which is thus equipped with a new
operational interpretation. In particular, our results imply that two
subsystems can be privately decoupled if their joint state is separable.

  witnesses by using exact convex optimization</title><description>  A generic algorithm is developed to reduce the problem of obtaining linear
and nonlinear entanglement witnesses of a given quantum system, to convex
optimization problem. This approach is completely general and can be applied
for the entanglement detection of any N-partite quantum system. For this
purpose, a map from convex space of separable density matrices to a convex
region called feasible region is defined, where by using exact convex
optimization method, the linear entanglement witnesses can be obtained from
polygonal shape feasible regions, while for curved shape feasible regions,
envelope of the family of linear entanglement witnesses can be considered as
nonlinear entanglement witnesses. This method proposes a new methodological
framework within which most of previous EWs can be studied. To conclude and in
order to demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach, besides providing
some nonlinear witnesses for entanglement detection of density matrices in
unextendible product bases, W-states, and GHZ with W-states, some further
examples of three qubits systems and their classification and entanglement
detection are included. Also it is explained how one can manipulate most of the
non-decomposable linear and nonlinear three qubits entanglement witnesses
appearing in some of the papers published by us and other authors, by the
method proposed in this paper. Keywords: non-linear and linear entanglement

  of Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  We modify the Relative State Interpretation (RSI) of Quantum Mechanics so
that it does not imply many worlds and parallel realities. We drop the
assumption that probability amplitudes correspond one-to-one with reality: Not
all information is contained in amplitudes, and not all amplitudes need be
realized. Amplitudes do not &quot;collapse&quot; after a measurement, but evolve
continuously, including unrealized ones. After each &quot;event&quot; only one possible
outcome is realized. Therefore, if a value is measured, that value is real, all
others are not; there is only one reality and one world. Reality content is
&quot;quantized&quot; : unity for realized outcomes, zero for all others. It is
&quot;conserved&quot;: can move along any possible sequence of events, but only one at a
time. The modified RSI is is strictly deterministic in the sense that the
&quot;global&quot; probability amplitudes of the universe are determined for all times by
the laws of physics and the initial conditions. They guide all events. But it
is not deterministic in the sense that from the amplitudes one can not predict
which outcome actually happens; that represents new information that
accumulates as history unfolds. To the extent that information is part of the
physical world, the coming into being of the universe is ongoing, even after
the Big Bang. All predictions of the two versions agree, except possibly in
esoteric, untested cases.

  oscillations in Jaynes-Cummings model</title><description>  In this paper, we give an analytical treatment to study the behavior of the
collapse and the revival of the Rabi oscillations in the Jaynes-Cummings model
(JCM). The JCM is an exactly soluble quantum mechanical model, which describes
the interaction between a two-level atom and a single cavity mode of the
electromagnetic field. If we prepare the atom in the ground state and the
cavity mode in a coherent state initially, the JCM causes the collapse and the
revival of the Rabi oscillations many times in a complicated pattern in its
time-evolution. In this phenomenon, the atomic population inversion is
described with an intractable infinite series. (When the electromagnetic field
is resonant with the atom, the $n$th term of this infinite series is given by a
trigonometric function for $\sqrt{n}t$, where $t$ is a variable of the time.)
According to Klimov and Chumakov's method, using the Abel-Plana formula, we
rewrite this infinite series as a sum of two integrals. We examine the physical
meanings of these two integrals and find that the first one represents the
initial collapse (the semi-classical limit) and the second one represents the
revival (the quantum correction) in the JCM. Furthermore, we evaluate the first
and second-order perturbations for the time-evolution of the JCM with an
initial thermal coherent state for the cavity mode at low temperature, and
write down their correction terms as sums of integrals by making use of the
Abel-Plana formula.

represented by density operators. A control design based on the Hilbert-Schmidt
distance as a Lyapunov function is considered. The control dynamics is
redefined on an extended space where the LaSalle invariance principle can be
correctly applied even for non-stationary target states. LaSalle's invariance
principle is used to derive a general characterization of the invariant set,
which is shown to always contain the critical points of the Lyapunov function.
Critical point analysis of the latter is used to show that, for generic states,
it is a Morse function with $n!$ isolated critical points, including one global
minimum, one global maximum and $n!-2$ saddles. It is also shown, however, that
the actual dynamics of the system is not a gradient flow, and therefore a full
eigenvalue analysis of the linearized dynamics about the critical points of the
dynamical system is necessary to ascertain stability of the critical points.
This analysis shows that a generic target state is locally asymptotically
stable if the linearized system is controllable and the invariant set is
regular, and in fact convergence to the target state (trajectory) in this case
is almost global in that the stable manifolds of all other critical points form
a subset of measure zero of the state space. On the other hand, if either of
these sufficient conditions is not satisfied, the target state ceases to be
asymptotically stable, a center manifold emerges around the target state, and
the control design ceases to be effective.

  distribution</title><description>  The use of decoy states in quantum key distribution (QKD) has provided a
method for substantially increasing the secret key rate and distance that can
be covered by QKD protocols with practical signals. The security analysis of
these schemes, however, leaves open the possibility that the development of
better proof techniques, or better classical post-processing methods, might
further improve their performance in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we
derive upper bounds on the secure key rate for decoy state QKD. These bounds
are based basically only on the classical correlations established by the
legitimate users during the quantum communication phase of the protocol. The
only assumption about the possible post-processing methods is that double click
events are randomly assigned to single click events. Further we consider only
secure key rates based on the uncalibrated device scenario which assigns
imperfections such as detection inefficiency to the eavesdropper. Our analysis
relies on two preconditions for secure two-way and one-way QKD: The legitimate
users need to prove that there exists no separable state (in the case of
two-way QKD), or that there exists no quantum state having a symmetric
extension (one-way QKD), that is compatible with the available measurements
results. Both criteria have been previously applied to evaluate single-photon
implementations of QKD. Here we use them to investigate a realistic source of
weak coherent pulses. The resulting upper bounds can be formulated as a convex
optimization problem known as a semidefinite program which can be efficiently
solved. For the standard four-state QKD protocol, they are quite close to known
lower bounds, thus showing that there are clear limits to the further
improvement of classical post-processing techniques in decoy state QKD.

the multi-mode structure of the state gives rise to a new attack that decreases

  diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model</title><description>  Building on the work of Fisher et al. (Phys. Rev. B 40, 546 (1989)), we
develop a framework for perturbation theory in the Bose-Hubbard model and apply
it to calculate the effects of a degenerate gas of spin-polarized fermions
interacting by contact interactions with the constituent bosons. For the
single-band Bose-Hubbard model, the only non-trivial effect of the fermions is
to induce an effective space- and time-dependent density-density interaction
among the bosons. Using a path integral formulation, we develop the appropriate
theory describing the perturbative effects of this fermion-mediated interaction
(fermionic screening) on the generic superfluid-insulator phase diagram. For
the single-band Bose-Hubbard model, we find that the net effect of the fermions
is to inherently suppress the Mott-insulating lobes and enhance the area
occupied by the superfluid phase in the phase diagram. For the more general
multi-band Bose-Hubbard model, we find that, in addition to the fermion
screening of the boson interactions, the virtual excitations of the bosons to
the higher Bloch bands coupled with the contact interactions with the fermions
result in an effective increase of the boson on-site repulsion. If this
renormalization of the boson on-site potential is dominant over the fermion
screening of the boson interactions, the area of the Mott insulating lobes of
the Bose-Hubbard phase diagram will be enhanced for either sign of the
boson-fermion interactions, as seen in recent experiments.

system of four electrons in lateral double quantum dots are investigated using
exact diagonalization (EXD), as a function of interdot separation, applied
magnetic field, and strength of interelectron repulsion. A distinctly different
quantum behavior is found compared to that of circular single quantum dots. As
a function of the magnetic field, the energy spectra exhibit a low-energy band
consisting of a group of six states, with the number six being a consequence of
the conservation of the total spin of the four electrons and the ensuing spin
degeneracies. These six states appear to cross at a single value of the
magnetic field, with the crossing point becoming sharper for larger interdot
distances. As the strength of the Coulomb repulsion increases, the six states
tend to become degenerate and a well defined energy gap separates them from the
higher-in-energy excited states.
  The appearance of the low-energy band is a consequence of the formation of a
Wigner supermolecule, with the four electrons (two in each dot) being localized
at the vertices of a rectangular parallelogram. Using the spin-resolved
pair-correlation functions, one can map the EXD many-body wave functions onto
the spin functions associated with the four localized electrons. Analogies with
nanomagnets, such as finite Heisenberg clusters, are discussed. The ability to
determine associated spin functions enables investigations concerning
entanglement properties of the system of four electrons. In particular, the
formation of Wigner supermolecules generates EXD solutions belonging to the

By stacking several q-plates in a suitable sequence, one can also access to

completed. Hence N(d) cannot be d and when d&gt;1 we have a dichotomy: either
N(d)=d+1 (so that there exists a complete collection of MUBs), or N(d)\leq d-1.
In the course of the proof an interesting new characterization is given for a
linear subspace of M_d(C) to be a subalgebra.

with parallel processing capabilities. It is an accessible research tool that
permits rapid evaluation of quantum algorithms for a large number of qubits and
for various &quot;noise&quot; scenarios. The prime motivation for developing QCMPI is to
facilitate numerical examination of not only how QC algorithms work, but also
to include noise, decoherence, and attenuation effects and to evaluate the
efficacy of error correction schemes. The present work builds on an earlier
Mathematica code QDENSITY, which is mainly a pedagogic tool. In QCMPI, the
stress is on state vectors, in order to employ a large number of qubits. The
parallel processing feature is implemented by using the Message-Passing
Interface (MPI) protocol.
  Codes for Grover's search and Shor's factoring algorithms are provided as
examples. A major feature of this work is that concurrent versions of the
algorithms can be evaluated with each version subject to alternate noise
effects, which corresponds to the idea of solving a stochastic Schr\&quot;{o}dinger
equation.

between distant parties which are independent of the environment. This notion
is more general than the standard idea of a secret key -- it is a fully quantum
and more general form of privacy. The states which possess mutual independence
also generalize the so called private states -- those that possess private key.
We then show that the problem of distributed compression of quantum information
at distant sources can be solved in terms of mutual independence, if free
entanglement between the senders and the receiver is available. Namely, we
obtain a formula for the sum of rates of qubits needed to transmit a
distributed state between Alice and Bob to a decoder Charlie. We also show that
mutual independence is bounded from above by the relative entropy modulo a
conjecture, saying that if after removal of a single qubit the state becomes
product, its initial entanglement is bounded by 1. We suspect that mutual
independence is a highly singular quantity, i.e. that it is positive only on a
set of measure zero; furthermore, we believe that its presence is seen on the
single copy level. This appears to be born out in the classical case.

(e.g. orientation of the Stern Gerlach magnet in spin measurements) with
arbitrary precision. If the reference frames are &quot;bounded&quot; (i.e. quantum
systems themselves, having a finite number of degrees of freedom), only limited
precision can be attained. Using spin coherent states as bounded reference
frames we have found their minimal size needed to violate local realism for
entangled spin systems. For composite systems of spin-1/2 particles reference
frames of very small size are sufficient for the violation; however, to see
this violation for macroscopic entangled spins, the size of the reference frame
must be at least quadratically larger than that of the spins. Unavailability of
such reference frames gives a possible explanation for the non-observance of
violation of local realism in everyday experience.

techniques involving finitely correlated states. With these methods, universal
states were found which are in certain ways much less entangled than the
original cluster state model, and it was hence believed that with this approach
many of the extremal entanglement features of the cluster states could be
relaxed. The new resources were constructed as &quot;computationally universal&quot;
states--i.e. they allow one to efficiently reproduce the classical output of
each quantum computation--whereas the cluster states are universal in a
stronger sense since they are &quot;universal state preparators&quot;. Here we show that
the new resources are universal state preparators after all, and must therefore
exhibit a whole class of extremal entanglement features, similar to the cluster

order to enhance the precision of the measurement of classical quantities, like
the length of an optical cavity. The major goal is to beat the standard quantum
limit (SQL), i.e. a precision of order $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the number of
quantum resources (e.g. the number of photons or atoms used), and to achieve a
scaling $1/N$, known as the Heisenberg limit. Doing so would have tremendous
impact in many areas, but so far only three experiments have demonstrated a
slight improvement over the SQL. The required quantum states are generally
difficult to produce, and very prone to decoherence. Here we show that
decoherence itself may be used as an extremely sensitive probe of system
properties. This should allow for a new measurement principle with the

pure de Sitter space, here we are mainly interested on the effects induced by
the presence of the string. So this analysis is developed by expressing the
complete Wightman function as the sum of two terms: The first one corresponds
to the bulk where the cosmic string is absent and the second one is induced by
the presence of the string. By using the Abel-Plana summation formula, we show
that for points away from the string the latter is finite at the coincidence
limit and it is used to evaluate the vacuum averages of the square of the field

system with a given number $m$ of electrons occupying a given number $n$ of
spin orbitals. Each spin orbital is mapped to a qubit: the states $| 1 &gt;$ and
$| 0&gt;$ of the qubit represent, respectively, whether the spin orbital is
occupied by an electron or not. To prepare a general state in the full Hilbert
space of $n$ qubits, which is of dimension $2^{n}$%, $O(2^{n})$ controlled-NOT
gates are needed, i.e., the number of gates scales \emph{exponentially} with
the number of qubits. We make use of the fact that the state to be prepared
lies in a smaller Hilbert space, and we find an algorithm that requires at most
$O(2^{m+1} n^{m}/{m!})$ gates, i.e., scales \emph{polynomially} with the number
of qubits $n$, provided $n\gg m$. The algorithm is simulated numerically for
the cases of the hydrogen molecule and the water molecule. The numerical
simulations show that when additional symmetries of the system are considered,
the number of gates to prepare the state can be drastically reduced, in the
examples considered in this paper, by several orders of magnitude, from the
above estimate.

functions of the number of particles for four quantum many-body systems, i.e.
atoms, nuclei, atomic clusters, and correlated atoms in a trap (bosons). A pair
of order and disorder strengths, evaluated for each system, can serve as a Pair
of Order-Disorder Indices (PODI), characterizing quantitatively order versus
disorder in any quantum system. According to the above classification, we
assign to bosons the complexity character of disorder, to atoms the character
of order, while nuclei and atomic clusters are (less) disordered and lie
between them. This criterion can be used to estimate the relative contribution
of order and disorder to complexity for other more complicated quantum systems
as well and even classical ones, if one is able to describe them
probabilistically. We also address the issue, whether those systems can grow in
complexity as the number of particles increases. Our comparative study
indicates that atoms are the only quantum system out of four, which is ordered,
with the ability to self-organize. We conjecture that this is an

new physics in the solid-state, and is expected to play a vital role in future

  energy eigenvalues</title><description>  Despite its common use in quantum theory, the mathematical requirement of
Dirac Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian is sufficient to guarantee the reality of
energy eigenvalues but not necessary. By establishing three theorems, this
paper gives physical conditions that are both necessary and sufficient. First,
it is shown that if the secular equation is real, the Hamiltonian is
necessarily PT symmetric. Second, if a linear operator C that obeys the two
equations [C,H]=0 and C^2=1 is introduced, then the energy eigenvalues of a
PT-symmetric Hamiltonian that is diagonalizable are real only if this C
operator commutes with PT. Third, the energy eigenvalues of PT-symmetric
Hamiltonians having a nondiagonalizable, Jordan-block form are real. These
theorems hold for matrix Hamiltonians of any dimensionality.

its solvability, if couplings are appropriately chosen. This provides a new
class of integrable systems. A simplified way of solution is given, by
recasting the known solution of the Dirac oscillator into matrix form; there
one notices, that a block-diagonal form arises in a Hamiltonian formulation.
The blocks are two-dimensional. Choosing couplings that do not affect the block

classically. One such restriction is that we cannot copy an arbitrary quantum
state. This is known as No-cloning theorem. Although quantum mechanics forbid
us to construct a perfect cloner, there is no restriction to construct an
imperfect cloner. Therefore, we have constructed and studied a special kind of
quantum cloning machine named as Hybrid quantum cloning machine which is
nothing but a different combination of pre-existing quantum cloning machines.
We showed that this hybrid quantum cloning machine sometime gives better
quality copy than the pre-existing quantum cloners. Quantum entanglement is a
very astonishing property in a multi-partite system and it is a very useful
ingredient of quantum information theory. Therefore broadcasting (cloning) of
entanglement is a very important subject to study. In this regard we have
studied the broadcasting of entanglement using state dependent quantum cloning
machine. Further, we have investigated the problem of secretly broadcasting of
three-qubit entangled state between two distant partners. Linearity of quantum
mechanics put another restriction on deletion of an arbitrary quantum state
i.e. an arbitrary quantum state against a copy cannot be perfectly deleted.
Like cloning machine one can construct an approximate deletion machine also.
Therefore, we have constructed an universal deletion machine in the sense that
the fidelity of deletion does not depend on the input state and showed that the
fidelity of deletion is 3/4 . Further we showed that the fidelity of deletion
depends on the blank state at the output and it can be improved from the value
3/4 for certain blank state. Moreover, we have studied the case where two
cloned copies are given at the input of the deletion machine.

  Nonlinearity in a Cavity QED System</title><description>  The already very active field of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED),
traditionally studied in atomic systems, has recently gained additional
momentum by the advent of experiments with semiconducting and superconducting
systems. In these solid state implementations, novel quantum optics experiments
are enabled by the possibility to engineer many of the characteristic
parameters at will. In cavity QED, the observation of the vacuum Rabi mode
splitting is a hallmark experiment aimed at probing the nature of matter-light
interaction on the level of a single quantum. However, this effect can, at
least in principle, be explained classically as the normal mode splitting of
two coupled linear oscillators. It has been suggested that an observation of
the scaling of the resonant atom-photon coupling strength in the
Jaynes-Cummings energy ladder with the square root of photon number n is
sufficient to prove that the system is quantum mechanical in nature. Here we
report a direct spectroscopic observation of this characteristic quantum
nonlinearity. Measuring the photonic degree of freedom of the coupled system,
our measurements provide unambiguous, long sought for spectroscopic evidence
for the quantum nature of the resonant atom-field interaction in cavity QED. We
explore atom-photon superposition states involving up to two photons, using a
spectroscopic pump and probe technique. The experiments have been performed in
a circuit QED setup, in which ultra strong coupling is realized by the large
dipole coupling strength and the long coherence time of a superconducting qubit
embedded in a high quality on-chip microwave cavity.

based on the eigen-decomposition of the map. A unitary matrix can be
implemented by sequentially mapping each eigenvector to a fiducial state,
imprinting the eigenphase on that state, and mapping it back to the
eigenvector. This requires the design of only $d$ state-to-state maps generated
by control waveforms that are efficiently found by a gradient search with
computational resources that scale polynomially in $d$. In contrast, the
complexity of a stochastic search for a single waveform that simultaneously
acts as desired on all eigenvectors scales exponentially in $d$. We extend this
construction to design maps on an $n$-dimensional subspace of the Hilbert space
using only $n$ stochastic searches. Additionally, we show how these techniques

one can find tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of players playing poker via
their computers on the major on-line gaming sites. Indeed, according to the
Vancouver, B.C. based pokerpulse.com estimates, more than 190 million US
dollars daily is bet in on-line poker rooms. But communication and computation
are changing as the relentless application of Moore's Law brings computation
and information into the quantum realm. The quantum theory of games concerns
the behavior of classical games when played in the coming quantum computing
environment or when played with quantum information. In almost all cases, the
&quot;quantized&quot; versions of these games afford many new strategic options to the
players.
  The study of so-called quantum games is quite new, arising from a seminal
paper of D. Meyer \cite{Meyer} published in Physics Review Letters in 1999. The
ensuing near decade has seen an explosion of contributions and controversy over
what exactly a quantized game really is and if there is indeed anything new for
game theory. With the settling of some of these controversies \cite{Bleiler},
it is now possible to fully analyze some of the basic endgame models from the
game theory of Poker and predict with confidence just how the optimal play of
Poker will change when played in the coming quantum computation environment.
The analysis here shows that for certain players, &quot;entangled&quot; poker will allow
results that outperform those available to players &quot;in real life&quot;.

as a means to effect a quantum non-demolition measurement of a single photon

\mu\mathrm{m}$ in single-crystal diamond containing a dilute ensemble of NV$^-$
of only 200 centres are sufficient for quantum non-demolition measurements
using EIT-based weak nonlinear interactions.

  measurement data</title><description>  Many experiments in quantum information aim at creating multi-partite
entangled states. Quantifying the amount of entanglement that was actually
generated can, in principle, be accomplished using full-state tomography. This
method requires the determination of a parameter set that is growing
exponentially with the number of qubits and becomes infeasible even for
moderate numbers of particles. Non-trivial bounds on experimentally prepared
entanglement can however be obtained from partial information on the density
matrix. The fundamental question that needs to be addressed in this context is
then formulated as: What is the entanglement content of the least entangled
quantum state that is compatible with the available measurement data?
  We formulate the problem mathematically employing methods from the theory of
semi-definite programming and then address this problem for the case, where the
goal of the experiment is the creation of graph states. The observables that we
consider are the generators of the stabilizer group, thus the number of
measurement settings grows only linearly in the number of qubits. We provide
analytical solutions as well as numerical methods that may be applied directly
to experiments, and compare the obtained bounds with results from full-state
tomography for simulated data.

  consistency argument that the electromagnetic field must be quantized</title><description>  We analyze Niels Bohr's proposed two-slit interference experiment with highly
charged particles that argues that the consistency of elementary quantum
mechanics requires that the electromagnetic field must be quantized. In the
experiment a particle's path through the slits is determined by measuring the
Coulomb field that it produces at large distances; under these conditions the
interference pattern must be suppressed. The key is that as the particle's
trajectory is bent in diffraction by the slits it must radiate and the
radiation must carry away phase information. Thus the radiation field must be a
quantized dynamical degree of freedom. On the other hand, if one similarly
tries to determine the path of a massive particle through an inferometer by
measuring the Newtonian gravitational potential the particle produces, the
interference pattern would have to be finer than the Planck length and thus
undiscernable. Unlike for the electromagnetic field, Bohr's argument does not
imply that the gravitational field must be quantized.

states for ultracold bosons occupying two bands of an optical lattice. The two
atomic states are resonantly coupled by a single cavity mode which mediates
transitions between the two bosonic particle modes via absorption or emission
of a cavity photon. This coupling between the bands shifts the appearance of
the Mott insulator phase towards deeper optical lattice potentials and stronger
on-site interaction strength, as atomic coherence can build up via photon
assisted tunneling in both bands. Varying the intra and interband on-site
interactions leads to several different atomic phase configurations. There are
even parameter regions where a mean field approach predicts concurrence of a
Mott insulator state in one band, while atoms in the second band stay
superfluid.

We show how a physical description in which the best measurement conceivable,

in a $\Lambda$-type atomic medium. This protocol derives from spectral hole
burning and takes advantages of the specific properties of solid state systems
at low temperature, such as rare earth ion doped crystals. The signal pulse is
tuned to the center of the hole that has been burnt previously within the
inhomogeneously broadened absorption band. The group velocity is strongly
reduced, being proportional to the hole width. This way the optically carried
information and energy is carried over to the off-resonance optical dipoles.
Storage and retrieval are performed by conversion to and from ground state
Raman coherence by using brief $\pi$-pulses. The protocol exhibits some
resemblance with the well known electromagnetically induced transparency
process. It also presents distinctive features such as the absence of coupling
beam. In this paper we detail the various steps of the protocol, summarize the
critical parameters and theoretically examine the recovery efficiency.

convergence results for the asymptotic state of $\mathcal{H}$. This is achieved
by studying spectral properties of (random) quantum channels which guarantee
the existence of unique invariant states. Finally this allows to introduce a

field in a five-dimensional rotating, charged black hole constructed by Cvetic

This black hole solution represents a natural generalization of the famous
four-dimensional Kerr-Newman solution to five dimensions with the inclusion of
a Chern-Simons term to the Maxwell equation. It is shown that the usual Dirac
equation can not be separated by variables in this general spacetime with two
independent angular momenta. However if one supplements an additional
counterterm into the usual Dirac operator, then the modified Dirac equation for
the spin-1/2 spinor particles is separable in this rotating, charged
Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons black hole background geometry. A first-order
symmetry operator that commutes with the modified Dirac operator has exactly
the same form as that previously found in the uncharged Myers-Perry black hole
case. It is expressed in terms of a rank-three totally antisymmetric tensor and
its covariant derivative. This tensor obeys a generalized Killing-Yano equation
and its square is a second-order symmetric Stackel-Killing tensor admitted by
the five-dimensional rotating, charged black hole spacetime.

(UDD) sequence in a variety of noise environments. Our qubit system consists of
a crystalline array of $^{9}$Be$^{+}$ ions confined in a Penning trap. We use
an electron-spin-flip transition as our qubit manifold and drive qubit
rotations using a 124 GHz microwave system. We study the effect of the UDD
sequence in mitigating phase errors and compare against the well known
CPMG-style multipulse spin echo as a function of pulse number, rotation axis,
noise spectrum, and noise strength. Our results agree well with theoretical
predictions for qubit decoherence in the presence of classical phase noise,
accounting for the effect of finite-duration $\pi$ pulses. Finally, we
demonstrate that the Uhrig sequence is more robust against systematic
over/underrotation and detuning errors than is multipulse spin echo, despite
the precise prescription for pulse-timing in UDD.

  Dimension</title><description>  We show that it is possible to use a classical computer to efficiently
simulate the adiabatic evolution of a quantum system in one dimension with a
constant spectral gap, starting the adiabatic evolution from a known initial
product state. The proof relies on a recently proven area law for such systems,
implying the existence of a good matrix product representation of the ground
state, combined with an appropriate algorithm to update the matrix product
state as the Hamiltonian is changed. This implies that adiabatic evolution with
such Hamiltonians is not useful for universal quantum computation. Therefore,
adiabatic algorithms which are useful for universal quantum computation either
require a spectral gap tending to zero or need to be implemented in more than
one dimension (we leave open the question of the computational power of
adiabatic simulation with a constant gap in more than one dimension).

interpretative problems. Foundational research has been an important factor in
the development of quantum cryptography, quantum information theory and,
perhaps one day, practical quantum computers. Many believe that, in turn,
quantum information theory has bearing on foundational research. This is
largely related to the so-called epistemic view of quantum states, which
maintains that the state vector represents information on a system and has led
to the suggestion that quantum theory needs no interpretation. I will argue
that this and related approaches fail to take into consideration two different
explanatory functions of quantum mechanics, namely that of accounting for
classically unexplainable correlations between classical phenomena and that of
explaining the microscopic structure of classical objects. If interpreting
quantum mechanics means answering the question, &quot;How can the world be for
quantum mechanics to be true?&quot;, there seems to be no way around it.

but elements of reality associated with a product of two commuting operators
will not always be equal to the product of elements of reality associated with
each operator. I will finally examine a number of ways in which the paradoxical
features of Hardy's experiment can be better understood.

  II. Continuous time limit and state-variable approach to phase-locked loop

estimation, we design homodyne phase-locked loops that can measure the temporal

also investigate the fundamental uncertainties in the simultaneous estimation

  bath. II. Ensemble dynamics</title><description>  Decoherence of a center spin or qubit in a spin bath is essentially
determined by the many-body bath evolution. The bath dynamics can start either
from a pure state or, more generally, from a statistical ensemble. In the
preceding article [W. Yang and R. B. Liu, Phys. Rev. B \textbf{78}, 085315
(2008)], we have developed the cluster-correlation expansion (CCE) theory for
the so-called single-sample bath dynamics initiated from a factorizable pure
state. Here we present the ensemble CCE theory, which is based on similar ideas
of the single-sample CCE: The bath evolution is factorized into the product of
all possible cluster correlations, each of which accounts for the authentic
(non-factorizable) collective excitation of a group of bath spins, and for the
finite-time evolution in the qubit decoherence problem, convergent results can
be obtained by truncating the ensemble CCE by keeping cluster correlations up
to a certain size. A difference between the ensemble CCE and single-sample CCE
is that the mean-field treatment in the latter formalism of the diagonal part
of the spin-spin interaction in the bath is not possible in the former case.
The ensemble CCE can be applied to non-factorizable initial states. The
ensemble CCE is checked against the exact solution of an XY spin bath model.
For small spin baths, it is shown that single-sample dynamics is sensitive to
the sampling of the initial state from a thermal ensemble and hence very
different from the ensemble average.

outputs a z in Z such that (x,y,z) in f. We first show optimal 'Direct sum'
results for all relations f in this model, both in the quantum and classical
settings, in the situation where we allow shared resources (shared entanglement
in quantum protocols and public coins in classical protocols) between Alice and
Referee and Bob and Referee and no shared resource between Alice and Bob. This
implies that, in this model, the communication required to compute k
simultaneous instances of f, with constant success overall, is at least k-times
the communication required to compute one instance with constant success.
  This in particular implies an earlier Direct sum result, shown by
Chakrabarti, Shi, Wirth and Yao, 2001, for the Equality function (and a class
of other so-called robust functions), in the classical smp model with no shared
resources between any parties.
  Furthermore we investigate the gap between the smp model and the one-way

exponentially more expensive in the former if quantum communication with
entanglement is allowed, compared to the latter even in the deterministic case.

collections of indistinguishable objects. After presenting an outline of this
theory, we define an algebra that has most of the standard properties of an
orthocomplete orthomodular lattice, which is the lattice of the closed
subspaces of a Hilbert space. We call the mathematical structure so obtained
$\mathfrak{I}$-lattice. After discussing, in a preliminary form, some aspects
of such a structure, we indicate the next problem of axiomatizing the
corresponding logic, that is, a logic which has $\mathfrak{I}$-lattices as its
algebraic models. We suggest that the intuitions that the `logic of quantum
mechanics' would be not classical logic (with its Boolean algebra), is
consonant with the idea of considering indistinguishability right from the
start, that is, as a primitive concept. In other words, indiscernibility seems
to lead `directly' to $\mathfrak{I}$-lattices. In the first sections, we
present the main motivations and a `classical' situation which mirrors that one
we focus on the last part of the paper. This paper is our first study of the
algebraic structure of indiscernibility within quasi-set theory.

an ultracold Fermi gas in a non-Abelian U(2) gauge potential characterized by a

exhibits a robust band structure with large gaps and reveals a new fractal
figure. The transverse conductivity is related to topological invariants and is
shown to be quantized when the Fermi energy lies inside a gap of the spectrum.
We demonstrate that the analogue of the integer quantum Hall effect for neutral

and long-lived qubits would be a scientific watershed, harnessing the laws of
quantum physics to solve classically intractable problems. The design of many
proposed quantum computational platforms is driven by competing needs:
isolating the quantum system from the environment to prevent decoherence, and
easily and accurately controlling the system with external fields. For example,
neutral-atom optical-lattice architectures provide environmental isolation
through the use of states that are robust against fluctuating external fields,
yet external fields are essential for qubit addressing. Here we demonstrate the
selection of individual qubits with external fields, despite the fact that the
qubits are in field-insensitive superpositions. We use a spatially
inhomogeneous external field to map selected qubits to a different
field-insensitive superposition (&quot;optical MRI&quot;), minimally perturbing
unselected qubits, despite the fact that the addressing field is not spatially
localized. We show robust single-qubit rotations on neutral-atom qubits located
at selected lattice sites. This precise coherent control is an important step
forward for lattice-based neutral-atom quantum computation, and is quite
generally applicable to state transfer and qubit isolation in other
architectures using field-insensitive qubits.

trapped ions. At each node, single trapped ions embedded into high finesse
cavities emit single photons whose polarization is entangled with the ion
state. A specific detection of two photons at a central station located
half-way between two nodes heralds the entanglement of two remote ions.
Entanglement can be extended to long distances by applying successive
entanglement swapping operations based on two-ion gate operations that have
already been demonstrated experimentally with high precision. Our calculation
shows that the distribution rate of entanglement achievable with such an
ion-based quantum repeater protocol is higher by orders of magnitude than the
rates that are achievable with the best known schemes based on atomic ensemble
memories and linear optics. The main reason is that for trapped ions the
entanglement swapping operations are performed deterministically, in contrast
to success probabilities below 50 percent per swapping with linear optics. The
scheme requires efficient collection of the emitted photons, which can be
achieved with cavities, and efficient conversion of their wavelength, which can
be done via stimulated parametric down-conversion. We also suggest how to
realize temporal multiplexing, which offers additional significant speed-ups in
entanglement distribution, with trapped ions.

possible implementation of state transfer through bosonic atoms trapped in
optical lattices or polaritons in on-chip coupled cavities. Significantly, a
family of Hamiltonians, both linear and nonlinear, is found which are related

depend solely on the dimension of the lattice. For one and two dimensions it
equals one, meaning unit probability to return to the origin. This result is
extremely sensitive to the directional symmetry, any deviation from the equal
probability to travel in each direction results in a change of the character of
the walk from recurrent to transient. Applying our definition of the Polya
number to quantum walks on a line we show that the recurrence character of
quantum walks is more stable against bias. We determine the range of parameters
for which biased quantum walks remain recurrent. We find that there exist
genuine biased quantum walks which are recurrent.

in terms of quantum jumps [J. Piilo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 180402
(2008)]. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to have a jump description
contained in the physical Hilbert space of the reduced system. The developed
non-Markovian quantum jump (NMQJ) approach is a generalization of the Markovian
Monte Carlo Wave Function (MCWF) method into the non-Markovian regime. The
method conserves both the probabilities in the density matrix and the norms of
the state vectors exactly, and sheds new light on non-Markovian dynamics. The
dynamics of the pure state ensemble illustrates how local-in-time master
equation can describe memory effects and how the current state of the system
carries information on its earlier state. Our approach solves the problem of
negative jump probabilities of the Markovian MCWF method in the non-Markovian
regime by defining the corresponding jump process with positive probability.
The results demonstrate that in the theoretical description of non-Markovian
open systems, there occurs quantum jumps which recreate seemingly lost
superpositions due to the memory.

purely based on geometric phases of two spin-1/2's with Ising-like interaction
in a magnetic field with a static z-component and a rotating xy-component. This
is an interesting problem both for the purpose of measuring the geometric
phases and in quantum computing applications. In previous approach, coupling of
one of the qubit with the rotating component of field is ignored. By
considering the exact two-spin geometric phases, we find that a nontrivial
two-spin unitary transformation purely based on Berry phases can be obtained by
using two consecutive cycles with opposite directions of the magnetic field and
opposite signs of the interaction constant. In the nonadiabatic case, starting
with a certain initial state, a cycle in the projected space of rays and thus
Aharonov-Anandan phase can be achieved. The two-cycle scheme cancels the total

this respect, we regard the former as a direct generalization of the latter,
allowing a rotational quantum flow. We then ask for the most likely wave

information entropy over the quantum probability density. We show that there
exists a class of solutions in which the wave function is self-trapped,
rotationally symmetric, spatially localized with finite support, and spinning
around its center, yet stationary. The stationarity comes from the balance
between the attractive quantum force field of a trapping quantum potential
generated by quantum probability density and the repulsive centrifugal force of
a rotating velocity vector field. We further show that there is a limiting case
where the wave function is non-spinning and yet still stationary. This special

defined in an extended Hilbert space associated to the different
configurational states of the local nano-environment. After tracing out the

to the scattered laser field, like optical spectrum, intensity-intensity

in a unified way both the full quantum nature of the scattered laser field as

different processes such as spectral diffusion, lifetime fluctuations, and

superconducting flux qubit is discussed. We show that by inducing quantum
interference to cancel detrimental carrier excitations, ground state cooling
becomes possible in the weak-confinement or non-resolved regime. The qubit is
modelled as a three-level system in lambda configuration, and the driving
fluxes are applied such that the qubit absorption spectrum exhibits
electromagnetically induced transparency, thereby cancelling the unwanted
carrier excitation. As our interference-based scheme allows to apply strong

zero-point and thermal fluctuations. The Casimir effect is very general and
finds applications in various fields of physics. This review is limited to the
rapid progress at the intersection of experiment and theory that has been
achieved in the last few years. It includes a critical assessment of the
proposed approaches to the resolution of the puzzles arising in the
applications of the Lifshitz theory of the van der Waals and Casimir forces to
real materials. All the primary experiments on the measurement of the Casimir
force between macroscopic bodies and the Casimir-Polder force between an atom
and a wall that have been performed in the last decade are reviewed, including
the theory needed for their interpretation. The methodology for the comparison
between experiment and theory in the force-distance measurements is presented.
The experimental and theoretical results described here provide a deeper
understanding of the phenomenon of dispersion forces in real materials and
offer guidance for the application of Lifshitz theory for the interpretation of
the measurement results.

Physica A [246 (1997), 275]. The present paper includes argumentation, proofs
and details omitted in the shortened version. The papers are a further
development of the approach in quantum statistical mechanics proposed by the
author. The hierarchy of equations for reduced density matrices obtained
previously is extended to the case corresponding to the Bose-Einstein
condensation. The relevant state of the system with a condensate can be
superfluid as well as nonsuperfluid. Special attention is given to the
thermodynamics of superfluid systems. According to the results of the papers
superfluidity is the state of a fluid whose symmetry is spontaneously broken
because of a stationary flow. The state corresponds to thermodynamic
equilibrium while the magnitude of the flow depends upon the temperature and is
determined by thermodynamic considerations. The equations obtained are solved
in two simple cases. The physical origin of superfluidity, peculiarities of the
phenomenon in closed volumes and the critical velocity are discussed as well.

assumption of correctness - guaranteeing that honest players obtain their
correct outcomes - we show that every protocol implementing a non-trivial
primitive necessarily leaks information to a dishonest player. This extends
known impossibility results to all non-trivial primitives. We provide a
framework for quantifying this leakage and argue that leakage is a good measure
for the privacy provided to the players by a given protocol. Our framework also
covers the case where the two players are helped by a trusted third party. We
show that despite the help of a trusted third party, the players cannot amplify
the cryptographic power of any primitive. All our results hold even against
quantum honest-but-curious adversaries who honestly follow the protocol but
purify their actions and apply a different measurement at the end of the

through a quantum channel, can be perfectly restored. This can be done by
'coding' the state space of the system before transmission into a 'protected'
part of a larger state space, and by applying a proper 'decoding' map
afterwards. We investigate two kinds of protected subspaces: the error
correction subspaces and the dark subspaces. In neither case information leaks
out of the system, but in the second it is more difficult to restore the state.
Recent results on higher rank numerical ranges of operators are used to
construct examples. In particular, dark spaces are constructed for any map of
rank 2, for a biased permutations channel and for certain separable maps acting
on multipartite systems. Furthermore, error correction subspaces are provided
for a class of three unitary noise models.

in terms of well-known principles for systems of identical particles, and hence
furnish an up-to-date example for the teaching of quantum mechanics.

relativistic observer-participant manner, an operator symmetry of &quot;microscopic
observer-participation&quot; called Measurement Color (MC) is incorporated into the
field theoretic structure of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) in the Heisenberg
Picture. It is found that the resultant Measurement Color Quantum
Electrodynamics (MC-QED) contains a microscopic quantum electrodynamic arrow of
time that emerges dynamically, independent of any thermodynamic or cosmological
assumptions. This occurs because the photon has a negative time parity in
MC-QED. This causes a spontaneous breaking of the T and CPT symmetry to be
generated by the physical requirement that a stable vacuum state exists in the
MC-QED formalimm. This dynamically selects operator solutions containing a
causal, retarded, quantum electrodynamic arrow of time due in the Heisenberg
operator equations of motion. In support of the validity of this idea we show
that a classic nonlinear optics experiment in the scientific literature, which
involves a Michelson interferometer using combinations of ordinary mirrors and
phase conjugate mirrors, contains experimental results which support the idea
that the photon has a negative parity under Wigner time reversal and thus
carries the arrow of time in the universe.

  dielectrics and conductors</title><description>  We determine the commutation relations satisfied by the quantized
electromagnetic field in the presence of macroscopic dielectrics and
conductors, with arbitrary dispersive and dissipative properties. We consider
in detail the case of two plane-parallel material slabs, separated by an empty
gap, and we show that at all points in the empty region between the slabs,
including their surfaces, the electromagnetic fields always satisfy free-field
canonical equal-time commutation relations. This result is a consequence of
general analyticity and fall-off properties at large frequencies satisfied by
the reflection coefficients of all real materials. It is also shown that this
result does not obtain in the case of conductors, if the latter are modelled as
perfect mirrors. In such a case, the free-field form of the commutation
relations is recovered only at large distances from the mirrors, in agreement
with the findings of previous authors. Failure of perfect-mirror boundary
conditions to reproduce the correct form of the commutation relations near the
surfaces of the conductors, suggests that caution should be used when these
idealized boundary conditions are used in investigations of proximity phenomena
originating from the quantized electromagnetic field, like the Casimir effect.

  electrodynamics</title><description>  Scale covariance -- the notion that there is no absolute size, only relative
size -- is probably as old an idea as translation covariance. Yet, in our
laboratories we find no evidence for this appealing symmetry. For this reason,
privileged length-scales, such as the Compton length or the Bohr radius, enter
directly the \emph{equations} of physics rather than surfacing as attributes of
specific \emph{solutions}, in analogy to the way a privileged position is
introduced into a translation covariant equation by any localized solution. We
propose to elevate the status of a scaling symmetry to that of translation
symmetry. Within our proposed theory, a solution may `drift in scale', thereby
offering a mechanism by which matter may `cluster in scale' in analogy to
spatial clustering in galaxies (particles comprising galaxies all have almost
the same position on the intergalactic scale). Our proposed theory is a scale
covariant deformation of classical electrodynamics, reducing to the later in
its domain of validity. The resultant theory, dubbed Extended Charge Dynamics
(ECD), is a remarkably rich theory, containing ingredients encountered nowhere
else in theoretical physics, yet economically formulated as a simple
variational principle. We argue the case for ECD being a `hidden variables
model' for quantum mechanics i.e. that quantum mechanics describe statistical
aspects of ensembles of ECD solutions. Among else, this perspective offers at
once a prediction, pertaining to the notion of a photon, which is at odds with
current theory. We further speculate that the same `remote sensing' mechanism
endowed by ECD to a charge, responsible for many quantum mechanical effects, is
also behind gravitational effects.

in the two-dimensional (2D) atomic hydrogen bound to the surface of superfluid
helium below 0.1 K. Owing to the symmetry considerations, the microwave-induced
triplet-singlet transitions of atomic pairs in the fully spin-polarized sample
are forbidden. The apparent nonzero shift is associated with the
density-dependent wall shift of the hyperfine constant and the pressure shift
due to the presence of H atoms in the hyperfine state $a$ not involved in the
observed $b\to c$ transition. The interaction of adsorbed atoms with one
another effectively decreases the binding energy and, consequently, the wall
shift by the amount proportional to their density. The pressure shift of the
$b\to c$ resonance comes from the fact that the impurity $a$-state atoms
interact differently with the initial $b$-state and final $c$-state atoms and
is also linear in density. The net effect of the two contributions, both
specific for 2D hydrogen, is comparable with the experimental observation. To
our knowledge, this is the first mentioning of the density-dependent wall
shift. We also show that the difference between the triplet and singlet
scattering lengths of H atoms, $a_t-a_s=30(5)$ pm, is exactly twice smaller
than the value reported by Ahokas {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf101},

The expressions are non-relativistic and hence valid provided the eigenstate

the multitude of channels available for state decay.

the creation of a controlled 2.7 kg macroscopic oscillator with an effective

foundation for the first step of a MQM experiment: the preparation of a
macroscopic test mass into a nearly minimum-Heisenberg-limited Gaussian quantum

in a broad frequency band. Our formalism, based on Wiener filtering, allows a
straightforward conversion from the classical noise budget of a laser

potential scattering is developed and discussed. The starting points are two
exact path integral representations of the T-matrix, which permit the
application of the Feynman-Jensen variational method. A simple Ansatz for the
trial action is made, and, in both cases, the variational procedure singles out
a particular one-particle classical equation of motion, given in integral form.
While the first is real, in the second representation this trajectory is
complex and evolves according to an effective, time dependent potential. Using
a cumulant expansion, the first correction to the variational approximation is
also evaluated. The high energy behavior of the approximation is investigated,
and is shown to contain exactly the leading and next-to-leading order of the
eikonal expansion, and parts of higher terms. Our results are then numerically
tested in two particular situations where others approximations turned out to
be unsatisfactory. Substantial improvements are found.

The main idea is that the vacuum fluctuates permanently, which explains the

$W(E_6)$. The 27 charges correspond to the points and the 45 terms in the
entropy formula to the lines of GQ$(2,4)$. Different truncations with $15, 11$
and 9 charges are represented by three distinguished subconfigurations of
GQ$(2,4)$, well-known to finite geometers; these are the &quot;doily&quot; (i. e.
GQ$(2,2)$) with 15, the &quot;perp-set&quot; of a point with 11, and the &quot;grid&quot; (i. e.
GQ$(2,1)$) with 9 points, respectively. In order to obtain the correct signs
for the terms in the entropy formula, we use a non- commutative labelling for
the points of GQ$(2,4)$. For the 40 different possible truncations with 9
charges this labelling yields 120 Mermin squares -- objects well-known from
studies concerning Bell-Kochen-Specker-like theorems. These results are
connected to our previous ones obtained for the $E_{7(7)}$ symmetric entropy
formula in D=4 by observing that the structure of GQ$(2,4)$ is linked to a
particular kind of geometric hyperplane of the split Cayley hexagon of order
two, featuring 27 points located on 9 pairwise disjoint lines (a

that optimally emulates the examples, thus reproducing the unknown unitary
maximum fidelity. Learning a unitary is equivalent to storing it in the state
of a quantum memory (the memory of the learning machine), and subsequently
retrieving it. We prove that, whenever the unknown unitary is drawn from a

followed by a &quot;measure-and-rotate&quot; retrieving. Differing from the case of
quantum cloning, where the incoherent &quot;measure-and-prepare&quot; strategies are
typically suboptimal, in the case of learning the &quot;measure-and-rotate&quot; strategy
is optimal even when the learning machine is asked to reproduce a single copy

the &quot;measure-and-rotate&quot; strategies and applying our result to the optimal

levels in a large isolated quantum system, where all possible superpositions of
eigenstates are allowed, provided all these superpositions have the same fixed
energy. Such a condition is not equivalent to the conventional micro-canonical
condition, because the latter limits the participating eigenstates to a very
narrow energy window. The statistics is obtained analytically for both the
entire system and its small subsystem. In a significant departure from the
Boltzmann-Gibbs statistics, the average occupation numbers of quantum states
exhibit in the present case weak algebraic dependence on energy. In the
macroscopic limit, this dependence is routinely accompanied by the condensation
into the lowest energy quantum state. This work contains initial numerical
tests of the above statistics for finite systems, and also reports the
following numerical finding: When the basis states of large but finite random
matrix Hamiltonians are expanded in terms of eigenstates, the participation of
eigenstates in such an expansion obeys the newly obtained statistics. The above
statistics might be observable in small quantum systems, but for the
macroscopic systems, it rather reenforces doubts about self-sufficiency of
non-relativistic quantum mechanics for justifying the Boltzmann-Gibbs
equilibrium.

(QCLA) using measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), called MBQCLA. QCLA
was originally designed for an abstract, concurrent architecture supporting
long-distance communication, but most realistic architectures heavily constrain
communication distances. The quantum carry-lookahead adder is faster than a
quantum ripple-carry adder; QCLA has logarithmic depth while ripple adders have
linear depth. MBQCLA utilizes MBQC's ability to transfer quantum states in unit
time to accelerate addition. MBQCLA breaks the latency limit of addition
circuits in nearest neighbor-only architectures : compared to the $\Theta(n)$
limit on circuit depth for linear nearest-neighbor architectures, it can reach
$\Theta(log n)$ depth. MBQCLA is an order of magnitude faster than a
ripple-carry adder when adding registers longer than 100 qubits, but requires a
cluster state that is an order of magnitude larger. The cluster state resources
can be classified as computation and communication; for the unoptimized form,
$\approx$ 88 % of the resources are used for communication. Hand optimization
of horizontal communication costs results in a $\approx$ 12% reduction in
spatial resources for the in-place MBQCLA circuit. For comparison, a graph
state quantum carry-lookahead adder (GSQCLA) uses only $\approx$ 9 % of the
spatial resources of the MBQCLA.

the tunnel coupling between the dots and on the Pauli exclusion principle. As
such, this dephasing process is independent of spin-orbit coupling or hyperfine
interactions. The physical mechanism behind the dephasing is elastic phonon
scattering, which persists to much lower temperatures than real phonon-induced
transitions. Quantitative calculations performed for a lateral GaAs/AlGaAs
gate-defined double quantum dot yield micro-second dephasing times at
sub-Kelvin temperatures, which is consistent with experimental observations.

of the Casimir effect and experiments on measuring the Casimir force are
discussed. One of these problems is connected with the definition of the
Casimir free energy in ideal metal rectangular boxes satisfying the general
physical requirements. It is shown that the consideration of rectangular boxes
with a partition (piston) does not negate the previously known results obtained
for boxes without a piston. Both sets of results are found to be in mutual
agreement. Another problem is related to the use of the proximity force
approximation for the interpretation of the experimental data and to the search
of analytical results beyond the PFA based on the first principles of quantum
field theory. Next, we discuss concepts of experimental precision and of the
measure of agreement between experiment and theory. The fundamental difference
between these two concepts is clarified. Finally, recent approach to the
thermal Casimir force taking screening effects into account is applied to real
metals. It is shown that this approach is thermodynamically and experimentally
inconsistent. The physical reasons of this inconsistency are connected with the
violation of thermal equilibrium which is the basic applicability condition of
the Lifshitz theory.

singlet-triplet qubits in GaAs quantum dots. Given the considerably longer spin
coherence times measured in Si, considerable interest has been generated
recently in Si quantum dots. The physics of these systems is considerably more
complex than the physics of GaAs quantum dots owing to the presence of the
valley degree of freedom, which constitutes the focus of this work. In this
paper we investigate the physics of Si quantum dots and focus on the
feasibility of quantum coherent singlet-triplet qubit experiments analogous to
those performed in GaAs. This additional degree of freedom greatly increases
the complexity of the ground state and gives rise to highly nontrivial and
interesting physics in the processes of qubit initialization, coherent
manipulation and readout. We discuss the operational definition of a qubit in
Si-based quantum dots. We find that in the presence of valley degeneracy a
singlet-triplet qubit cannot be constructed, whereas for large valley splitting
(&gt;&gt;k_B*T) the experiment is similar to GaAs. We show that experiments on
singlet-triplet qubits analogous to those in GaAs would provide a method for
estimating the valley coupling in Si. A Zeeman field distinguishes between
different initialized states for any valley splitting and provides a tool to
determine the size of this splitting.

Casimir-Polder interactions in systems involving conducting plates has
attracted considerable attention in the recent literature on dispersion forces.
Alternative theoretical models, based on distinct low-frequency extrapolations
of the plates reflection coefficient for transverse electric (TE) modes,
provide widely different predictions for the magnitude of this correction. In
this paper we examine the most widely used prescriptions for this reflection
coefficient from the point of view of their consistency with the Bohr-van
Leeuwen theorem of classical statistical physics, stating that at thermal
equilibrium transverse electromagnetic fields decouple from matter in the
classical limit. We find that the theorem is satisfied if and only if the TE
reflection coefficient vanishes at zero frequency in the classical limit. This
criterion appears to rule out some of the models that have been considered
recently for describing the thermal correction to the Casimir pressure with
non-magnetic metallic plates.

  Computing</title><description>  Recently, several claims have been made that certain fundamental problems of
distributed computing, including Leader Election and Distributed Consensus,
begin to admit feasible and efficient solutions when the model of distributed
computation is extended so as to apply quantum processing. This has been
achieved in one of two distinct ways: (1) by initializing the system in a
quantum entangled state, and/or (2) by applying quantum communication channels.
In this paper, we explain why some of these prior claims are misleading, in the
sense that they rely on changes to the model unrelated to quantum processing.
On the positive side, we consider the aforementioned quantum extensions when
applied to Linial's well-established LOCAL model of distributed computing.
  For both types of extensions, we put forward valid proof-of-concept examples
of distributed problems whose round complexity is in fact reduced through
genuinely quantum effects, in contexts which do not depend on the anonymity of
nodes.
  Finally, we show that even the quantum variants of the LOCAL model have
non-trivial limitations, captured by a very simple (purely probabilistic)
notion which we call &quot;physical locality&quot; (PLOCAL). While this is strictly
weaker than the &quot;computational locality&quot; of the classical LOCAL model, it
nevertheless implies that for many distributed combinatorial optimization
problems, such as Maximal Independent Set, the best currently known lower time
bounds cannot be broken by applying quantum processing, in any conceivable way.

distant BECs be in EIT states and to generate an atom-photon entangled state
between probe lasers and distant BECs. The two BECs are initially in
un-entangled product coherent states while the probe lasers are initially in an

performing projective measurements upon the two outgoing probe lasers under
certain conditions. Concretely, we propose two protocols to show how to
generate entangled coherent states of the two distant BECs. One is a
single-photon scheme in which an entangled single-photon state serves the
quantum channel to generate entangled distant BECs. The other is a multiphoton
scheme where an entangled coherent state of the probe lasers is used as the

that non-trivial gravitational contributions to the relative position and

with the Ricci curvature tensor in the Fermi frame, indicating a formal
violation of the weak equivalence principle. Explicit expressions for these
contributions are shown for the case of quasi-circular orbital motion of a

Versraete, J. Dehaene, B. De Moor,

operations and classical communication (SLOCC), a pure state of four qubits can
be transformed to a state belonging to one of a set of nine families of states.
By using selective partial transposition, we construct partial K-way
negativities to measure the genuine 4-partite, tripartite, and bi-partite
entanglement of single copy states belonging to the nine families of four qubit
states. Partial K-way negativities are polynomial functions of local invariants
characterizing each family of states as such entanglement monotones.

path of nondegenerate eigenstates of a continuous family of Hamiltonians. We
introduce a method that traverses a discretized form of the path: At each step
we apply the instantaneous Hamiltonian for a random time. The resulting
decoherence approximates a projective measurement onto the desired eigenstate,
achieving a version of the quantum Zeno effect. If negative evolution times can
be implemented with constant overhead, then the average absolute evolution time
required by our method is O(L^2/Delta) for constant error probability, where L
is the length of the path of eigenstates and Delta is the minimum spectral gap
of the Hamiltonian. Making explicit the dependence on the path length is useful
for cases where L does not depend on Delta. The complexity of our method has a
logarithmic improvement over previous algorithms of this type. The same cost
applies to the discrete-time case, where a family of unitary operators is given
and each unitary and its inverse can be used. Restriction to positive evolution
times incurs an error that decreases exponentially with the cost. Applications
of this method to unstructured search and quantum sampling are considered. In
particular, we discuss the quantum simulated annealing algorithm for solving
combinatorial optimization problems. This algorithm provides a quadratic
speed-up in the gap of the stochastic matrix over its classical counterpart
implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo.

Phase fluctuations of the driving laser induce modulations of the linearized
opto-mechanical coupling as well as a fluctuating force on the mirror due to
variations of the mean cavity intensity. We first evaluate the influence of
both effects on cavity cooling and find that for a small laser linewidth the
dominant heating mechanism arises from intensity fluctuations. The resulting
limit on the final occupation number scales linearly with the cavity intensity
both under weak and strong coupling conditions. For the strong coupling regime,
we also determine the effect of phase noise on the coherent transfer of single
excitations between the cavity and the mechanical resonator and obtain a
similar conclusion. Our results show that conditions for optical ground state
cooling and coherent operations are experimentally feasible and thus laser
phase noise does pose a challenge but not a stringent limitation for
opto-mechanical systems.

In order to explain this, it is argued that histories of local number, momentum

these variables to exactly conserved quantities (which are exactly decoherent),

concepts of quantum field theory and uniting two main problems, durations of
delay at scattering and of formation of arisen states, seems evident.
  We show that the Ward-Takahashi identity allows the defining of general
temporal function in the frame of QED, real part of which describes the
duration of delay of scattered particle on scatterer and imaginary part
describes the duration of formation (&quot;dressing&quot;) of outgoing bare particle. The
functions of same form can be revealed in the known QED descriptions of
processes, i.e. they arise in the course of standard calculations, but are not
entered artificially. These functions submit to the operator of duration
determinable by the reciprocal analogue of the Schroedinger equation, operator
of which is canonically conjugated with Hamiltonian. Definition of temporal
functions leads to the developing of such kinetic theories: theory of optical
dispersion (with the decision of certain known paradoxes), theory of
multiphoton processes (definitions of their thresholds and saturations) and
theory of phase transitions (determination of general correlation radii and the
full system of critical indices). The determination of temporal functions

Like all other
quantities in the theory, the notion of time has to be introduced
&quot;relationally&quot;, by studying the behavior of some physical quantities in terms
of others chosen as a &quot;clock&quot;. We have recently introduced a consistent way of
defining time relationally in general relativity. When quantum mechanics is
formulated in terms of this new notion of time the resolution of the
measurement problem can be implemented via decoherence without the usual
pitfalls. The resulting theory has the same experimental results of ordinary
quantum mechanics, but every time an event is produced or a measurement happens
two alternatives are possible: a) the state collapses; b) the system evolves
without changing the state. One therefore has two possible behaviors of the
quantum mechanical system and physical observations cannot decide between them,
not just as a matter of experimental limitations but as an issue of principle.
This first-ever example of fundamental undecidability in physics suggests that
nature may behave sometimes as described by one alternative and sometimes as
described by another. This in particular may give new vistas on the issue of
free will.

propagating along a curved ray trajectory in a gradient-index dielectric
medium. A Coriolis-type term appears in Maxwell equations under transition to
the rotating coordinate system accompanying the ray. This term describes the
spin-orbit coupling of light which consists of (i) the Berry phase responsible
for a trajectory-dependent polarization variations and (ii) the spin Hall
effect representing polarization-dependent trajectory perturbations. These
mutual phenomena are described within universal geometrical structures
underlying the problem and are explained by the dynamics of the intrinsic
angular momentum carried by the wave. Such close geometro-dynamical
interrelations illuminate a dual physical nature of the phenomena.

  Processor</title><description>  By harnessing the superposition and entanglement of physical states, quantum
computers could outperform their classical counterparts in solving problems of
technological impact, such as factoring large numbers and searching databases.
A quantum processor executes algorithms by applying a programmable sequence of
gates to an initialized register of qubits, which coherently evolves into a
final state containing the result of the computation. Simultaneously meeting
the conflicting requirements of long coherence, state preparation, universal
gate operations, and qubit readout makes building quantum processors
challenging. Few-qubit processors have already been shown in nuclear magnetic
resonance, cold ion trap and optical systems, but a solid-state realization has
remained an outstanding challenge. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit
superconducting processor and the implementation of the Grover search and
Deutsch-Jozsa quantum algorithms. We employ a novel two-qubit interaction,
tunable in strength by two orders of magnitude on nanosecond time scales, which
is mediated by a cavity bus in a circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED)
architecture. This interaction allows generation of highly-entangled states
with concurrence up to 94%. Although this processor constitutes an important
step in quantum computing with integrated circuits, continuing efforts to
increase qubit coherence times, gate performance and register size will be
required to fulfill the promise of a scalable technology.

atomic magnetometer by double-passing a far-detuned laser field through the
atomic sample as it undergoes Larmor precession. Numerical simulations of the
quantum Fisher information suggest that, despite the lack of explicit
multi-body coupling terms in the system's magnetic Hamiltonian, the parameter
estimation uncertainty in such a physical setup scales better than the
conventional Heisenberg uncertainty limit over a specified but arbitrary range
of particle number N. Using the methods of quantum stochastic calculus and
filtering theory, we demonstrate numerically an explicit parameter estimator
(called a quantum particle filter) whose observed scaling follows that of our
calculated quantum Fisher information. Moreover, the quantum particle filter
quantitatively surpasses the uncertainty limit calculated from the quantum
Cramer-Rao inequality based on a magnetic coupling Hamiltonian with only
single-body operators. We also show that a quantum Kalman filter is
insufficient to obtain super-Heisenberg scaling, and present evidence that such
scaling necessitates going beyond the manifold of Gaussian atomic states.

susceptibility, a recently introduced quantum information theoretical measure.
Monitoring the finite-size scaling of the probability distribution of this
quantity as well as its average and typical values, we detect a
disorder-induced disappearance of criticality and the emergence of Griffiths
phases in this model. It is found that the fidelity susceptibility is not
self-averaging near the disorder-free quantum critical lines. At the Ising
critical point the fidelity susceptibility scales as a disorder-strength
independent stretched exponential of the system size, in contrast with the
quadratic scaling at the corresponding point in the disorder-free XY chain.
Along the line where the average anisotropy vanishes the fidelity
susceptibility appears to scale extensively, whereas in the disorder-free case
this point is quantum critical with quadratic finite-size scaling.

QSAT appropriately generalizes the NP-complete classical satisfiability (SAT)

complex potential of step function form. We concentrate on the limit of a weak
potential, in which the resulting arrival time distribution function is closely
related to the quantum-mechanical current. We first consider the analagous
classical arrival time problem involving an absorbing potential, and this sheds
some light on certain aspects of the quantum case. In the quantum case, we
review the path decomposition expansion (PDX), in which the propagator is
factored across a surface of constant time, so is very useful for potentials of
step function form. We use the PDX to derive the usual scattering wave
functions and the arrival time distribution function. This method gives a
direct and geometrically appealing account of known results (but also points
the way to how they can be extended to more general complex potentials). We use
these results to carry out a decoherent histories analysis of the arrival time
problem, taking advantage of a recently demonstrated connection between pulsed
measurements and complex potentials. We obtain very simple and plausible
expressions for the class operators (describing the amplitudes for crossing the
origin during intervals of time) and show that decoherence of histories is
obtained for a wide class of initial states (such as simple wave packets and
superpositions of wave packets). We find that the decoherent histories approach
gives results with a sensible classical limit that are fully compatible with
standard results on the arrival time problem. We also find some interesting
connections between backflow and decoherence.

frequently emerges as the probability for crossing the origin during a given
time interval is the current integrated over that time interval. This is
semiclassically correct but can be negative due to backflow. Here, we show that
this formula naturally arises in a decoherent histories analysis of the arrival
time problem. For a variety of initial states, we show that histories crossing
during different time intervals are approximately decoherent. Probabilities may
therefore be assigned and coincide with the standard formula (in a
semiclassical approximation), which is therefore positive for these states.
However, for initial states for which there is backflow, we show that there
cannot be decoherence of histories, so probabilities may not be assigned.

H. Bennett and G. Brassard in 1984 (BB84), describes how this is achieved by
transmitting individual qubits and exchanging classical authenticated
information. Any attempt to eavesdrop on the protocol introduces errors
detectable by the legitimate parties.
  This Licentiate Thesis studies the recently introduced EEQKD protocol which
builds on BB84. In EEQKD, the qubits sent individually in BB84 are entangled
and thus not directly available to an eavesdropper who is, in this protocol,
provided only one-by-one access to the transmission. The maximal information an
eavesdropper can gain using a straightforward intercept-resend (IR) attack, is
obtained for a given error rate. The secure key generation rate of EEQKD is
estimated in practical scenarios including qubit loss and quantum channel
noise. In addition, an exquisite vulnerability is exposed: For a particular
setting of qubit entanglement, paradoxically proving most useful in the face of
an IR attack, EEQKD reduces to BB84.

was shown that in the case of a transversely pumped single-mode cavity, the
atoms self-organize at either the even or the odd antinodes of the cavity mode,
given sufficient pump intensity, and hence spontaneously break a discrete
translational symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in multimode cavities the
self-organization brings the additional feature of continuous translational
symmetry breaking, via a variant of Brazovskii's transition, thus paving the
way for realizations of compliant lattices and associated phenomena, e.g.,
quantum melting, topological defects, frustration, glassiness, and even
supersolidity; such phenomena are absent in ultracold atomic systems when the
optical lattices are externally imposed. We apply a functional integral
approach to this many-body cavity QED system, which enables us, inter alia, to
calculate transition thresholds, explore fluctuations near this transition, and
determine how such fluctuations are manifest in the light emitted from the

interacting with a nuclear spin bath. Although in the limit of a very large
magnetic field the only decoherence mechanism is spectral diffusion due to
dipolar flip-flops of nuclear spins, with decreasing field the
hyperfine-mediated interactions between the nuclear spins become important. We
take advantage of their long-range nature, and resum the leading terms in an
1/N expansion of the decoherence time-evolution function (N, being the number
of nuclear spins interacting appreciably with the electron spin, is large). For
the case of the thermal uncorrelated bath we show that our theory is applicable
down to low magnetic fields (~10 mT for a large dot with N=10^6) allowing for
comparison with recent experiments in GaAs quantum dot spin qubits. Within this
approach we calculate the free induction decay and spin echo decoherence in
GaAs and InGaAs as a function of the number of the nuclei in the bath (i.e. the
quantum dot size) and the magnetic field. Our theory for free induction decay
in a narrowed nuclear bath is shown to agree with the exact solution for
decoherence due to hyperfine-mediated interaction which can be obtained when
all the nuclei-electron coupling constants are identical. For the spin echo
evolution we show that the dominant decoherence process at low fields is due to
interactions between nuclei having significantly different Zeeman energies
(i.e. nuclei of As and two isotopes of Ga in GaAs), and we compare our results
with recent measurements of spin echo signal of a single spin confined in a
GaAs quantum dot. For the same set of parameters we perform calculations of
decoherence under various dynamical decoupling pulse sequences, and predict the
effect of these sequences in low B regime in GaAs.

behavior similar to the GHZ and W states when one of the photons is not

  to a quantum bath</title><description>  A system put in contact with a large heat bath normally thermalizes. This
means that the state of the system approaches an equilibrium state, the latter
depending only on macroscopic characteristics of the bath (e.g. temperature),
but not on the initial state of the system. The above statement is the
cornerstone of the equilibrium statistical mechanics; its validity and its
domain of applicability are central questions in the studies of the foundations
of statistical mechanics. In the present paper we concentrate on one aspect of
thermalization, namely, on the system initial state independence (ISI) of the
equilibrium state. A necessary condition for the system ISI is derived in the
quantum framework. We use the derived condition to prove the absence of the
system ISI in a specific model. Namely, we consider a single spin coupled to a
large bath, the interaction being of a specific form. Although the model under
consideration is nontrivial enough to exhibit the decoherence and the approach
to equilibrium, the derived necessary condition is not fulfilled and thus the
equilibrium state depends on the initial state of the spin.

topological properties of systems, defined on two different arrangements of

lattice and on the square-octagonal lattice by the use of mapping into the spin
glass systems. The analysis for the corresponding spin glass systems consists
of the duality, and the gauge symmetry, which has succeeded in deriving
locations of special points, which are deeply related with the accuracy
thresholds of topological error correcting codes. We predict that the accuracy
thresholds for the topological color codes would be $1-p_c = 0.1096-8 $ for the
hexagonal lattice and $1-p_c = 0.1092-3$ for the square-octagonal lattice,
where $1-p$ denotes the error probability on each qubit. Hence both of them are
expected to be slightly lower than the probability $1-p_c = 0.110028$ for the
quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound with a zero encoding rate.

information processor A at time $t=0$ is exactly equal to that in another
processor B at a later time. We demonstrate that there always exists a complete
set of orthogonal states, which can be employed to perform the exact state
transmission. Our result is very general in the sense that it holds for
arbitrary media between the two processors and for any time interval. We
illustrate our results in terms of models of spin, fermionic and bosonic

transfer, which is associated with degenerated subspaces of this set of states.
Interestingly, this formalism leads to a proposal of perfect state transfer via
adiabatic passage, which does not depend on the specific form of the driving

  master equations, reservoir-induced interactions and decoherence</title><description>  In this paper we analyze the double Caldeira-Leggett model: the path integral
approach to two interacting dissipative harmonic oscillators. Assuming a
general form of the interaction between the oscillators, we consider two
different situations: i) when each oscillator is coupled to its own reservoir,
and ii) when both oscillators are coupled to a common reservoir. After deriving
and solving the master equation for each case, we analyze the decoherence
process of particular entanglements in the positional space of both
oscillators. To analyze the decoherence mechanism we have derived a general
decay function for the off-diagonal peaks of the density matrix, which applies
both to a common and separate reservoirs. We have also identified the expected
interaction between the two dissipative oscillators induced by their common
reservoir. Such reservoir-induced interaction, which gives rise to interesting
collective damping effects, such as the emergence of relaxation- and
decoherence-free subspaces, is shown to be blurred by the high-temperature
regime considered in this study. However, we find that different interactions
between the dissipative oscillators, described by rotating or counter-rotating
terms, result in different decay rates for the interference terms of the
density matrix.

very strong back reaction to metric and break the black hole horizon. As a

quantum scattering: the stationary phase method and its relation with delay
times for relativistic and non-relativistic tunneling particles. We notice that
the applicability of this method is constrained by several subtleties in
deriving the phase time that describes the localization of scattered wave
packets. We investigate the general relation between phase times and dwell
times for quantum tunneling/scattering. Considering a symmetrical collision of
two identical wave packets with an one-dimensional barrier, we demonstrate that
these two distinct transit time definitions are explicitly connected. The
traversal times are obtained for a symmetrized (two identical bosons) and an
antisymmetrized (two identical fermions) quantum colliding configuration.
Multiple wave packet decomposition shows us that the phase time (group delay)
describes the exact position of the scattered particles and, in addition to the
exact relation with the dwell time, leads to correct conceptual understanding
of both transit time definitions. At last, we extend the non-relativistic
formalism to the solutions for the tunneling zone of a one-dimensional
electrostatic potential in the relativistic (Dirac to Klein-Gordon) wave
equation where the incoming wave packet exhibits the possibility of being
almost totally transmitted through the potential barrier. The conditions for
the occurrence of accelerated tunneling transmission probabilities are all
quantified and the problematic superluminal interpretation based on the
non-relativistic tunneling dynamics is revisited.

dynamic parameter of distribution and formally equalized with other
coordinates. Also the meaning of the energy-momentum distribution is clarified.
Conditions of such distributions observation are described. As applied to the
quantum field these structures are transformed into new characteristics of
particles distribution in space-time in addition to those for momentum states.
Their operators for free fields are obtained. Under such model the Heisenberg's
uncertainty relations are grounded for the relativistic particle; both
particles and antiparticles turn out to be different states of a single
particle; vacuum state of boson quantum field has zero energy.

wavelike phenomena such as the diffraction of light. Moreover, wave-particle
duality implies that all quantum objects can exhibit coherence, and this
quantum coherence is crucial to understanding the behaviour of a plethora of
systems.
  In this article, which is written at an undergraduate level, we shall briefly
introduce what is meant by coherence in a well-known classical setting, before
going on to describe its quantum version. We will show that coherence is
important in describing the properties of solid-state nanosystems, and
especially quantum dots. Simple experiments that reveal the coherent nature of
matter - and how this leads to some very powerful applications - will be
described. Finally, we shall discuss the fragility of coherence and shall
introduce a method for describing decoherence in open quantum systems.

concepts in metrology in particular for resolution improvements in different
methods of quantum imaging. Since Fock-states of N-photons of wavelength lambda
in interference schemes acquire N-times the phase shift of single photons these
states can appear as if they had a de Broglie wavelength of lambda/N. A
biphoton beam diffracted at a blazed grating shows this reduced de Broglie
wavelength. This experiment can be seen as a purification of biphotons of a
certain correlation strength on the one hand. On the other hand the evaluation
of the one-photon and two-photon rate distributions in the Fraunhofer far field
of the grating allows for an analysis of the spatial correlation between the
photons. An experimental demonstration of these ideas tested for a biphoton
beam generated by parametric down conversion (PDC) is reported. We demonstrate
in addition that the existence of higher order spatial modes is important to
observe strong spatial correlations and to observe the photonic de Broglie
wavelength of lambda/2 for biphotons.

supports of arguments of response functions (e.g. light cone, borders of media)

dispersion relations, theorems of counting, etc. As supports are measurable,
their absolutely strict borders contradict the spirit of quantum theory and
their quantum evolution leading to appearance of subtractions or certain needed
flattening would be considered. Flattening of projectors introduce transitive
zones that can be examined as a specification of adiabatic hypothesis or the
Bogoliubov regulatory function in QED. For demonstration of their possibilities

broken internal symmetries to gauge transformations to the equations of

theory is constructed exactly as if it were a representational form of an
underlying theory. Our proposed form for the underlying theory is that it is
based on a linear equation, OF(V)=0. F is a function of some set of
independent, currently unknown variables V, with O being a linear, partial
differential operator in those variables. The operator is assumed to be
invariant under a group of transformations of the Vs, homomorphic to the direct

and relativistic quantum mechanics, and in quantum electrodynamics. More
specifically, this work starts dealing with: (i) the maximal hermitian (but not
selfadjoint) Time operator in non-relativistic quantum mechanics and in quantum
electrodynamics; and with: (ii) the problem of the four-position and
four-momentum operators, each one with its hermitian and anti-hermitian parts,
for relativistic spin-zero particles. Afterwards, other physically important
applications of non-selfadjoint (and even non-hermitian) operators are
discussed: In particular, (iii) we reanalyze in detail the interesting
possibility of associating quasi-hermitian Hamiltonians with (decaying)
unstable states in nuclear physics. Finally, we briefly mention the cases of
quantum dissipation, as well as of the nuclear optical potential. [PACS

a harmonic oscillator in a parameter regime where the underlying classical
dynamics exhibits an unstable equilibrium point. This state of the model is
relevant to the physics of cold atom systems, in non-equilibrium situations
obtained by fast sweeping through a Feshbach resonance. We show that in this
integrable system with two degrees of freedom, for any initial condition close
to the unstable point, the classical dynamics is controlled by a singularity of
the focus-focus type. In particular, it displays the expected monodromy, which
forbids the existence of global action-angle coordinates. Explicit calculations
of the joint spectrum of conserved quantities reveal the monodromy at the
quantum level, as a dislocation in the lattice of eigenvalues. We perform a
detailed semi-classical analysis of the associated eigenstates. Whereas most of
the levels are well described by the usual Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rules,
properly adapted to polar coordinates, we show how these rules are modified in
the vicinity of the critical level. The spectral decomposition of the
classically unstable state is computed, and is found to be dominated by the
critical WKB states. This provides a useful tool to analyze the quantum
dynamics starting from this particular state, which exhibits an aperiodic
sequence of solitonic pulses with a rather well defined characteristic
frequency.

  Rb vapors</title><description>  We present experimental and theoretical analysis of quantum fluctuation in a
vacuum field in the presence of orthogonal linearly polarized pump field
propagating through a Rb vapor cell. Previously reported theoretical and
experimental studies provided somewhat contradictory conclusions regarding the
possibility to observe the &quot;squeezed vacuum&quot; -- the reduction of vacuum
fluctuations below standard quantum limit -- in this system. Here, using the D1
transitions of Rb in a cell without buffer as as an example, we demonstrate
that vacuum squeezing is corrupted by incoherent processes (such as spontaneous
emission, elastic scattering, etc.), and its observation is only possible in a
specific small region of the experimental parameter space. Numerical
simulations, in good agreement with the experiment, demonstrate that the two
excited state hyperfine levels play a crucial role in the squeezing and excess
noise production. The significant influence of far-detuned atoms on the field
fluctuations at low noise frequencies imposes the explicit consideration of the
full velocity distribution of the atomic vapor.

of cavity QED. These schemes work in a completely deterministic way and are
based on the resonant interaction of the atoms in a chain with a bimodal cavity

2xN cluster state can be generated efficiently with only a single bimodal
cavity, while two such cavities are needed in order to construct a 3xN cluster
state. It is shown, moreover, how these schemes can be extended towards the
generation of MxN two-dimensional cluster states.

for a two-level atom, interacting with the electromagnetic field, placed near
an infinite perfectly conducting wall. We solve iteratively the Heisenberg
equations for the field operators and obtain the electric and magnetic energy
density operators around the atom (valid for any initial state). Then we
explicitly evaluate them for an initial state with the atom in its bare ground
state and the field in the vacuum state. We show that the results can be
physically interpreted as the superposition of the fields propagating directly
from the atom and the fields reflected on the wall. Relativistic causality in
the field propagation is discussed. Finally we apply these results to the
calculation of the dynamical Casimir-Polder interaction energy in the far zone
between two atoms when a boundary condition such as a conducting wall is
present. Magnetic contributions to the interatomic Casimir-Polder interaction
in the presence of the wall are also considered. We show that, in the limit of

While part of the long simulation time is due to the use of the light-cone

numerical stability, and we describe how to incorporate symmetry into this

  asymptotics of photoeffect</title><description>  We investigate the total effect of correlations on photoionization of atomic
shells with nonzero orbital momentum, in the nonrelativistic high energy
asymptotic limit, considering the exclusive case of the dominant final state of
an initial neutral atom. We find that the substantial cancellation of the
dominant intra-shell carrelations, which had been reported earlier, can be
understood utilizing the closure properties satisfied by the eigen functions of
the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian. Considering the sum of correlations with all
states, occupied or not, we show that complete sum is equal to the contribution
of the high energy part of the continuum. Consequently there is a total
cancellation between the contributions of the bound states and the low energy
part of the continuum states. This means that the real correlations in the
physical atom can be obtained as the negative of the total contribution of low
energy states and continuum unoccupied states. We calculate this in framework
of the quantum defect number. The approach allows us to see that the dominant
intrashell correlation is going to be cancelled. We can also obtain some limits
on the correlation effects by considering calculations with the screened
Coulomb functions. The role of correlations in the exclusive photoionization
processes is discussed.

initial state, transitions to other states are hindered and the quantum Zeno
effect takes place. However, in its broader formulation, the quantum Zeno
effect does not necessarily freeze everything. On the contrary, for frequent
projections onto a multidimensional subspace, the system can evolve away from
its initial state, although it remains in the subspace defined by the
measurement. The continuing time evolution within the projected &quot;quantum Zeno
subspace&quot; is called &quot;quantum Zeno dynamics:&quot; for instance, if the measurements
ascertain whether a quantum particle is in a given spatial region, the
evolution is unitary and the generator of the Zeno dynamics is the Hamiltonian
with hard-wall (Dirichlet) boundary conditions. We discuss the physical and
mathematical aspects of this evolution, highlighting the open mathematical
problems. We then analyze some alternative strategies to obtain a Zeno dynamics
and show that they are physically equivalent.

  Cats and Crossing of Classical Orbits</title><description>  Nuclei are rather classical systems in a sense. In the old days, their
phenomena were roughly explained in classical rules such as the liquid drop
model. This fact may be understood that when we see an finite quantum many body
system like nucleus, though which is a group of quantum mechanical particles,
its any collective degree of freedom has any classicality. Getting a
classicality does not depend on spatial scales of objects. It is made by a
phenomenon called Quantum Decoherence. We have studied about Quantum
Decoherence in a finite system as nucleus. In this paper, at the harmonic three
body problem (3 Schroedinger cats), it is shown that one degree of freedom as a
sub-system would get classicality because of the other two degrees of freedom.
Therefore we can assume that a nuclear collective degree of freedom would get
classicality when it couples with any other internal degrees of freedom. In
this paper, we also note that there is some relationship between the Quantum
Decoherence and Crossing of classical orbits in 3 Schroedinger cats model.

communication (QDC) protocols with authentication are vulnerable under some
specific attacks, and the secrete message will leak out to the authenticator
who is introduced to authenticate users participating in the communication. We
then propose a new protocol that is capable of achieving secure QDC with
authentication as long as the authenticator would do the authentication job
faithfully. Our quantum protocol introduces a mutual authentication procedure,
uses the quantum Bell states, and applies unitary transformations in the
authentication process. Then it exploits and utilizes the entanglement swapping
and local unitary operations in the communication processes. Thus, after the
authentication process, the client users are left alone to communicate with
each other, and the authenticator has no access to the secrete message. In
addition, our protocol does not require a direct quantum link between any two
users, who want to communicate with each other. This may also be an appealing
advantage in the implementation of a practical quantum communication network.

through the photosynthetic antenna display quantal features, aspects known from
the dynamics of charge carriers along polymer backbones. Hence, in modeling
energy transfer one has to leave the classical, master-equation-type formalism
and advance towards an increasingly quantum-mechanical picture, while still
retaining a local description of the complex network of molecules involved in
the transport, say through a tight-binding approach.
  Interestingly, the continuous time random walk (CTRW) picture, widely
employed in describing transport in random environments, can be mathematically
reformulated to yield a quantum-mechanical Hamiltonian of tight-binding type;
the procedure uses the mathematical analogies between time-evolution operators
in statistical and in quantum mechanics: The result are continuous-time quantum
walks (CTQWs). However, beyond these formal analogies, CTRWs and CTQWs display
vastly different physical properties. In particular, here we focus on trapping
processes on a ring and show, both analytically and numerically, that distinct
configurations of traps (ranging from periodical to random) yield strongly
different behaviours for the quantal mean survival probability, while
classically (under ordered conditions) we always find an exponential decay at
long times.

the entanglement is typically destroyed faster than for single reservoirs.
Surprisingly however, the existence of separate reservoirs can also have a
beneficial entangling effect: if the qubits are coupled and driven externally

a finite degree of entanglement. This phenomenon occurs only in a certain

corresponding to an arbitrary sparse classical random walk. Our approach is
based on Grover and Rudolph's method for preparing coherent versions of
efficiently integrable probability distributions. This method is intended for
use in quantum walk algorithms with polynomial speedups, whose complexity is
usually measured in terms of how many times we have to apply a step of a
quantum walk, compared to the number of necessary classical Markov chain steps.
We consider a finer notion of complexity including the number of elementary
gates it takes to implement each step of the quantum walk with some desired
accuracy. The difference in complexity for various implementation approaches is
that our method scales linearly in the sparsity parameter and
poly-logarithmically with the inverse of the desired precision. The best
previously known general methods either scale quadratically in the sparsity
parameter, or polynomially in the inverse precision. Our approach is especially
relevant for implementing quantum walks corresponding to classical random walks
like those used in the classical algorithms for approximating permanents and
sampling from binary contingency tables. In those algorithms, the sparsity
parameter grows with the problem size, while maintaining high precision is
required.

are then solved to second order in perturbation theory which, in rotating-wave
approximation, yields the standard effective interaction Hamiltonian known from
free-space nonlinear optics. In a second step, we derive the local-field
corrected Hamiltonian for an atom embedded in a dielectric host medium, i.e. a
nonlinear crystal. Here we show that the resulting effective Hamiltonian is
trilinear in the electric and noise polarization fields, and is thus capable of
describing nonlinear noise processes. Furthermore, it reduces to the
phenomonological nonlinear Hamiltonian for the cases where the noise
polarization field, and hence absorption, vanishes.

approximately localized, leaving an exponential tail. We show that one may

photons, and only momentarily. In the course of time evolution this

discriminating thermal and identity channels by comparing their M-copy error
probability bounds. This offers us a simplified mathematical analysis for
quantum target detection with slightly modified features: the object -- if it
is present -- perfectly reflects the signal beam irradiating it, while thermal
noise photons are returned to the receiver in its absence. This model
facilitates us to obtain analytic results on error-probability bounds i.e., the
quantum Chernoff bound and the lower bound constructed from the Bhattacharya
bound on M-copy discrimination error-probabilities of some important quantum
states, like photon number states, N00N states, coherent states and the
entangled photons obtained from spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC).
Comparing the $M$-copy error-bounds, we identify that N00N states indeed offer
enhanced sensitivity than the photon number state system, when average signal
photon number is small compared to the thermal noise level. However, in the
high signal-to-noise scenario, N00N states fail to be advantageous than the
photon number states. Entangled SPDC photon pairs too outperform conventional
coherent state system in the low signal-to-noise case. On the other hand,
conventional coherent state system surpasses the performance sensitivity
offered by entangled photon pair, when the signal intensity is much above that
of thermal noise. We find an analogous performance regime in the lossy target
detection (where the target is modeled as a weakly reflecting object) in a high

birth (ESB) of the two reservoirs occurs without certain symmetry with respect

resonances can be verified as the resonances which survive only outside the
cavity in the small opening limit of the dielectric disk. We have confirmed
that the outer resonances universally exist in deformed cavities irrespective
of the geometry of cavity and they split into nearly degenerate states in
slightly deformed cavity. Also we pointed out that the effective potential
analogy is inapplicable to the description of outer resonances. Since most
outer resonances in the dielectric cavities have quite high leakages, they
would affect to the broad background in the density of states. Especially, for
TE polarization case, relatively low-leaky outer resonances exist and it
presents the possibility that they can interact with the inner resonances and

usual QKD, the security of DIQKD follows from the laws of quantum physics, but
contrary to usual QKD, it does not rely on any assumptions about the internal
working of the quantum devices used in the protocol. We present here in detail
the security proof for a DIQKD protocol introduced in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 98,
230501 (2008)]. This proof exploits the full structure of quantum theory (as
opposed to other proofs that exploit the no-signalling principle only), but
only holds again collective attacks, where the eavesdropper is assumed to act
on the quantum systems of the honest parties independently and identically at
each round of the protocol (although she can act coherently on her systems at
any time). The security of any DIQKD protocol necessarily relies on the

the case in which the boundary is a fractal. We consider the topologically
ordered phase of the toric code with a magnetic field. When the field vanishes
it is possible to analytically compute the entanglement entropy for both
regular and fractal bipartitions $(A,B)$ of the system, and this yields an
upper bound for the entire topological phase. When the $A$-$B$ boundary is
regular we have $S/p =1$ for large $p$. When the boundary is a fractal of
Hausdorff dimension $D$, we show that the entanglement between the two parts

various quantum channel capacities. Here, we construct a family of channels
with sharply bounded classical, hence private capacity. On the other hand,
their quantum capacity when combined with a zero private (and zero quantum)
capacity erasure channel, becomes larger than the previous classical capacity.
  As a consequence, we can conclude for the first time that the classical
private capacity is non-additive. In fact, in our construction even the quantum
capacity of the tensor product of two channels can be greater than the sum of
their individual classical private capacities.
  We show that this violation occurs quite generically: every channel can be

classical capacity.

other reported diffusion. The classical systems are chaotic, and exhibit normal
diffusive behavior. In the quantum systems, we found different regimes,
depending on the strength of the coupling. For weak coupling, we found quantum
localization similar to that exhibited by single kicked rotors. For strong
coupling, we found a quasi-diffusive growth of the width of the momentum
distribution, in which the apparent diffusion coefficient decreased as time
increased. The behavior in this regime can be described by the scaling theory
of weak localization for two-dimensional disordered lattices. The weak and

enable nonlinear optical switching at a single photon level, and implement
functional nodes of a quantum network, where the emitters serve as processing

separable and nonseparable, that (i) admit an LHV description under any
bipartite measurements with two settings per site; (ii) do not necessarily

Wigner's formulation makes no mention of the Weyl-Heisenberg group and the

  transition</title><description>  Single crystal silicon is an excellent system in which to explore dynamic
nuclear polarization (DNP), as it exhibits a continuum of properties from
metallic to insulating as a function of doping concentration and temperature.
At low doping concentrations DNP has been observed to occur via the solid
effect, while at very high doping concentrations an Overhauser mechanism is
responsible. Here we report the hyperpolarization of 29Si in n-doped silicon
crystals, with doping concentrations in the range of 1-3 x 10^17 /cc. In this
regime exchange interactions between donors become extremely important. The
sign of the enhancement in our experiments and its frequency dependence suggest
that the 29Si spins are directly polarized by donor electrons via an Overhauser
mechanism within exchange-coupled donor clusters. The exchange interaction
between donors only needs to be larger than the silicon hyperfine interaction
(typically much smaller than the donor hyperfine coupling) to enable this
Overhauser mechanism. Nuclear polarization enhancement is observed for a range
of donor clusters in which the exchange energy is comparable to the donor
hyperfine interaction. The DNP dynamics are characterized by a single
exponential time constant that depends on the microwave power, indicating that
the Overhauser mechanism is the rate-limiting step. Since only about 2 % of the
silicon nuclei are located within one Bohr radius of the donor electron,
nuclear spin diffusion is important in transferring the polarization to all the
spins. However, the spin-diffusion time is much shorter than the Overhauser
time due to the relatively weak silicon hyperfine coupling strength. In a 2.35
T magnetic field at 1.1 K, we observed a DNP enhancement of $244 +/- 84
resulting in a silicon polarization of $10.4 +/- 3.4 % following two hours of
microwave irradiation.

non-unitary matrix elements interaction. We particularize to the case of a
quantum optical Ramsey interferometer. We show that using purity swapping, a
perfect interference pattern can be obtained at the output port of the
interferometer even if we start from totally unpolarized sources. This feature
is shown to be associated with the phenomena of recreation of the state vector

is robust against degradation of the purity of the qubit input state. We also
show that the Tsallis entropy T2 is a useful entanglement monotone allowing one
to relate directly entanglement with purity exchange in interacting systems. We
conjecture an Araki-Lieb type inequality for T2 that bounds the maximum

quantum theory are expectation values of a complete orthogonal set of
projection operators. This rule works for single laboratory settings in which
the observer can distinguish all the different possible outcomes corresponding
to the projection operators. However, theories of inflation suggest that the
universe may be so large that any laboratory, no matter how precisely it is
defined by its internal state, may exist in a large number of very distantly
separated copies throughout the vast universe. In this case, no observer within
the universe can distinguish all possible outcomes for all copies of the
laboratory. Then normalized probabilities for the local outcomes that can be
locally distinguished cannot be given by the expectation values of any
projection operators. Thus the Born rule dies and must be replaced by another
rule for observational probabilities in cosmology. The freedom of what this new
rule is to be is the measure problem in cosmology. A particular volume-averaged
form is proposed.

facet-inducing for the respective classical correlation polytope. Stronger

An epistemologicalphysical, strictly qualitative discipline, IQM (infra-quantum
mechanics), is constructed independently of the mathematical formalism of QM.
IQM emerges under exclusively the constraints imposed by: the cognitive
situation of a human being who decides to construct communicable and consensual
knowledge on microstates; general requirements of human conceptualization. IMQ
brings into evidence how the mathematical formalism of QM manages to signify.
It explicates an integrated expression of a radically new type of descriptional
form, transferred on the registering devices of macroscopic apparatuses and
primordially statistical. IMQ is then considered globally and its relations
with space, time, geometry, consensus, as well as with Einstein's theories, are
specified. It appears that: there exists an order of progressive
constructability of our conceptualizations of physical reality; this order
withstands inclusion of concepts constructed inside macroscopic physics, into
the primordial transferred representation of microstates; consequently the aim
of directly unifying Einstein's theories, with QM, appears to be impossible.
Bell's theorem on locality expresses exclusively this impossibility. Causality
appears to be a modelizing concept that cannot be implemented into our
primordial representations of physical entities.

systems where each subsystem can have different degrees of freedom (so-called
qudits). One set, called 'separability' measure, reveals which of the
subsystems are separable/entangled. For that we have to extend the concept of
k-separability for multipartite systems to a novel unambiguous separability
concept which we call \gamma_k-separability. The second set of entanglement
measures reveals the 'kind' of entanglement, i.e. if it is bipartite,
tripartite, ..., n-partite entangled and is denoted as the 'physical' measure.
We show how lower bounds on both sets of measures can be obtained by the
observation that any entropy may be rewritten via operational expressions known
as m-concurrences. Moreover, for different classes of bipartite or multipartite
qudit systems we compute the bounds explicitly and discover that they are often
tight or equivalent to positive partial transposition (PPT).

perpendicular to tunneling a fraction of the electron state is waves
propagating away from the barrier. When the tangent momentum is zero a mutual
interference of the waves results in an exponentially small outgoing flux. The
finite tangent momentum destroys the interference due to formation of caustics
by the waves. As a result, a significant fraction of the prebarrier density is
carried away from the barrier providing a not exponentially small penetration
even through an almost classical barrier. The total electron energy is well
below the barrier.

apparatuses don't enforce one result or another in measurements, but only
reveal pre-existent values of properties of the measured systems. However, it
is shown here that if factors situated at a distance from a system are assumed
to influence the system response to measurements, the wave function may be not
unique. It's the macroscopic objects that pick one wave function from the
different possible wave functions. So, their influence on the results cannot be

variety of systems, for example to single electrons by electrostatic or
magnetic coupling, and to photons by radiation pressure or optical dipole
forces. So far, all such experiments have operated in a regime of weak
coupling, in which reversible energy exchange between the mechanical device and
its coupled partner is suppressed by fast decoherence of the individual systems
to their local environments. Controlled quantum experiments are in principle
not possible in such a regime, but instead require strong coupling. So far,
this has been demonstrated only between microscopic quantum systems, such as
atoms and photons (in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics) or solid
state qubits and photons. Strong coupling is an essential requirement for the
preparation of mechanical quantum states, such as squeezed or entangled states,
and also for using mechanical resonators in the context of quantum information

of optomechanical normal mode splitting, which provides unambiguous evidence

distribution, a k-design. k-designs have the first k moments equal to those of
the Haar distribution. The advantage of this is that (approximate) k-designs
can be implemented efficiently, whereas Haar random unitaries cannot. We find
large deviation bounds for unitaries chosen from a k-design and then illustrate
this general technique with three applications. We first show that the von
Neumann entropy of a pseudo-random state is almost maximal. Then we show that,
if the dynamics of the universe produces a k-design, then suitably sized
subsystems will be in the canonical state, as predicted by statistical
mechanics. Finally we show that pseudo-random states are useless for
measurement based quantum computation.

treatment of a one-dimensional motion of a particle in the Calogero potential
$\alpha x^{-2}$. Although the problem is quite old and well-studied, we believe
that our consideration, based on a uniform approach to constructing a correct
quantum-mechanical description for systems with singular potentials and/or

mathematical accuracy, we discuss some &quot;paradoxes&quot; inherent in the &quot;naive&quot;
quantum-mechanical treatment. We study all possible self-adjoint operators
(self-adjoint Hamiltonians) associated with a formal differential expression
for the Calogero Hamiltonian. In addition, we discuss a spontaneous
scale-symmetry breaking associated with self-adjoint extensions. A complete

  characteristic function representation</title><description>  A characteristic function (CF) based formalism for the representation of
quantum optical operations pertaining to the Continuous Variable (CV) quantum
teleportation protocol for general resource and input states is introduced;
allowing for modifications of basic CV teleportation; such as lossy homodyne
measurements and the presence of thermal noise. The output state CF is given as
a product of the CFs of resource and input. The use of non-Gaussian resources
is studied by means of a general class of two-mode squeezed Bell-like states
that include as special cases Gaussian, non-Gaussian and &quot;degaussified&quot;
resources; it is shown that Bell-like resources optimized (&quot;tailored&quot;) for
maximum fidelity yield a remarkable improvement in fidelity of teleportation
for the studied input states. A further generalization is introduced with
two-mode squeezed superpositions of Fock states including finite truncations of
Gaussian states as special cases; it is shown that the optimization for maximum
fidelity reduces these resources to truncated Gaussian states. Another class of
non-Gaussian resources is introduced, optimized squeezed cat-like states; their
performance is shown to be higher than that of a Gaussian state; but lower than
that for the Bell-like states. It is shown that the optimal non-Gaussian
resources are those that most closely realize the simultaneous maximization of
the entanglement, the affinity with the two-mode squeezed vacuum and the
(suitably measured) amount of non-Gaussianity. The teleportation of coherent
state inputs is studied using squeezed Bell-like and squeezed cat-like states
superimposed over Gaussian modes representing thermal noise; it is shown that
the optimized non-Gaussian resources are more robust in the presence of noise
then Gaussian resources.

generalised Pauli/Dirac groups and certain finite geometries. Here, we
succeeded in finding a general unifying framework for all these relations. We
introduce gradually necessary and sufficient conditions to be met in order to
carry out the following programme: Given a group $\vG$, we first construct
vector spaces over $\GF(p)$, $p$ a prime, by factorising $\vG$ over appropriate
normal subgroups. Then, by expressing $\GF(p)$ in terms of the commutator
subgroup of $\vG$, we construct alternating bilinear forms, which reflect
whether or not two elements of $\vG$ commute. Restricting to $p=2$, we search
for ``refinements'' in terms of quadratic forms, which capture the fact whether
or not the order of an element of $\vG$ is $\leq 2$. Such
factor-group-generated vector spaces admit a natural reinterpretation in the
language of symplectic and orthogonal polar spaces, where each point becomes a
``condensation'' of several distinct elements of $\vG$. Finally, several
well-known physical examples (single- and two-qubit Pauli groups, both the real
and complex case) are worked out in detail to illustrate the fine traits of the
formalism.

based on silicon double quantum dot physical qubits. Our design accounts for
constraints imposed by supporting classical electronics. A significant
consequence of the constraints is to add error-prone idle steps for the
physical qubits. Even using a schedule with provably minimum idle time, for our
noise model and choice of error-correction code, we find that these additional
idles negate any benefits of error correction. Using additional qubit
operations, we can greatly suppress idle-induced errors, making error
correction beneficial, provided the qubit operations achieve an error rate less
than $2 \times 10^{-5}$. We discuss other consequences of these constraints
such as error-correction code choice and physical qubit operation speed. While
our analysis is specific to this memory architecture, the methods we develop
are general enough to apply to other architectures as well.

decoupling consists of applying a sequence of Hahn spin-echo pulses. Recent
studies have shown that, in certain noise environments, judicious choice of the
delay times between these pulses can greatly improve the suppression of phase
errors compared to traditional approaches. By enforcing a simple analytical
condition, we obtain sets of dynamical decoupling sequences that are designed
for optimized noise filtration and are spectrum-independent up to a single
scaling factor set by the coherence time of the system. We demonstrate the
efficacy of these sequences in suppressing phase errors through measurements on
a model qubit system, $^{9}$Be$^{+}$ ions in a Penning trap. Our combined
theoretical and experimental studies show that in high-frequency-dominated
noise environments this approach may suppress phase errors orders of magnitude
more efficiently than comparable techniques can.

from a mixed-state, or hazy, environment, but the storage capacity of an
environment fragment is suppressed by its initial entropy. In the case of good
decoherence, the mutual information between the system and the fragment is
given solely by the fragment's entropy increase. For fairly mixed environments,
this means a reduction by a factor 1-h, where h is the haziness of the

hazy environments eventually reveal the state of the system, although now the

The storage medium is a vapor and the different spectral components of the
incoming signal are stored in different atomic velocity classes. One uses
appropriate pulses to reverse the resulting Doppler phase shift and to
regenerate the signal, without distortion, in the backward direction. The
different stages of the protocol are detailed and the recovery efficiency is
calculated in the semi-classical picture. Since the memory bandwidth is
determined by the Raman transition Doppler width, it can be adjusted by
changing the angle of the signal and control beams. The optical depth also
depends on the beam angle. As a consequence the available optical depth can be
optimized, depending on the needed bandwidth. The predicted recovery efficiency

renormalization, can give rise to finite observable effects. One way of
understanding how these effects arise is to compute the vacuum energy in an
idealized system such as a large cavity divided into disjoint regions by
pistons. In this paper, this type of calculation is carried out for situations
where the potential affecting a field is not the same in all regions of the
cavity. It is shown that the observable parts of the vacuum energy in such
potentials do not fall off to zero as the region where the potential is
nontrivial becomes large. This unusual behavior might be interesting for tests

in contrast with the conventional employment of a bi-orthogonal basis that
precludes probabilistic interpretation, since wave functions of resonant states
diverge exponentially in space. On the other hand, resonant states decay
exponentially in time, because momentum leaks out of the central scattering
area. This momentum leakage is also the reason for the spatial exponential
divergence of resonant state. It is by combining the opposite temporal and
spatial behaviors of resonant states that we arrive at our probabilistic
interpretation of these states. The physical need to normalize resonant wave
functions over an expanding spatial domain arises because particles leak out of
the region which contains the potential range and escape to infinity, and one

observable, but too small to serve as a realistic probe of the existence of
extra dimensions. We also examine the effect of the compactification on the
widths of spectral lines, and find that there is a small line narrowing effect.
This effect is also small for compactification well above the Planck scale, but
might serve as a test of the existence of extra dimensions.

an important class of noisy channels, namely the Pauli maps, these bounds
coincide and thus provide the exact analytical expression for the entanglement

depolarized to some graph-diagonal state, our method provides a lower bound for
the entanglement decay of any arbitrary state. Finally, this formalism also

quantum information and entanglement theory we extend a recently introduced
method and construct a general, self-contained theory of ground state
factorization in frustration free quantum spin models defined on lattices in
any spatial dimension and for interactions of arbitrary range. We show that,
quite generally, non exactly solvable translationally invariant models in
presence of an external uniform magnetic field can admit exact, fully
factorized ground state solutions. Unentangled ground states occur at finite
values of the Hamiltonian parameters satisfying well defined balancing
conditions between the applied field and the interaction strengths. These
conditions are analytically determined together with the type of magnetic
orderings compatible with factorization and the corresponding values of the
fundamental observables such as energy and magnetization. The method is applied
to a series of examples of increasing complexity, including
translationally-invariant models with short, long, and infinite ranges of
interaction, as well as systems with spatial anisotropies, in low and higher

series of novel exact results for complex models in any dimension, recovers, as
particular cases, the results previously achieved on simple models in low
dimensions exploiting direct methods based on factorized mean-field ansatz.

Quantum information allows for protocols in the information theoretic setting

protocol by Ambainis achieved a cheating probability of at most 3/4 [Amb01]. On
the other hand, Kitaev showed that no quantum protocol can have cheating
probability less than $1/\sqrt{2}$ [Kit03]. Closing this gap has been one of
the important open questions in quantum cryptography.
  In this paper, we resolve this question by presenting a quantum strong coin
flipping protocol with cheating probability arbitrarily close to $1/\sqrt{2}$.
More precisely, we show how to use any weak coin flipping protocol with
cheating probability $1/2+\epsilon$ in order to achieve a strong coin flipping
protocol with cheating probability $1/\sqrt{2}+O(\epsilon)$. The optimal
quantum strong coin flipping protocol follows from our construction and the

Part I [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 79}, 033836 (2009)]. Here we concentrate on
experimental consequences for cavity QED of two different classes of
representations of harmonic oscillator Lie algebras. The zero-temperature
master equation, derived in Part I for irreducible representations of the
algebra, is reformulated in a reducible representation that models
electromagnetic fields by a gas of harmonic oscillator wave packets. The
representation is known to introduce automatic regularizations that in
irreducible representations would have to be justified by ad hoc arguments.
Predictions based on this representation are characterized in thermodynamic
limit by a single parameter $\varsigma$, responsible for collapses and revivals
of Rabi oscillations in exact vacuum. Collapses and revivals disappear in the
limit $\varsigma\to\infty$. Observation of a finite $\varsigma$ would mean that
cavity quantum fields are described by a non-Wightmanian theory, where vacuum
states are zero-temperature Bose-Einstein condensates of a finite-particle
bosonic oscillator gas and, thus, are non-unique. The data collected in the
experiment of Brune {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf{76}}, 1800 (1996)] are

An intuitive feature for classical models is non-contextuality: the property
that any measurement has a value which is independent of other compatible
measurements being carried out at the same time. However, the results of
Kochen, Specker, and Bell show that non-contextuality is in conflict with
quantum mechanics. The conflict resides in the structure of the theory and is
independent of the properties of special states. It has been debated whether
the Kochen-Specker theorem could be experimentally tested at all. Only
recently, first tests of quantum contextuality have been proposed and
undertaken with photons and neutrons. Yet these tests required the generation
of special quantum states and left various loopholes open. Here, using trapped
ions, we experimentally demonstrate a state-independent conflict with
non-contextuality. The experiment is not subject to the detection loophole and
we show that, despite imperfections and possible measurement disturbances, our
results cannot be explained in non-contextual terms.

external classical electric field. The coupling between the quantum model and
the classical field is taken in the electric dipole approximation. In this
regime, we show the absence of geometric phases in the interacting two-level
model in the presence of any periodic real time-dependent classical electric
field. We obtain a conservative scalar potential in the calculation of Berry's
phases of the instantaneous eigenstates of the model. For complex electric
fields, we recover the existence of geometric phases. In particular, the
geometric phases of the instantaneous eigenstates of the model in the presence
of a positive or of a negative frequency component of the monochromatic
electric field differ by an overall sign. As a check on our results, we map
this interacting two-level model onto a spin-1/2 model under the action of a
classical magnetic field. We confirm that the first one acquires Berry's phase
only in the rotating wave approximation [RWA].

  Quantum State Estimation</title><description>  We undertake a detailed study of the performance of maximum likelihood (ML)
estimators of the density matrix of finite-dimensional quantum systems, in
order to interrogate generic properties of frequentist quantum state
estimation. Existing literature on frequentist quantum estimation has not
rigorously examined the finite sample performance of the estimators and
associated methods of hypothesis testing. While ML is usually preferred on the
basis of its asymptotic properties - it achieves the Cramer-Rao (CR) lower
bound - the finite sample properties are often less than optimal. We compare
the asymptotic and finite-sample properties of the ML estimators and test
statistics for two different choices of measurement bases: the average case
optimal or mutually unbiased bases (MUB) and a representative set of suboptimal
bases, for spin-1/2 and spin-1 systems. We show that, in both cases, the
standard errors of the ML estimators sometimes do not contain the true value of
the parameter, which can render inference based on the asymptotic properties of
the ML unreliable for experimentally realistic sample sizes. The results
indicate that in order to fully exploit the information geometry of quantum
states and achieve smaller reconstruction errors, the use of Bayesian state
reconstruction methods - which, unlike frequentist methods, do not rely on
asymptotic properties - is desirable, since the estimation error is typically
lower due to the incorporation of prior knowledge.

  coherent states</title><description>  We address security of the quantum key distribution scheme based on the noisy
modulation of coherent states and investigate how it is robust against noise in
the modulation regardless of the particular technical implementation. As the
trusted preparation noise is shown to be security breaking even for purely
lossy channels, we reveal the essential difference between two types of trusted
noise, namely sender-side preparation noise and receiver-side detection noise,
the latter being security preserving. We consider the method of sender-side
state purification to compensate the preparation noise and show its
applicability in the realistic conditions of channel loss, untrusted channel
excess noise, and trusted detection noise. We show that purification makes the
scheme robust to the preparation noise (i.e., even the arbitrary noisy coherent
states can in principle be used for the purpose of quantum key distribution).
We also take into account the effect of realistic reconciliation and show that
the purification method is still efficient in this case up to a limited value
of preparation noise.

demonstrated and studied, as an appropriate amplitude modulation to a single
pulse can expand its spectrum and thus increase the utilization efficiency of
the bandwidth of a slow light system. In a single-$\Lambda$ type
electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) system, the slowed AMG pulse
experiences severe distortion, mainly owing to the frequency dependent
transmission of medium. Additionally, due to its spectral distribution, the
frequency dependent dispersion of the medium causes simultaneous slow and fast
light of different spectral components and thus a certain dispersive distortion
of the AMG pulse. Further, a post-processing method is proposed to recover the
slowed (distorted) pulse, which indicates that by introducing a linear optical
system with a desired gain spectrum we can recover the pulse in an
&quot;all-optical&quot; way. Finally, we discuss the limitations during this compensation
procedure in detail. Although it is demonstrated in the cesium vapor using EIT,
this method should be applicable to a wide range of slow light systems.

We prove that these definitions are equivalent to those derived from the

increase under local operations, the irreducible three-party correlation can be
created by local operations from a three-party state with only irreducible
two-party correlations. In other words, even if a three-party state is
initially completely determined by measuring two-party Hermitian operators, the
determination of the state after local operations have to resort to the

the zeros of the combination of the Bessel functions, previously discussed in
the literature, is obtained as a limiting case. As an application we evaluate
the Wightman function for a scalar field with general curvature coupling
parameter in the region between concentric spherical shells on background of
constant negative curvature space. For the Dirichlet boundary conditions the
corresponding mode-sum contains series over the zeros of the combination of the
associated Legendre functions. The application of the summation formula allows
us to present the Wightman function in the form of the sum of two integrals.
The first one corresponds to the Wightman function for the geometry of a single
spherical shell and the second one is induced by the presence of the second
shell. The boundary-induced part in the vacuum expectation value of the field
squared is investigated. For points away from the boundaries the corresponding

convenient categorical formalization of quantum mechanics. The objects
represent physical systems, the morphisms physical operations, whereas the
tensors describe composite systems. Classical data turn out to correspond to
Frobenius algebras with some additional properties. They express the
distinguishing capabilities of classical data: in contrast with quantum data,
classical data can be copied and deleted. The algebraic approach thus shifts
the paradigm of &quot;quantization&quot; of a classical theory to &quot;classicization&quot; of a
quantum theory. Remarkably, the simple SDM framework suffices not only for this
conceptual shift, but even allows us to distinguish the deterministic classical
operations (i.e. functions) from the nondeterministic classical operations
(i.e. relations), and the probabilistic classical operations (stochastic maps).
Moreover, a combination of some basic categorical constructions (due to
Kleisli, resp. Grothendieck) with the categorical presentations of quantum
states, provides a resource sensitive account of various quantum-classical
interactions: of classical control of quantum data, of classical data arising
from quantum measurements, as well as of the classical data processing
in-between controls and measurements. A salient feature here is the graphical
calculus for categorical quantum mechanics, which allows a purely diagrammatic
representation of classical-quantum interaction.

approach for the enhancement of matrix product states, i.e. 1D tensor networks,
where we replace each of the matrices of the original matrix product state with
another 1D tensor network. This procedure yields a 2D tensor network, which
includes -- already for tensor dimension two -- all states that can be prepared
by circuits of polynomially many (possibly non-unitary) two-qubit quantum
operations, as well as states resulting from time evolution with respect to
Hamiltonians with short-ranged interactions. We investigate the possibility to
efficiently extract information from these states, which serves as the basic
step in a variational optimization procedure. To this aim we utilize known
exact and approximate methods for 2D tensor networks and demonstrate some
improvements thereof, which are also applicable e.g. in the context of 2D
projected entangled pair states. We generalize the approach to higher

between two distant parties by wisely exploiting properties of quantum
mechanics. In QKD, experimental measurements on quantum states are transformed
to a secret key and this has to be done in accordance with a security proof.
Unfortunately, many theoretical proofs are not readily implementable in
experiments and do not consider all practical issues. Therefore, in order to
bridge this &quot;practical gap&quot;, we integrate a few existing theoretical results
together with new developments, in effect producing a simple and complete
recipe for classical post-processing that one can follow to derive a secret key
from the measurement outcomes in an actual QKD experiment. This integration is
non-trivial and our consideration is both practical and comprehensive in the
sense that we take into account the finiteness of the key length and consider
the effects on security of several essential primitives (including
authentication, error handling, and privacy amplification). Furthermore, we
quantify the security of the final secret key that is universally composable.
We show that the finite-size effect mainly comes from phase error estimation.
Our result is applicable to the BB84 protocol with a single or entangled photon

periodic driving, the response may exhibit exotic freezing behavior in high
driving frequency ($\omega$) regime. In a periodically driven classical
thermodynamic system, freezing at high $\omega$ occurs when $1/\omega$ is much
smaller than the characteristic relaxation time of the system, and hence the
freezing always increases there as $\omega$ is increased. Here, in the
contrary, we see surprising non-monotonic freezing behavior of the response
with $\omega$, showing curious peak-valley structure. Quite interestingly, the
entire system tends to freeze almost absolutely (the freezing peaks) when
driven with a certain combination of driving parameters values (amplitude and
$\omega$) due to coherent suppression of dynamics of the quantum many-body
modes, which has no classical analog. We demonstrate this new freezing

absorbing boundary conditions are frequently applied. Although this certainly
provides a useful tool in facilitating the description of the system, its
applications to systems consisting of more than one particle is problematic.
This is due to the fact that all information about the system is lost upon
absorption of one particle; a formalism based solely on the Scrh{\&quot;o}dinger
equation is not able to describe the remainder of the system as particles are
lost. Here we demonstrate how the dynamics of a quantum system with a given
number of identical fermions may be described in a manner which allows for
particle loss. A consistent formalism which incorporates the evolution of
sub-systems with a reduced number of particles is constructed through the
Lindblad equation. Specifically, the transition from an $N$-particle system to
an $(N-1)$-particle system due to a complex absorbing potential is achieved by
relating the Lindblad operators to annihilation operators. The method allows
for a straight forward interpretation of how many constituent particles have
left the system after interaction. We illustrate the formalism using
one-dimensional two-particle model problems.

  theory-based analysis of financial crises</title><description>  The last financial and economic crisis demonstrated the dysfunctional
long-term effects of aggressive behaviour in financial markets. Yet,
evolutionary game theory predicts that under the condition of strategic
dependence a certain degree of aggressive behaviour remains within a given
population of agents. However, as the consequences of the financial crisis
exhibit, it would be desirable to change the 'rules of the game' in a way that
prevents the occurrence of any aggressive behaviour and thereby also the danger
of market crashes. The paper picks up this aspect. Through the extension of the
in literature well-known Hawk-Dove game by a quantum approach, we can show that
dependent on entanglement, also evolutionary stable strategies can emerge,
which are not predicted by classical evolutionary game theory and where the
total economic population uses a non aggressive quantum strategy.

formulate a model of computation based on the composition of sparse unitaries

operations and classical communications(LOCCs). We demonstrate our idea by
considering the tripartite case, i.e. the purification of tripartite
entanglement. We express the general tripartite entangled states in a special
representation of total spin operators $J_{123}^{2}$ and $% J_{12}^{2}$ of
tripartite system with eigenvalues 15/4 and 2 respectively. This basis is a
\textit{genuine basis} because it consists of of all the genuine entangled
states of tripartite system. Our protocol is a recurrence one, and only two
copies of the initial mixed tripartite entangled states are needed in each
round. It is shown that if the initial fidelity is larger than a threshold 0.4,
the purification process will succeed.The yield of the current protocol is
higher than the previous multipartite entanglement purification protocols. As a
by-product, we can get a bipartite pure Bell state when the purification
protocol fails for W state. Our protocol also shows that there may be some
special kind of tripartite entanglement which belongs to neither W-type
entanglement nor GHZ-type entanglement.

electrons coupled through the Coulomb interaction, and the building block of
the computing architecture is composed by three adjacent qubit systems in a

central qubit exhibiting a third accessible state of electronic energy far away

and acts as a barrier mechanism for the direct control of qubit entanglement.
Initial estimations of the spontaneous emission decay rates associated to the

which suggest a not so strong coupling to the environment. Our results offer an
all-optical, scalable, proposal for global quantum computing based on

these system can deliver picosecond single-photon pulses at their zero-phonon

functions, such that a state describing n particles depends on n spacetime
positions. Since a general state is a superposition of states with different
numbers of particles, the wave function lives in the configuration space
identified with a product of an infinite number of 4-dimensional Minkowski
spacetimes. The squared absolute value of the wave function is interpreted as
the probability density in the configuration space, from which the standard
probabilistic predictions of QFT can be recovered. Such a formulation and
probabilistic interpretation of QFT allows to interpret the wave function as a
pilot wave that describes deterministic particle trajectories, which
automatically includes a deterministic and continuous description of particle
creation and destruction. In particular, when the conditional wave function
associated with a quantum measurement ceases to depend on one of the spacetime
coordinates, then the 4-velocity of the corresponding particle vanishes,
describing a trajectory that stops at a particular point in spacetime. In a
more general situation a dependence on this spacetime coordinate is negligibly
small but not strictly zero, in which case the trajectory does not stop but the
measuring apparatus still behaves as if this particle has been destroyed.

correction will be necessary to build reliable quantum computers. The theory of
quantum error-correcting codes has some close ties to and some striking
differences from the theory of classical error-correcting codes. Many quantum
codes can be described in terms of the stabilizer of the codewords. The
stabilizer is a finite Abelian group, and allows a straightforward
characterization of the error-correcting properties of the code. The stabilizer
formalism for quantum codes also illustrates the relationships to classical
coding theory, particularly classical codes over GF(4), the finite field with
four elements. To build a quantum computer which behaves correctly in the
presence of errors, we also need a theory of fault-tolerant quantum
computation, instructing us how to perform quantum gates on qubits which are
encoded in a quantum error-correcting code. The threshold theorem states that
it is possible to create a quantum computer to perform an arbitrary quantum
computation provided the error rate per physical gate or time step is below
some constant threshold value.

information of its initial state to the coupled system. This dynamic process
can be referred to as a quantum thermalization in the sense that the coupled
system can reach a stable thermal equilibrium with a temperature equal to that

in which a series of initially prepared two-level atoms randomly pass through
an electromagnetic cavity. It is found that, when the randomly injected atoms
are initially prepared in a thermal equilibrium state with a given temperature,
the cavity field will reach a thermal equilibrium state with the same
temperature as that of the injected atoms. As in two limit cases, the cavity
field can be cooled and &quot;coherently heated&quot; as a maser process, respectively,
when the injected atoms are initially prepared in ground and excited states.
Especially, when the atoms in equilibrium are driven to possess some coherence,
the cavity field may reach a higher temperature in comparison with the injected
atoms. We also point out a possible experimental test for our theoretical

distinguish between strongly and weakly non-Humean, non-supervenient relations.
It is demonstrated that in either case the relations of quantum entanglement

supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of Humean qualities, weakening,
thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It is examined, in this respect,

smaller than the parametric coupling rate. In the case for cavity-assisted
optomechanical systems, e.g. the one proposed by Thompson et al., zero-point
motion of the mechanical oscillator needs to be comparable to linear dynamical
range of the optical system which is characterized by the optical wavelength

classical search algorithm. It is known that quantum correlations such as
entanglement are necessary for the power of quantum computation. But
entanglement is not the only kind of quantum correlations. Other quantum
correlations such as quantum discord are also useful to capture some aspects of
the nonclassical correlation. We investigate several kinds of correlations
including both quantum and classical in the whole process of Grover search
algorithm. These correlations are the concurrence, entanglement of formation,
quantum discord, classical correlation and mutual information. The behaviors of
quantum discord, classical correlation and mutual information are almost the
same while the concurrence is different. When the search is over, all kinds of
correlations are zero, we argue that this is necessary for the final step in
the search.

  is nearly tight for every boolean function</title><description>  The general adversary bound is a semi-definite program (SDP) that
lower-bounds the quantum query complexity of a function. We turn this lower
bound into an upper bound, by giving a quantum walk algorithm based on the dual
SDP that has query complexity at most the general adversary bound, up to a
logarithmic factor.
  In more detail, the proof has two steps, each based on &quot;span programs,&quot; a
certain linear-algebraic model of computation. First, we give an SDP that
outputs for any boolean function a span program computing it that has optimal
&quot;witness size.&quot; The optimal witness size is shown to coincide with the general
adversary lower bound. Second, we give a quantum algorithm for evaluating span
programs with only a logarithmic query overhead on the witness size.
  The first result is motivated by a quantum algorithm for evaluating composed
span programs. The algorithm is known to be optimal for evaluating a large
class of formulas. The allowed gates include all constant-size functions for
which there is an optimal span program. So far, good span programs have been
found in an ad hoc manner, and the SDP automates this procedure. Surprisingly,
the SDP's value equals the general adversary bound. A corollary is an optimal
quantum algorithm for evaluating &quot;balanced&quot; formulas over any finite boolean
gate set. The second result extends span programs' applicability beyond the
formula evaluation problem.
  A strong universality result for span programs follows. A good quantum query
algorithm for a problem implies a good span program, and vice versa. Although
nearly tight, this equivalence is nontrivial. Span programs are a promising
model for developing more quantum algorithms.

  Noisy Channels</title><description>  We have tried to interpret the physical role of the three-tangle and
$\pi$-tangle in the real physical information process. For the model
calculation we adopt the three-party teleportation scheme through the various
noisy channels. The three parties consist of sender, accomplice and receiver.
It is shown that the $\pi$-tangles for the X- and Z-noisy channels vanish at
$\kappa t \to \infty$ limit, where $\kappa t$ is a parameter introduced in the
master equation of Lindblad form. In this limit the receiver's maximum fidelity
reduces to the classical limit 2/3. However, this nice feature is not
maintained at the Y- and isotropy-noise channels. For Y-noise channel the
$\pi$-tangle vanishes at $0.61 \leq \kappa t$. At $\kappa t = 0.61$ the
receiver's maximum fidelity becomes 0.57, which is much less than the classical
limit. Similar phenomenon occurs at the isotropic noise channel. We also
computed the three-tangles analytically for the X- and Z-noise channels. The
remarkable fact is that the three-tangle for Z-noise channel is exactly same
with the corresponding $\pi$-tangle. In the X-noise channel the three-tangle
vanishes at $0.10 \leq \kappa t$. At $\kappa t = 0.10$ the receiver's fidelity
can be reduced to the classical limit provided that the accomplice performs the
measurement appropriately. However, the receiver's maximum fidelity becomes
8/9, which is much larger than the classical limit. Since the Y- and
isotropy-noise channels are rank-8 mixed states, their three-tangles are not
computed explicitly. Instead, we have derived their upper bounds with use of
the analytical three-tangles for other noisy channels. Our analysis strongly
suggests that we need different three-party entanglement measure whose value is
between three-tangle and $\pi$-tangle.

states which can serve as &quot;flying spin qubits&quot; when the domain walls are moved.
We show theoretically that, when two of these rings are coupled, the movement
of the domain walls leads to modulation of the effective exchange interaction

give rise to ferromagnetic effective exchange. We describe how these spin rings

to design a control to drive the state from the identity to any element of the
group. The first method, under appropriate assumptions, achieves exact control
to the target but requires estimation of the `size' of a neighborhood of the
identity in G. The second method, does not involve any mathematical difficulty,
and obtains control to a desired target with arbitrary accuracy. A third method
is then given combining the main ideas of the previous methods. This is also
very simple in its formulation and turns out to be generically more efficient
as illustrated by one of the examples we consider.
  The methods described in the paper provide arbitrary constructive control for

closed multilevel quantum systems and lossless electrical networks. In

of the nuclear deformed mean-field plus pairing interaction model is proposed
via a simple Bethe ansatz in each step from which the eigenvalues and
corresponding eigenstates can be obtained progressively. This new approach
draws upon an observation that the original one- plus two-body problem in a
$k$-particle Hilbert subspace can be mapped unto a one-body grand hard-core
boson picture that can be solved step by step with a simple Bethe ansatz known
from earlier work. Based on this new procedure, it is further shown that the

in which only the lowest energy eigenstate of the standard pure pairing
interaction part is taken into consideration. Our analysis show that the

independent of $\zeta_0$ the dynamics follows a similar pattern. For small
$\zeta_0$ all of our curves collapses to essentially a single curve when scaled
by the maximum value of the quantum-classical difference. In both limits of
large and small $\zeta_0$ we see a saturation effect in the size of the
quantum-classical difference; that is, the instantaneous difference between
quantum and classical evolutions cannot be either too small or too large.

research field of cold and ultracold molecules. It serves as an introduction to
the Special Issue of the New Journal of Physics on Cold and Ultracold Molecules
and describes new prospects for fundamental research and technological
development. Cold and ultracold molecules may revolutionize physical chemistry
and few body physics, provide techniques for probing new states of quantum
matter, allow for precision measurements of both fundamental and applied
interest, and enable quantum simulations of condensed-matter phenomena.
Ultracold molecules offer promising applications such as new platforms for
quantum computing, precise control of molecular dynamics, nanolithography, and
Bose-enhanced chemistry. The discussion is based on recent experimental and
theoretical work and concludes with a summary of anticipated future directions
and open questions in this rapidly expanding research field.

  models: application to the study of correlation functions in nonequilibrium
  1D Bose gas</title><description>  In this paper we study nonequilibrium dynamics of one dimensional Bose gas
from the general perspective of dynamics of integrable systems. After outlining
and critically reviewing methods based on inverse scattering transform,
intertwining operators, q-deformed objects, and extended dynamical conformal
symmetry, we focus on the form-factor based approach. Motivated by possible
applications in nonlinear quantum optics and experiments with ultracold atoms,
we concentrate on the regime of strong repulsive interactions. We consider
dynamical evolution starting from two initial states: a condensate of particles
in a state with zero momentum and a condensate of particles in a gaussian
wavepacket in real space. Combining the form-factor approach with the method of
intertwining operator we develop a numerical procedure which allows explicit
summation over intermediate states and analysis of the time evolution of
non-local density-density correlation functions. In both cases we observe a
tendency toward formation of crystal-like correlations at intermediate time
scales.

quantum field correlations, such as the appearance of entanglement, and of
causal effects. We consider the detection in the case of a simple QFT model
with a suitable interaction to exact treatment, consisting of a quantum scalar
field coupled linearly to a classical scalar source. We then evaluate the
response function to the field quanta of two-level point-like quantum model
detectors, and analyze the effects of the approximation adopted in standard
detection theory. We show that the use of the RWA, that characterizes the
Glauber detection model, leads in the detector response to non-local terms
corresponding to an instantaneously spreading of source effects over the whole
space. Other detector models, obtained with non-standard or the no-application
of RWA, give instead local responses to field quanta, apart from source
independent vacuum contribution linked to preexisting correlations of
zero-point field.

  the semiclassical propagator</title><description>  Quantized systems whose underlying classical dynamics possess an elaborate
mixture of regular and chaotic motion can exhibit rather subtle long-time
quantum transport phenomena. In a short wavelength regime where semiclassical
theories are most relevant, such transport phenomena, being quintessentially
interference based, are difficult to understand with the system's specific
long-time classical dynamics. Fortunately, semiclassical methods applied to
wave packet propagation can provide a natural approach to understanding the
connections, even though they are known to break down progressively as time
increases. This is due to the fact that some long-time transport properties can
be deduced from intermediate-time behavior. Thus, these methods need only
retain validity and be carried out on much shorter time scales than the
transport phenomena themselves in order to be valuable. The initial value
representation of the semiclassical propagator of Herman and Kluk [M. F. Herman
and E. Kluk, Chem. Phys. 91, 27 (1984)] is heavily used in a number of
molecular and atomic physics contexts, and is of interest here. It is known to
be increasingly challenging to implement as the underlying classical chaos
strengthens, and we ask whether it is possible to implement it well enough to
extract the kind of intermediate time information that reflects wave packet
localization at long times. Using a system of two coupled quartic oscillators,
we focus on the localizing effects of transport barriers formed by stable and
unstable manifolds in the chaotic sea and show that these effects can be
captured with the Herman-Kluk propagator.

retardation ER). Quantum mechanics allows one to calculate the evolution of
both systems separately and to compare them thus verifying ER. It is shown here
that ER is not valid for a simple system: the spreading packet of the free
spinless particle. Earlier it was shown that ER does not hold for some other
systems. So one may state that ER is not a universal kinematic law in quantum

Surprisingly, even moderately squeezed states may exhibit perfect quantumness

  mixtures</title><description>  We study improper mixtures from a quantum logical and geometrical point of
view. Taking into account the fact that improper mixtures do not admit an
ignorance interpretation and must be considered as states in their own right,
we do not follow the standard approach which considers improper mixtures as
measures over the algebra of projections. Instead of it, we use the convex set
of states in order to construct a new lattice whose atoms are all physical
states: pure states and improper mixtures. This is done in order to overcome
one of the problems which appear in the standard quantum logical formalism,
namely, that for a subsystem of a larger system in an entangled state, the
conjunction of all actual properties of the subsystem does not yield its actual
state. In fact, its state is an improper mixture and cannot be represented in
the von Neumann lattice as a minimal property which determines all other
properties as is the case for pure states or classical systems. The new lattice
also contains all propositions of the von Neumann lattice. We argue that this
extension expresses in an algebraic form the fact that -alike the classical
case- quantum interactions produce non trivial correlations between the
systems. Finally, we study the maps which can be defined between the extended
lattice of a compound system and the lattices of its subsystems.

bath at an arbitrary temperature. We find an exact closed expression for the
oscillator density operator. This state is non-canonical but can be shown to be
equivalent to that of an uncoupled linear oscillator at an effective
temperature T_{eff} with an effective mass and an effective spring constant. We
derive an effective Clausius inequality delta Q_{eff} =&lt; T_{eff} dS, where
delta Q_{eff} is the heat exchanged between the effective (weakly coupled)
oscillator and the bath, and S represents a thermal entropy of the effective
oscillator, being identical to the von-Neumann entropy of the coupled
oscillator. Using this inequality (for a cyclic process in terms of a variation
of the coupling strength) we confirm the validity of the second law. For a
fixed coupling strength this inequality can also be tested for a process in
terms of a variation of either the oscillator mass or its spring constant. Then
it is never violated. The properly defined Clausius inequality is thus more
robust than assumed previously.

that any quantum state can be generated from a given resource by means of
single-qubit (local) operations assisted by classical communication. More
precisely, we consider the approximate and stochastic generation of states,
resulting e.g. from a restriction to finite measurement settings or from
possible imperfections in the resources or local operations. We show that
entanglement-based criteria for universality obtained for the exact,
deterministic case can be lifted to the much more general approximate,
stochastic case, moving from the idealized situation considered in previous
works, to the practically relevant context of non-perfect state preparation. We
find that any entanglement measure fulfilling some basic requirements needs to
reach its maximum value on some element of an approximate, stochastic universal
family of resource states, as the resource size grows. This allows us to rule
out various families of states as being approximate, stochastic universal. We
provide examples of resources that are efficient approximate universal, but not
exact deterministic universal. We also study the robustness of universal
resources for measurement-based quantum computation under realistic assumptions
about the (imperfect) generation and manipulation of entangled states, giving
an explicit expression for the impact that errors made in the preparation of
the resource have on the possibility to use it for universal approximate and
stochastic state preparation. Finally, we discuss the relation between our
entanglement-based criteria and recent results regarding the uselessness of
states with a high degree of geometric entanglement as universal resources.

separated by a vacuum gap turns out to be compact and effective. A central
ingredient of this method is the effect of interacting fluctuating dipole
moments of the polarizable particles. At arbitrary temperature the path
integral formulation of quantized particles, developed by H{\o}ye-Stell and
others, is needed. At high temperature - the limit considered in the present
paper - the classical theory is however sufficient. Our present theory is
related to an idea put forward earlier by Jancovici and {\v{S}}amaj (2004),
namely to evaluate the Casimir force between parallel plates invoking an
electronic plasma model and the Debye-H\&quot;uckel theory for electrolytes. Their
result was recently recovered by H{\o}ye (2008), using a related statistical
mechanical method. In the present paper we generalize this by including a
constant permittivity in the description. The present paper generalizes our
earlier theory for parallel plates (1998), as well as for spherical dielectrics
(2001). We also consider the Casimir force between a polarizable particle and a
conductor with a small density of charges, finding agreement with the result
recently derived by Pitaevskii (2008).

the joint amplitude both in the spectral and temporal domains, as well as for
the chronocyclic Wigner function of heralded single photons, which fully

through a dispersive medium, entanglement can &quot;migrate&quot; between the modulus and

2, but when used together with a second channel with zero private capacity the
joint capacity jumps to (1/2)log d. In contrast to earlier work which found
nonadditivity vanishing as a fraction of input size or conditional on unproven

degrees of freedom allows quantum-limited position measurements and gives rise
to dynamical backaction enabling amplification and cooling of mechanical
motion. Here we demonstrate purely dispersive coupling of high Q nanomechanical
oscillators to an ultra-high finesse optical microresonator via its evanescent
field, extending cavity optomechanics to nanomechanical oscillators. Dynamical
backaction mediated by the optical dipole force is observed, leading to
laser-like coherent nanomechanical oscillations solely due to radiation
pressure. Moreover, sub-fm/Hz^(1/2) displacement sensitivity is achieved, with
a measurement imprecision equal to the standard quantum limit (SQL), which
coincides with the nanomechanical oscillator's zero-point fluctuations. The
achievement of an imprecision at the SQL and radiation-pressure dynamical
backaction for nanomechanical oscillators may have implications not only for
detecting quantum phenomena in mechanical systems, but also for a variety of
other precision experiments. Owing to the flexibility of the near-field
coupling approach, it can be readily extended to a diverse set of
nanomechanical oscillators and particularly provides a route to experiments
where radiation pressure quantum backaction dominates at room temperature,
enabling ponderomotive squeezing or QND measurements.

constitutes a quantum measurement with a controllable form of the measurement
back-action. Time-resolved counting of scattered photons alters the state of
the atoms without particle loss implementing a quantum nondemolition (QND)
measurement. The conditional dynamics is given by the interplay between
photodetection events (quantum jumps) and no-count processes. The class of
emerging atomic many-body states can be chosen via the optical geometry and
light frequencies. Light detection along the angle of a diffraction maximum
(Bragg angle) creates an atom-number squeezed state, while light detection at
diffraction minima leads to the macroscopic superposition states (Schroedinger
cat states) of different atom numbers in the cavity mode. A measurement of the
cavity transmission intensity can lead to atom-number squeezed or macroscopic
superposition states depending on its outcome. We analyze the robustness of the
superposition with respect to missed counts and find that a transmission
measurement yields more robust and controllable superposition states than the
ones obtained by scattering at a diffraction minimum.

wish to generate a random bit in order to choose between two alternatives. This
task is impossible to realize when it relies solely on the asynchronous
exchange of classical bits: one dishonest player has complete control over the
final outcome. It is only when coin flipping is supplemented with quantum
communication that this problem can be alleviated, although partial bias
remains. Unfortunately, practical systems are subject to loss of quantum data,
which restores complete or nearly complete bias in previous protocols. We
report herein on the first implementation of a quantum coin-flipping protocol
that is impervious to loss. Moreover, in the presence of unavoidable
experimental noise, we propose to use this protocol sequentially to implement
many coin flips, which guarantees that a cheater unwillingly reveals
asymptotically, through an increased error rate, how many outcomes have been
fixed. Hence, we demonstrate for the first time the possibility of flipping
coins in a realistic setting. Flipping quantum coins thereby joins quantum key
distribution as one of the few currently practical applications of quantum
communication. We anticipate our findings to be useful for various
cryptographic protocols and other applications, such as an online casino, in
which a possibly unlimited number of coin flips has to be performed and where
each player is free to decide at any time whether to continue playing or not.

players, who in principle do not trust each other, wish to establish a common
random bit. If we limit ourselves to classical communication, this task
requires either assumptions on the computational power of the players or it
requires them to send messages to each other with sufficient simultaneity to
force their complete independence. Without such assumptions, all classical
protocols are so that one dishonest player has complete control over the
outcome. If we use quantum communication, on the other hand, protocols have
been introduced that limit the maximal bias that dishonest players can produce.
However, those protocols would be very difficult to implement in practice
because they are susceptible to realistic losses on the quantum channel between
the players or in their quantum memory and measurement apparatus. In this
paper, we introduce a novel quantum protocol and we prove that it is completely
impervious to loss. The protocol is fair in the sense that either player has
the same probability of success in cheating attempts at biasing the outcome of
the coin flip. We also give explicit and optimal cheating strategies for both
players.

evaluation. This is the typical problem addressed by the quantum algorithms. In
former theoretical work, we showed that a quantum algorithm requires the number
of function evaluations of a classical algorithm that knows in advance 50% of
the information that specifies the solution of the problem. Here we check that
this 50% rule holds for the main quantum algorithms. In the structured
problems, a classical algorithm with the advanced information, to identify the
missing information should perform one function evaluation. The speed up is
exponential since a classical algorithm without advanced information should
perform an exponential number of function evaluations. In unstructured database
search, a classical algorithm that knows in advance 50% of the n bits of the
database location, to identify the n/2 missing bits should perform Order(2
power n/2) function evaluations. The speed up is quadratic since a classical
algorithm without advanced information should perform Order(2 power n) function
evaluations. The 50% rule identifies the problems solvable with a quantum sped
up in an entirely classical way, in fact by comparing two classical algorithms,
with and without the advanced information.

still of great interest today. He found that three particles subjected to a
resonant pairwise interaction can join into an infinite number of loosely bound
states even though each particle pair cannot bind. Interestingly, the
properties of these aggregates, such as the peculiar geometric scaling of their
energy spectrum, are universal, i.e. independent of the microscopic details of
their components. Despite an extensive search in many different physical
systems, including atoms, molecules and nuclei, the characteristic spectrum of
Efimov trimer states still eludes observation. Here we report on the discovery
of two bound trimer states of potassium atoms very close to the Efimov
scenario, which we reveal by studying three-particle collisions in an ultracold
gas. Our observation provides the first evidence of an Efimov spectrum and
allows a direct test of its scaling behaviour, shedding new light onto the
physics of few-body systems.

contribution to the entanglement entropy S = - tr rho_A log rho_A scales as the
area of the boundary of subsystem A. The coefficient of this &quot;area law&quot; is
non-universal. However, in the neighbourhood of a quantum critical point S is
believed to possess subleading universal corrections. In the present work, we
study the entanglement entropy in the quantum O(N) model in 1 &lt; d &lt; 3. We use
an expansion in epsilon = 3-d to evaluate i) the universal geometric correction
to S for an infinite cylinder divided along a circular boundary; ii) the
universal correction to S due to a finite correlation length. Both corrections
are different at the Wilson-Fisher and Gaussian fixed points, and the epsilon
-&gt; 0 limit of the Wilson-Fisher fixed point is distinct from the Gaussian fixed
point. In addition, we compute the correlation length correction to the Renyi
entropy S_n = (log tr rho^n_A)/(1-n) in epsilon and large-N expansions. For N

color code is studied. The topological entropy is used to measure the behavior
of the topological order. Topological order in color code arises from the
colored string-net structures. By imposing the hard constrained limit the exact
solution of the entanglement entropy becomes possible. For finite size systems,
by raising the temperature, one type of string-net structure is thermalized and
the associative topological entropy vanishes. In the thermodynamic limit the
underlying topological order is fragile even at very low temperatures. Taking
first the thermodynamic limit and then the zero-temperature limit and vice
versa does not commute, and their difference is related only to the topology of
regions. The contribution of the colors and symmetry of the model in the
topological entropy is also discussed. It is shown how the gauge symmetry of
the color code underlies the topological entropy.

local-realistic framework that provides exact, deterministic, and local
underpinning of at least the Bell, GHZ-3, GHZ-4, and Hardy states. The
correlations exhibited by these states are shown to be exactly the classical
correlations among the points of a 3 or 7-sphere, both of which are closed

alleged non-localities of these states are thus shown to result from
misidentified topologies of the EPR elements of reality. When topologies are

the conditions under which probabilities may be assigned to sets of quantum
histories. A variety of conditions have been proposed, but the most important
one is decoherence, which means that the interference between every pair of
histories in the set is zero. Weaker conditions have been considered, such as
consistency, or linear positivity, but these are ruled out by the requirement
of consistent composition of subsystems, proposed by Diosi. Here we propose a
new condition which we call partial decoherence, and is the requirement that
every history has zero interference with its negation. This is weaker than
decoherence and stronger than linear positivity (but its relation to
consistency is less simply defined -- it is neither stronger nor weaker). Most
importantly, it satisfies the Diosi condition. A strengthened Diosi condition
is proposed, which partial decoherence narrowly fails, due to an unusual
property of inhomogeneous histories. In an appendix an example is given of a
set of histories which are consistent but not decoherent.

the inner electron wave function. As a result, it dramatically increases its
probability to be ionized. A simple model is analyzed demonstrating that the
decay probability, compared to the case of a local (Hartree) atomic potential,
increases by many orders of magnitude. As a result of such increase, the ratio
of inner to outer electrons ionization probability became not too small. It is
essential that the effect of exchange upon probability of inner electron
ionization by strong electric field is proportional to the square of the number

The relation between the quantum state description and the classical state
description is elucidated. The difference of those sets of tomograms is
described by inequalities equivalent to a complete set of uncertainty relations
for the quantum domain and to nonnegativity of probability density on phase
space in the classical domain. Intersection of such sets is studied. The
mathematical mechanism which allows to construct different kinds of tomographic
probabilities like symplectic tomograms, spin tomograms, photon number
tomograms, etc., is clarified and a connection with abstract Hilbert space
properties is established. Superposition rule and uncertainty relations in
terms of probabilities as well as quantum basic equation like quantum evolution

experimentally uncertainty relations is suggested using optical tomograms.
Entanglement phenomena and the connection with semigroups acting on simplexes

approximation, i.e., in terms of the discrete nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger equation.
If the static field is varied the system shows a plethora of dynamical
phenomena. In the strong field limit we demonstrate the existence of (almost)
non-spreading states which remain localized on the lattice region populated
initially and show coherent Bloch oscillations with fractional revivals in the
momentum space (so called quantum carpets). With decreasing field, the dynamics
becomes irregular, however, still confined in configuration space. For even
weaker fields we find sub-diffusive dynamics with a wave-packet width spreading
as $t^{1/4}$.

problem by considering every term in the quantum superposition as actual. A
seemingly opposed solution is proposed by modal interpretations (MI) which
state that quantum mechanics does not provide an account of what `actually is
the case', but rather deals with what `might be the case', i.e. with
possibilities. In this paper we provide an algebraic framework which allows us
to analyze in depth the modal aspects of MWI. Within our general formal scheme
we also provide a formal comparison between MWI and MI, in particular, we
provide a formal understanding of why --even though both interpretations share
the same formal structure-- MI fall pray of Kochen-Specker (KS) type
contradictions while MWI escape them.

  computer</title><description>  The susceptibility of the transformed information to the filed and system
parameters is investigated for the Kane solid state computer. It has been
shown, that the field polarization and the initial state of the system play the
central roles on the abrupt and gradual quench of the purity and the fidelity.
If the field and the initial state are in different polarizations, then the
purity and the fidelity decrease abruptly, while for the common polarization
the decay is gradual and smooth. For some class of initial states one can send
the information without any loss. Therefore, by controlling on the devices one
can increase the time of safe communication, reduce the amount of exchange
information between the state and its environment and minimize the purity
decrease rate.

quantifying frequency correlations. Strategies to generate spectrally
uncorrelated photons, necessary in multiphoton interference experiments, are
analyzed with respect to trade-offs between parameters of the source.

atomic internal and motional states, realizing a trapped-atom interferometer

non-equilibrium and $asymmetry$ to a magnetic dipole, undergoing infinitesimal
spin-alignment changes. Periodic perturbation of this background by local
H-fields of template-partners can lead to periodic high and low-template
affinity states, due to the dipole's magnetic degree of freedom. An
accompanying magnetocaloric effect allows interchange between system-entropy

independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) states. Unfortunately, these
theorems only hold in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and their direct

we address this problem by considering invariance under orthogonal

leads to a new type of quantum de Finetti's theorem that is particularly
relevant to continuous-variable systems. Specifically, an n-mode bosonic state
that is invariant with respect to this continuous symmetry in phase space is
proven to converge towards a probabilistic mixture of i.i.d. Gaussian states
(actually, n identical thermal states).

both in physical science and today's philosophy of nature are evaluated. To
this end, Lewis' thesis of Humean supervenience is presented as an important
case study of an atomistic doctrine in philosophical thought. According to the
thesis of Humean supervenience, the world is fragmented into local matters of
particular fact and everything else supervenes upon them in conjunction with
the spatiotemporal relations among them. It is explicitly shown that Lewis'
ontological doctrine of Humean supervenience incorporates at its foundation the
so-called separability principle of classical physics. In view of the
systematic violation of the latter within quantum mechanics, it is argued that
contemporary physical science posits non-supervenient relations over and above
the spatiotemporal ones. It is demonstrated that the relation of quantum
entanglement constitutes the prototypical example of a holistic, irreducible
physical relation that does not supervene upon a spatiotemporal arrangement of
Humean qualities, undermining, thereby, the thesis of Humean supervenience. It
is concluded, in this respect, that the assumption of ontological reductionism,
as expressed in Lewis' Humean doctrine, cannot be regarded as a reliable code
of the nature of the physical world and its contents. It is proposed instead
that - due to the undeniable existence of generic non-supervenient relations -
a metaphysic of relations of a moderate kind ought to be acknowledged as an
indispensable part of our understanding of the natural world at a fundamental

  Systems Using Weighted Graph and Bloch Representation of States</title><description>  This thesis is an attempt to enhance understanding of the following questions
A- Given a multipartite quantum state (possibly mixed), how to find out whether
it is entangled or separable? (Detection of entanglement.) B- Given an
entangled state, how to decide how much entangled it is? (Measure of
entanglement.), in the context of multipartite quantum states.
  We have explored two approaches. In the first approach, we assign a weighted
graph with multipartite quantum state and address the question of separability
in terms of these graphs and various operations involving them. In the second
approach we use the so called Bloch representation of multipartite quantum
states to establish new criteria for detection of multipartite entangled
states. We further give a new measure for entanglement in $N$-qubit entangled
pure state and formally extend it to cover $N$-qubit mixed states.

philosophical point of view. It is justified the opinion that the philosophical
attitude the Copenhagen interpretation is based on is in principle inevitable
for a real comprehension of quantum theory. This attitude is mainly related to
epistemological arguments. However, the measurement problem often seems not to
be treated clearly enough within the interpretation. By referring to the
property of the necessity to use macroscopic measurement instruments obeying
classical concepts it is made the attempt to solve the measurement problem.
According to this consideration the indeterministic character of quantum theory
seems to have its origin in a lack of knowledge and thus it appears in a
similar but more principle way than in statistical mechanics. It is emphasized
the ontological character of the uncertainty relation and the related non
locality of quantum theory suggesting that the existence of a position space is
not as fundamental as the assumptions of general quantum theory.

  generalized Peres-Horodecki conditions</title><description>  The probability that a generic real, complex or quaternionic two-qubit state
is separable can be considered to be the sum of three contributions. One is
from those states that are absolutely separable, that is those (which can not
be entangled by unitary transformations) for which the maximal concurrence over
spectral orbits (C_{max}) is zero. The other two contributions are from the
states for which C_{max} in [0,1/2], and for which C_{max} in [1/2,1]. We have
previously (arXiv:0805.0267) found exact formulas for the absolutely separable
contributions in terms of the Hilbert-Schmidt metric over the quantum states,
and here advance hypotheses as to the exact contributions for C_{max} in
[1/2,1]. A crucial element in understanding the other two contributions is the
nature of the ratio (R) of the C_{max}-parameterized separability function for
the complex states to the square of the comparable function for the real
states--both such functions having clearly displayed jump discontinuities at
C_{max}=1/2. For C_{max} in [0,1/2], R appears to be of the form 1+ k C_{max},
except near C_{max}=1/2, while for C_{max} in [1/2,1], it seems to be a
constant (thus according to the Dyson-index pattern of random matrix theory).
Related phenomena also occur for the minimally-degenerate two-qubit states and
the qubit-qutrit states. Our results have immediate application to the
computation of separability probabilities in terms of other metrics, such as
the Bures (minimal monotone) metric. The paper begins with continuous
embeddings of the separability probability question in terms of four metrics of

well known that if each member in a linear chain of coupled harmonic
oscillators is prepared in a ``classical state'', such as a pure coherent state
or a mixed thermal state, no entanglement is created in the rotating wave
approximation. On the other hand, if one of the oscillators is prepared in a
nonclassical state (pure squeezed state, for instance), entanglement may be
created between members of the chain. In the setup considered here, we found
that a great family of nonclassical (squeezed) states can localize entanglement
in such a way that distant oscillators never become entangled. We present a
detailed study of this particular localization phenomenon. Our results may find
application in future solid state implementations of quantum computers, and we
suggest an electromechanical system consisting of an array of coupled

excellent axial resolution can be obtained in a photon-counting coherence
domain imaging (CDI) system that uses light generated via spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a chirped periodically poled
stoichiometric lithium tantalate (chirped-PPSLT) structure, in conjunction with
a niobium nitride superconducting single-photon detector (SSPD). The bandwidth
of the light generated via SPDC, as well as the bandwidth over which the SSPD
is sensitive, can extend over a wavelength region that stretches from 700 to
1500 nm. This ultra-broad wavelength band offers a near-ideal combination of
deep penetration and ultra-high axial resolution for the imaging of biological

1064 nm, via the use of chirped-PPSLT structures, had not been previously
achieved. To demonstrate the usefulness of this technique, we have constructed

Lagrangian approach we obtain a transformation that makes the extended PU
oscillator, with unequal frequencies, to be equivalent to two standard second
order oscillators which have the original number of degrees of freedom. Such
extension is provided by adding a total time derivative to the PU Lagrangian
together with a complexification of the original variables further subjected to
reality conditions in order to maintain the required number of degrees of

Remarkably, at the quantum level the negative norm states are eliminated, as
well as the problems of unbounded below energy and non-unitary time evolution.
We illustrate the idea of our approach by eliminating the negative norm states
in a complex oscillator. Next, we extend the procedure to the Pais-Uhlenbeck
oscillator. The corresponding quantum propagators are calculated using
Schwinger's quantum action principle. We also discuss the equal frequency case

  evolution, probability, and scientific confirmation</title><description>  There is a compelling intellectual case for exploring whether purely unitary
quantum theory defines a sensible and scientifically adequate theory, as
Everett originally proposed. Many different and incompatible attempts to define
a coherent Everettian quantum theory have been made over the past fifty years.
However, no known version of the theory (unadorned by extra ad hoc postulates)
can account for the appearance of probabilities and explain why the theory it
was meant to replace, Copenhagen quantum theory, appears to be confirmed, or
more generally why our evolutionary history appears to be Born-rule typical.
This article reviews some ingenious and interesting recent attempts in this
direction by Wallace, Greaves, Myrvold and others, and explains why they don't
work. An account of one-world randomness, which appears scientifically
satisfactory, and has no many-worlds analogue, is proposed. A fundamental
obstacle to confirming many-worlds theories is illustrated by considering some
toy many-worlds models. These models show that branch weights can exist without
having any role in either rational decision-making or theory confirmation, and
also that the latter two roles are logically separate. Wallace's proposed
decision theoretic axioms for rational agents in a multiverse and claimed
derivation of the Born rule are examined. It is argued that Wallace's strategy
of axiomatizing a mathematically precise decision theory within a fuzzy
Everettian quasiclassical ontology is incoherent. Moreover, Wallace's axioms
are not constitutive of rationality either in Everettian quantum theory or in
theories in which branchings and branch weights are precisely defined. In both
cases, there exist coherent rational strategies that violate some of the
axioms.

certain Lifshitz-like fixed points with anisotropic scale invariance. They are
expected to describe a class of D3-D7 systems and their finite temperature
generalizations are straightforward. We show that there exist solutions that
interpolate between these anisotropic solutions in the IR and the standard AdS5
solutions in the UV. This predicts anisotropic RG flows from familiar isotropic
fixed points to anisotropic ones. In our case, these RG flows are triggered by
a non-zero theta-angle in Yang-Mills theories that linearly depends on one of
the spatial coordinates. We study the perturbations around these backgrounds
and discuss the possibility of instability. We also holographically compute
their thermal entropies, viscosities, and entanglement entropies.

independent quantum channels in order to stop sudden death of entanglement. In
the adaptation, the quantum filtering does not distill or purify more
entanglement, it rather properly prepares entangled state to the subsequent
quantum channel. For example, the quantum adaptation probabilistically
eliminates the sudden death of entanglement of two-qubit entangled state with
isotropic noise injected into separate amplitude damping channels. The result
has a direct application in quantum key distribution through noisy channels.

A quantum
lattice-gas algorithm (localization-based quantum computation) is employed to
examine the dynamical behavior of vortex soliton solutions of the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation (phi^4 interaction nonlinear Schroedinger equation).
Quantum turbulence is studied in large grid numerical simulations: Kolmogorov
spectrum associated with a Richardson energy cascade occurs on large flow
scales. At intermediate scales a k^{-6} power law emerges, in a
classical-quantum transition from vortex filament reconnections to Kelvin
wave-acoustic wave coupling. The spontaneous exchange of intermediate vortex
rings is observed. Finally, at very small spatial scales a k^{-3} power law
emerges, characterizing fluid dynamics occurring within the scale size of the
vortex cores themselves, a characteristic Kelvin wave cascade region. Poincare
recurrence is studied: in the free non-interacting system, a fast Poincare
recurrence occurs for regular arrays of line vortices. The recurrence period is
used to demarcate dynamics driving the nonlinear quantum fluid towards
turbulence, since fast recurrence is an approximate symmetry of the nonlinear
quantum fluid at early times. This class of quantum algorithms is useful for
studying BEC superfluid dynamics over a broad range of wave numbers, from
quantum flow to a pseudo-classical inviscid flow regime to a Kolmogorov
inertial subrange.

  networks</title><description>  Recent theoretical and experimental investigations of coherent feedback
control, the feedback control of a quantum system with another quantum system,
has raised the important problem of how to synthesize a class of quantum
systems, called the class of linear quantum stochastic systems, from basic
quantum optical components and devices in a systematic way. The synthesis
theory sought in this case can be naturally viewed as a quantum analogue of
linear electrical network synthesis theory and as such has potential for
applications beyond the realization of coherent feedback controllers. In
earlier work, Nurdin, James and Doherty have established that an arbitrary
linear quantum stochastic system can be realized as a cascade connection of
simpler one degree of freedom quantum harmonic oscillators, together with a
direct interaction Hamiltonian which is bilinear in the canonical operators of
the oscillators. However, from an experimental perspective and based on current
methods and technologies, direct interaction Hamiltonians are challenging to
implement for systems with more than just a few degrees of freedom. In order to
facilitate more tractable physical realizations of these systems, this paper
develops a new synthesis algorithm for linear quantum stochastic systems that
relies solely on field-mediated interactions, including in implementation of
the direct interaction Hamiltonian. Explicit synthesis examples are provided to
illustrate the realization of two degrees of freedom linear quantum stochastic
systems using the new algorithm.

molecular properties, which are of practical importance in fields ranging from
materials science to biochemistry. Within chemical precision, the total energy
of a molecule as well as most other properties, can be calculated by solving
the Schrodinger equation. However, the computational resources required to
obtain exact solutions on a conventional computer generally increase
exponentially with the number of atoms involved. This renders such calculations
intractable for all but the smallest of systems. Recently, an efficient
algorithm has been proposed enabling a quantum computer to overcome this
problem by achieving only a polynomial resource scaling with system size. Such
a tool would therefore provide an extremely powerful tool for new science and
technology. Here we present a photonic implementation for the smallest problem:
obtaining the energies of H2, the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis. We
perform a key algorithmic step - the iterative phase estimation algorithm - in
full, achieving a high level of precision and robustness to error. We implement
other algorithmic steps with assistance from a classical computer and explain
how this non-scalable approach could be avoided. Finally, we provide new
theoretical results which lay the foundations for the next generation of
simulation experiments using quantum computers. We have made early experimental
progress towards the long-term goal of exploiting quantum information to speed
up quantum chemistry calculations.

based upon the control of two independent qubit interactions. Further, our

  Combining the nonlinear dynamics that result from the positive feedback with

observable $\Theta$ as a function of the control variables. In this work
control landscapes for open quantum systems governed by Kraus map evolution are
analyzed. Kraus maps are used as the controls transforming an initial density
matrix $\rho_{\rm i}$ into a final density matrix to maximize the expectation
value of the observable $\Theta$. The absence of suboptimal local maxima for
the relevant control landscapes is numerically illustrated. The dependence of
the optimization search effort is analyzed in terms of the dimension of the
system $N$, the initial state $\rho_{\rm i}$, and the target observable
$\Theta$. It is found that if the number of nonzero eigenvalues in $\rho_{\rm
i}$ remains constant, the search effort does not exhibit any significant
dependence on $N$. If $\rho_{\rm i}$ has no zero eigenvalues, then the
computational complexity and the required search effort rise with $N$. The
dimension of the top manifold (i.e., the set of Kraus operators that maximizes
the objective) is found to positively correlate with the optimization search
efficiency. Under the assumption of full controllability, incoherent control
modelled by Kraus maps is found to be more efficient in reaching the same value
of the objective than coherent control modelled by unitary maps. Numerical
simulations are also performed for control landscapes with linear constraints
on the available Kraus maps, and suboptimal maxima are not revealed for these
landscapes.

fidelity transfer of quantum states between the atom and the mechanical
oscillator is in reach for existing or near future experimental parameters. Our
setup provides the basic toolbox for coherent manipulation, preparation and
measurement of micro- and nanomechanical oscillators via the tools of atomic
physics.

providing a reliable/robust treatment of energy-dissipation and dephasing

temperature in a bosonic dissipative network: a chain of coupled harmonic
oscillators whichever its topology, i.e., whichever the way the oscillators are
coupled together, the strength of their couplings and their natural
frequencies. Starting with the case where distinct reservoirs are considered,
each one coupled to a corresponding oscillator, we also analyze the case where
a common reservoir is assigned to the whole network. Master equations are
derived for both situations and both regimes of weak and strong coupling
strengths between the network oscillators. Solutions of these master equations
are presented through the normal ordered characteristic function. We also
present a technique to estimate the decoherence time of network states by
computing separately the effects of diffusion and the attenuation of the
interference terms of the Wigner function. A detailed analysis of the diffusion
mechanism is also presented through the evolution of the Wigner function. The
interesting collective diffusion effects are discussed and applied to the
analysis of decoherence of a class of network states. Finally, the entropy and

network of dissipative harmonic oscillators. We consider ideal sender and
receiver oscillators connected by a chain of nonideal transmitter oscillators
coupled by nearest-neighbor resonances. From the algebraic properties of the
dynamical quantities describing the evolution of the network state, we derive a
criterion, fixing the coupling strengths between all the oscillators, apart
from their natural frequencies, enabling perfect state transfer in the
particular case of ideal transmitter oscillators. Our criterion provides an
easily manipulated formula enabling perfect state transfer in the special case
where the network nonidealities are disregarded. By adjusting the common
frequency of the sender and the receiver oscillators to be out of resonance
with that of the transmitters, we demonstrate that the sender's state tunnels
to the receiver oscillator by virtually exciting the nonideal transmitter
chain. This virtual process makes negligible the decay rate associated with the
transmitter line on the expenses of delaying the time interval for the state
transfer process. Apart from our analytical results, numerical computations are
presented to illustrate our protocol.

photonic qubits by well controlled two photon interactions. However, the
dependence of the non-linear interaction on frequency and time makes it
difficult to preserve a coherent pulse shape that could justify a single mode
model for the time-frequency degree of freedom of the photons. In this paper,
we analyze the problem of temporal multi-mode effects by considering the pulse
shape of the average output field obtained from a coherent input pulse. It is
shown that a significant part of the two photon state transformation can be
derived from this semi-classical description of the optical non-linearity. The
effect of a non-linear system on a two photon state can then be determined from
the density matrix dynamics of the coherently driven system using input-output
theory. As an example, the resonant non-linearity of a single two level atom is
characterized. The results indicate that the most efficient non-linear effect
may not be the widely studied single mode phase shift, but the transfer of one

properties.

orders of the small ratio $\epsilon$ of the characteristic times. It is known
that in the order $\epsilon^0$ the particle gets an additional
[Born-Oppenheimer] potential, while in the order $\eps^1$ it feels an effective
magnetic field related to the Berry phase. In the order $\epsilon^2$ the motion
of the classical particle can be reduced to a free [geodesic] motion on a
curved Riemannian manifold, with the metric generated by the excluded quantum
system. This motion has a number of unusual features, e.g., it combines
subspaces of different (Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian) signature for the
metric tensor. In the order $\epsilon^3$ the motion of the classical particle
is still described by a Lagrangian, but the latter linearly depends on the
particle's acceleration. This implies the existence of a spin tensor
[non-orbital angular momentum] for the particle. This spin tensor is related to
the momentum via an analogue of the zitterbewegung effect. The Hamiltonian
structure of the system is non-trivial and is defined via non-linear Poisson
brackets. The linear dependence of the effective classical Lagrangian on
higher-order derivatives is seen as well in the higher orders $\epsilon^n$.

errors with equal probability, the effective error rate is significantly

consider quadripartite systems prepared in bipartite product states of the form
$|\Psi&gt; = |\psi&gt;_{12} \otimes |\psi&gt;_{34}$ and let the uncorrelated subsystems
14 and 23 interact by a given unitary $U_{14}\otimes U_{23}$: we show that the

the occurrence of this phenomenon both in continuous variable and qubit
systems, and discuss its possible applications to bath engineering, double

classical secrets. While every quantum secret sharing scheme is a quantum error
correcting code, the converse is not true. Motivated by this we sought to find
quantum codes which can be converted to secret sharing schemes. If we are
interested in sharing classical secrets using quantum information, then we show
that a class of pure $[[n,1,d]]_q$ CSS codes can be converted to perfect secret
sharing schemes. These secret sharing schemes are perfect in the sense the
unauthorized parties do not learn anything about the secret. Gottesman had
given conditions to test whether a given subset is an authorized or
unauthorized set; they enable us to determine the access structure of quantum
secret sharing schemes. For the secret sharing schemes proposed in this paper
the access structure can be characterized in terms of minimal codewords of the
classical code underlying the CSS code. This characterization of the access
structure for quantum secret sharing schemes is thought to be new.

metallic films of nanometric thickness. The force is calculated by the Lifshitz
formula with the film dielectric tensor derived from the one-electron energies
and wavefunctions under the assumption of a constant potential inside the film
and a uniform distribution of the positive ion charge. The results show that
quantization effects tend to reduce the force with respect to the continuum
plasma model. The reduction is more significant at low electron densities and
for film size of the order of few nanometers and persists for separation
distances up to 10 nm. Comparison with previous work indicates that the
softening of the boundary potential is important in determining the amount of
the reduction. The calculations are extended to treat Drude intraband
absorption. It is shown that the inclusion of relaxation time enhances the size
quantization effects in the force calculations.

Svetlichny [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{89}, 060401 (2002)] to investigate the GME

this model with weak magnetic field are fully entangled. Since this model can
be simulated with nuclear magnetic resonance, our results provide a fresh

simultaneously, however they become maximally complementary if their
eigenstates are mutually unbiased. Only then the measurement of one observable
gives no information about the other observable. The spin projection operators
onto three mutually orthogonal directions are maximally complementary only for
the spin 1/2. For the higher spin numbers they are no longer unbiased. In this
work we examine the properties of spin 1 Mutually Unbiased Bases (MUBs) and
look for the physical meaning of the corresponding operators. We show that if
the computational basis is chosen to be the eigenbasis of the spin projection
operator onto some direction z, the states of the other MUBs have to be
squeezed. Then, we introduce the analogs of momentum and position operators and
interpret what information about the spin vector the observer gains while
measuring them. Finally, we study the generation and the measurement of MUBs
states by introducing the Fourier like transform through spin squeezing. The
higher spin numbers are also considered.

transition, regions of criticality and scaling behavior in the vicinity of a

order parameter, and entanglement entropy, which have direct relation with
Bogolyubov transformation. We diagonalized the Hamiltonian in XY spin-chain

the energy spectrum but not the coefficients of the Bogolyubov transformation

critical magnetic field of quantum phase transitions and not induce new
critical regions in the XY spin model. Moreover, we further prove the ideas by
the methods of geometric phases in this model.

coherent state triplets are special in that they lie close to an hexagonal

based on the lattice of closed linear subspaces of some Hilbert space, or, more
generally, on the lattice of projections in a von Neumann algebra A.
Unfortunately, the logical interpretation of these lattices is impaired by
their nondistributivity and by various other problems. We show that a possible
resolution of these difficulties, suggested by the ideas of Bohr, emerges if
instead of single projections one considers elementary propositions to be
families of projections indexed by a partially ordered set C(A) of appropriate
commutative subalgebras of A. In fact, to achieve both maximal generality and
ease of use within topos theory, we assume that A is a so-called Rickart
C*-algebra and that C(A) consists of all unital commutative Rickart
C*-subalgebras of A. Such families of projections form a Heyting algebra in a
natural way, so that the associated propositional logic is intuitionistic:
distributivity is recovered at the expense of the law of the excluded middle.
  Subsequently, generalizing an earlier computation for n-by-n matrices, we
prove that the Heyting algebra thus associated to A arises as a basis for the
internal Gelfand spectrum (in the sense of Banaschewski-Mulvey) of the
&quot;Bohrification&quot; of A, which is a commutative Rickart C*-algebra in the topos of
functors from C(A) to the category of sets. We explain the relationship of this
construction to partial Boolean algebras and Bruns-Lakser completions. Finally,
we establish a connection between probability measure on the lattice of
projections on a Hilbert space H and probability valuations on the internal
Gelfand spectrum of A for A = B(H).

that the interference contrast in a three-grating atom interferometer does not
vanish under the presence of scattering events with photons, as required by the
complementarity principle. In this work we provide an analytical study of this
experiment, determining the evolution of the atom wave function along the
three-grating Mach-Zehnder interferometer under the assumption that the atom is
hit by a photon after passing through the first grating. The consideration of a
transverse wave function in momentum representation is essential in this study.
As is shown, the number of atoms transmitted through the third grating is given
by a simple periodic function of the lateral shift along this grating, both in
the absence and in the presence of photon scattering. Moreover, the relative
contrast (laser on/laser off) is shown to be a simple analytical function of
the ratio d_p/\lambda_i, where d_p is the distance between atomic paths at the
scattering locus and \lambda_i the scattered photon wavelength. We argue that
this dependence, being in agreement with experimental results, can be regarded
to show compatibility of the wave and corpuscle properties of atoms.

the only input is N, provided in binary. We show that the classical problem is
NEXP-complete and the quantum problem is QMA_EXP-complete. Thus, an algorithm

Making use of the fact that the time evolution of a response function is

the equation of motion for the reduced density operator, including the term for
the initial correlation between the system and a thermal bath. In this

example, it gives only probabilistic predictions (non-determinism) and does not
allow copying of unknown state (no-cloning). Quantum correlations may be
stronger than any classical ones, nevertheless information cannot be
transmitted faster than light (no-signaling). However, all these features do
not single out quantum physics. A broad class of theories exist which share
such traits with quantum mechanics, while they allow even stronger than quantum
correlations. Here, we introduce the principle of Information Causality. It
states that information that Bob can gain about a previously completely unknown
to him data set of Alice, by using all his local resources (which may be
correlated with her resources) and a classical communication from her, is
bounded by the information volume of the communication. In other words, if
Alice communicates m bits to Bob, the total information access that Bob gains
to her data is not greater than m. For m=0, Information Causality reduces to
the standard no-signaling principle. We show that this new principle is
respected both in classical and quantum physics, whereas it is violated by all
the no-signaling correlations which are stronger that the strongest quantum
correlations. Maximally strong no-signalling correlations would allow Bob
access to any m bit subset of the whole data set held by Alice. If only one bit
is sent by Alice (m=1), this is tantamount to Bob being able to access the
value of any single bit of Alice's data (but of course not all of them). We
suggest that Information Causality, a generalization of no-signaling, might be
one of the foundational properties of Nature.

the distance or angle to the nearest unentangled state. This geometric measure
of entanglement is explored for bi-partite and multi-partite pure and mixed
states. It is determined analytically for arbitrary two-qubit mixed states,
generalized Werner, and isotropic states, and is also applied to certain

represent one of the most vital theoretical aspect of quantum information
processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting
field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic
obstacle to the development of large scale quantum computers. The introduction
of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be
employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and
fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes,
techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction
for large scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize
the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a
detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. This development in this
area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information,
specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused
on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it
difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in
this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical
and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and
fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to
experimentalists today and in the near future.

somewhat unconventional manner. Our main focus will be on monoidal categories,
mostly symmetric ones, for which we propose a physical interpretation. These
are particularly relevant for quantum foundations and for quantum informatics.
Special attention is given to the category which has finite dimensional Hilbert
spaces as objects, linear maps as morphisms, and the tensor product as its
monoidal structure (FdHilb). We also provide a detailed discussion of the
category which has sets as objects, relations as morphisms, and the cartesian
product as its monoidal structure (Rel), and thirdly, categories with manifolds
as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms (2Cob). While sets,
Hilbert spaces and manifolds do not share any non-trivial common structure,
these three categories are in fact structurally very similar. Shared features
are diagrammatic calculus, compact closed structure and particular kinds of
internal comonoids which play an important role in each of them. The categories
FdHilb and Rel moreover admit a categorical matrix calculus. Together these
features guide us towards topological quantum field theories. We also discuss
posetal categories, how group representations are in fact categorical
constructs, and what strictification and coherence of monoidal categories is
all about. In our attempt to complement the existing literature we omitted some
very basic topics. For these we refer the reader to other available sources.

proposed for quantum information processing recently. By the methods presented
in this paper a bi-photonic qutrit, which is encoded with the polarizations of
two photons in the same spatial-temporal mode, can be mapped to a single photon
qutrit in spatial modes. It will make arbitrary unitary operation on such
bi-photonic qutrit possible if we can also realize the inverse map to
polarization space. Among the two schemes proposed in this paper, the one based
only on linear optics realizes an arbitrary U(3) operation with a very small
success probability. However, if added with weak nonlinearity, the success
probability can be greatly improved. These schemes are feasible with the

addressed aiming at resolving the seeming paradox that arises when one resorts
to the adiabatic representation. In this picture, the eigenvalues and
eigenfunctions of a time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii Hamiltonian are also
functions of time. Since the level energies vary in time, no definite
transition frequency can be introduced. Hence no external modulation with a
fixed frequency can be made resonant. Thus, the resonant generation of
adiabatic coherent modes is impossible. However, this paradox occurs only in
the frame of the adiabatic picture. It is shown that no paradox exists in the
properly formulated diabatic representation. The resonant generation of
diabatic coherent modes is a well defined phenomenon. As an example, the
equations are derived, describing the generation of diabatic coherent modes by
the combined resonant modulation of the trapping potential and atomic
scattering length.

complementary approaches are used which account for correlation in an
approximate manner: time-dependent density-functional theory and a
single-active-electron model. For intensities I~10^{14} W/cm^2, the theories
are in remarkably good agreement for the dynamic polarization and harmonic
spectrum. This is attributed to a low-frequency collective mode together with a
high-frequency single-electron response due to the nuclear singularity, both of
which dominate electron correlation effects. A time-frequency analysis is used
to study the timing and emission spectrum of attosecond bursts of light. For
short pulses, we find a secondary maximum below the classical cut-off. The

appears at frequencies above the high-frequency drop-off, consistent with

everyday notions and thus in terms of classical physics. This necessity is
behind each of our attempt to extract meaning out of empirical data and to
communicate this knowledge to others. As such, it must apply also to the
account of measurement arrangements and to the outcome in quantum experiments.
On the other hand, however, if quantum mechanics is universally valid it should
be possible to give a purely quantum mechanical description of objects of
increasingly large sizes, eventually of the measurement devices themselves. It
is suggested to resolve this dilemma by using the method of von Weizsaecker's
circular and consistent movement in a reconstruction (Kreisgang) in which it is
legitimate to recover the elements with which one started the reconstruction.
The parameters entering the complex amplitudes of a quantum state have an
operational meaning as parameters that specify the configuration of macroscopic
instruments by which the state is prepared and measured. This classical aspect
in each quantum description is at the &quot;beginning&quot; of the Kreisgang. The
Kreisgang is &quot;closed&quot; by showing that under the every-day conditions of
coarse-grained measurements a description of macroscopic instruments emerges in

Choosing initial conditions that manifest the so-called sudden death of
entanglement, we compare the dynamics of entanglement with that of quantum
discord. We show that in all cases where entanglement suddenly disappears,
quantum discord vanishes only in the asymptotic limit, behaving similarly to
individual decoherence of the qubits, even at finite temperatures. Hence,
quantum discord is more robust than the entanglement against to decoherence so
that quantum algorithms based only on quantum discord correlations may be more

quantum dots and atoms. We show that the interactions lead to a phenomenon of
periodic disentanglement and entanglement between the qubits. The
disentanglement is primarily caused by environmental perturbations. The qubits
are seen to remain disentangled for a finite time before getting entangled
again. We find that the phenomenon is generic and occurs for wide variety of

If the angle is very small, the statistical correlation between bits

Quantum Computation (ADQC) combines aspects of the quantum circuit and the
one-way model to overcome challenging issues in building large-scale quantum
computers. Instead of directly manipulating each qubit to perform universal
quantum logic gates or measurements, ADQC uses a fixed two-qubit interaction to
couple the memory register of a quantum computer to an ancilla qubit. By
measuring the ancilla, the measurement-induced back-action on the system
performs the desired logical operations.
  By demanding that the ancilla-system qubit interaction should lead to unitary
and stepwise deterministic evolution, and that it should be possible to
standardise the computation, that is, applying all global operations at the
beginning, we are able to place conditions on the interactions that can be used
for ADQC. We prove there are only two such classes of interactions
characterised in terms of the non-local part of the interaction operator. This
leads to the definition of a new entanglement resource called twisted graph
states generated from non-commuting operators. The ADQC model is formalised in
an algebraic framework similar to the Measurement Calculus. Furthermore, we
present the notion of causal flow for twisted graph states, based on the
stabiliser formalism, to characterise the determinism. Finally we demonstrate
compositional embedding between ADQC and both the one-way and circuit models
which will allow us to transfer recently developed theory and toolkits of
measurement-based quantum computing directly into ADQC.

expansion in quantum fluctuations around one of the classical limits. We
explicitly analyze expansions around three such limits: (i) corpuscular or
Newtonian limit in the coordinate-momentum representation, (ii) wave or
Gross-Pitaevskii limit for interacting bosons in the coherent state
representation, and (iii) Bloch limit for the spin systems. We discuss both the
semiclassical (truncated Wigner) approximation and further quantum corrections
appearing in the form of either stochastic quantum jumps along the classical
trajectories or the nonlinear response to such jumps. We also discuss how
quantum jumps naturally emerge in the analysis of non-equal time correlation
functions. This representation of quantum dynamics is closely related to the
phase space methods based on the Wigner-Weyl quantization and to the Keldysh
technique. We show how such concepts as the Wigner function, Weyl symbol, Moyal

path integral representation of the evolution in the Heisenberg representation.
We illustrate the applicability of this expansion with various examples mostly

two-dimensional Bose Hubbard model, Dicke model and others.

  is tight</title><description>  The question of how fast a quantum state can evolve has attracted a
considerable attention in connection with quantum measurement, metrology, and
information processing. Since only orthogonal states can be unambiguously
distinguished, a transition from a state to an orthogonal one can be taken as
the elementary step of a computational process. Therefore, such a transition
can be interpreted as the operation of &quot;flipping a qubit&quot;, and the number of
orthogonal states visited by the system per unit time can be viewed as the
maximum rate of operation.
  A lower bound on the orthogonalization time, based on the energy spread
DeltaE, was found by Mandelstam and Tamm. Another bound, based on the average
energy E, was established by Margolus and Levitin. The bounds coincide, and can
be exactly attained by certain initial states if DeltaE=E; however, the problem
remained open of what the situation is otherwise.
  Here we consider the unified bound that takes into account both DeltaE and E.
We prove that there exist no initial states that saturate the bound if DeltaE
is not equal to E. However, the bound remains tight: for any given values of
DeltaE and E, there exists a one-parameter family of initial states that can
approach the bound arbitrarily close when the parameter approaches its limit
value. The relation between the largest energy level, the average energy, and
the orthogonalization time is also discussed. These results establish the
fundamental quantum limit on the rate of operation of any
information-processing system.

system described by the two-lead Anderson model. We exactly obtain the
transition rate between the non-entangled incident state in one lead and the
outgoing spin-singlet state in the other lead. In the cotunneling process, only
the spin-singlet state can transmit. To discuss such an entanglement property
in the open quantum system, we construct the exact two-electron scattering

spin-singlet bound states induced by the Coulomb interaction. The bound state
describes the scattering process in which the set of momenta is not conserved
and hence it is not in the form of a Bethe eigenstate.

states of noninteracting electrons, Nagaoka and Gutzwiller states of
strongly-correlated electrons, and superconducting states. Uncorrelated
metallic states at half filling seem to maximize entanglement, as these states
optimize the number of holes, the number of doubly-occupied sites. Entanglement
is calculated explicitly for Gutzwiller-projected many-electron states in one

these states. Entanglement in superconducting states, which tend to promote
double occupancy, is calculated as a function of the energy gap, and found to
be lower than the metallic state entanglement. There is a possibility of a

the oscillator frequency -- and further assume the classical noises are
Markovian, which captures the main feature of a broadband GW detector. Besides,
we consider verifications of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) type entanglements
between macroscopic test masses in GW detectors, which enables to test one

microscopic expressions of the Fano parameters that describe the three types of
the Fano asymmetry. One of the expressions indicate that the corresponding Fano

are studied in the semi-classical approach to the well-defined quantum model.
It is shown that near the initial cosmological singularity point quantum
gravity effects ~ h exhibit themselves in the form of additional matter source
with the negative pressure and the equation of state as for ultrastiff matter.
The analytical solution of the equations of theory of gravity, in which matter
is represented by the radiation and additional matter source of quantum nature,
is found. It is shown that in the stage of the evolution of the universe, when
quantum corrections ~ h dominate over the radiation, the geometry of the
universe is described by the metric which is conformal to a metric of a unit
four-sphere in a five-dimensional Euclidean flat space. In the radiation
dominated era the metric is found to be conformal to a unit hyperboloid
embedded in a five-dimensional Lorentz-signatured flat space. The origin of the
universe can be interpreted as a quantum transition of the system from the
region in a phase space with a trajectory in imaginary time into the region,
where the equations of motion have the solution in real time. Near the boundary
between two regions the universe undergoes almost an exponential expansion
which passes smoothly into the expansion under the action of radiation
dominating over matter. As a result of such a quantum transition the geometry
of the universe changes. This agrees with the hypothesis about the possible
change of geometry after the nucleation of expanding universe from `nothing'.

quantum superpositions when a system has interacted with a sufficiently large
number of degrees of freedom of the environment. This is due to the fact that
gravity imposes fundamental limitations on how accurate measurements can be.
This leads to the notion of undecidability: there is no way to tell, due to
fundamental limitations, if a quantum system evolved unitarily or suffered
wavefunction collapse. This in turn provides a solution to the problem of
outcomes in quantum measurement by providing a sharp criterion for defining
when an event has taken place. We analyze in detail in examples two situations
in which in principle one could recover information about quantum coherence: a)
&quot;revivals&quot; of coherence in the interaction of a system with the environment and
b) the measurement of global observables of the system plus apparatus plus
environment. We show in the examples that the fundamental limitations due to
gravity and quantum mechanics in measurement prevent both revivals from
occurring and the measurement of global observables. It can therefore be argued
that the emerging picture provides a complete resolution to the measurement
problem in quantum mechanics.

advantages in real-life implementations as it does not require fast optical
switching or a quantum random number generator. The essential idea is to use a

source using a cross-estimate technique without active routing of each pulse.
We have derived analytical expressions for the passive estimation scheme.
Moreover, using simulations, we have considered four real-life imperfections:
Additional loss introduced by the &quot;plug &amp; play&quot; structure, inefficiency of the
intensity monitor, noise of the intensity monitor, and statistical fluctuation
introduced by finite data size. Our simulation results show that the passive

possible to implement the &quot;plug &amp; play&quot; QKD with the security guaranteed, while

gas-phase neutral atoms rely increasingly on laser cooling and optical,
magneto-optical or magnetostatic trapping methods to provide atomic
localization with sub-micron uncertainty. Difficult to achieve in free space,
this goal is further frustrated by atom-surface interactions if the desired
atomic placement approaches within several hundred nanometers of a solid
surface, as can be the case in setups incorporating monolithic dielectric
optical resonators such as microspheres, microtoroids, microdisks or photonic
crystal defect cavities. Typically in such scenarios, the smallest atom-surface
separation at which the van der Waals interaction can be neglected is taken to
be the optimal localization point for associated trapping schemes, but this
sort of conservative strategy generally compromises the achievable cavity QED
coupling strength. Here we suggest a new approach to the design of optical
dipole traps for atom confinement near surfaces that exploits strong surface
interactions, rather than avoiding them, and present the results of a numerical
study based on $^{39}$K atoms and indium tin oxide (ITO). Our theoretical
framework points to the possibility of utilizing nanopatterning methods to

apriori labeled and unlabeled outcomes. In both cases we can unambiguously
conclude only that the measurements are different. For the labeled case it is
sufficient to use each unknown measurement only once and the average
conditional success probability decreases with the Hilbert space dimension as
1/d. If the outcomes of the apparatuses are not labeled, then the problem is
more complicated. We analyze the case of two-dimensional Hilbert space. In this
case single shot comparison is impossible and each measurement device must be
used (at least) twice. The optimal test state in the two-shots scenario gives
the average conditional success probability 3/4. Interestingly, the optimal
experiment detects unambiguously the difference with nonvanishing probability
for any pair of observables.

postulate (determining post-measurement states) in QI and the difference
between its L\&quot;uders and von Neumann versions. These projection postulates
differ crucially in the case of observables with degenerate spectra. Such
observables play the fundamental role in operations with entangled states: any
measurement on one subsystem is represented by an observable with degenerate
spectrum in the Hilbert space of a composite system. If von Neumann was right
and L\&quot;uders was wrong the canonical schemes of quantum teleportation and ``one

von Neumann's description of measurements via refinement implies (under natural

where commutativity of group elements can be expressed in the geometric
language of symplectic polar spaces embedded in the projective spaces PG($n,
p$), $n$ being odd and $p$ a prime. Here, we present a result about commuting
and non-commuting group elements based on the existence of so-called Moebius
pairs of $n$-simplices, i. e., pairs of $n$-simplices which are \emph{mutually
inscribed and circumscribed} to each other. For group elements representing an
$n$-simplex there is no element outside the centre which commutes with all of
them. This allows to express the dimension $n$ of the associated polar space in
group theoretic terms. Any Moebius pair of $n$-simplices according to our
construction corresponds to two disjoint families of group elements (operators)
with the following properties: (i) Any two distinct elements of the same family
do not commute. (ii) Each element of one family commutes with all but one of
the elements from the other family. A three-qubit generalised Pauli group
serves as a non-trivial example to illustrate the theory for $p=2$ and $n=5$.

non-abelian anyons in sight. I offer some speculations on the crucial pieces of
superconducting hardware that could be demonstrated in the next couple of years
that would be clear stepping stones towards this surface-code architecture.

necessarily yield its D-1-dimensional analog version. Among other things, this
result will depend on the boundary conditions and the dimension D of the
system. We investigate this question for scalar and abelian gauge fields under
boundary conditions that obey the symmetries of the action. We apply our
findings to the Casimir piston, an ideal system for detecting boundary effects.
Our investigation is not limited to extra dimensions and we show that the
original piston scenario proposed in 2004, a toy model involving a scalar field
in 3D (2+1)dimensions, can be obtained via dimensional reduction from a more
realistic 4D electromagnetic (EM) system. We show that for perfect conductor
conditions, a D-dimensional EM field reduces to a D-1 scalar field and not its
lower-dimensional version. For Dirichlet boundary conditions, no theory is
recovered under dimensional reduction and the Casimir pressure goes to zero in
any dimension. This &quot;zero Dirichlet&quot; result is useful for understanding the EM
case. We then identify two special systems where the lower-dimensional version
is recovered in any dimension: systems with perfect magnetic conductor (PMC)
and Neumann boundary conditions. We show that these two boundary conditions can
be obtained from a variational procedure in which the action vanishes outside
the bounded region. The fields are free to vary on the surface and have zero
modes which survive after dimensional reduction.

extension of the traditional model of a bath of oscillators which is capable of
inducing an effective coupling between the two parts of the system depending on
the choice made for the spectral density of the bath. The coupling is nonlinear
in the system variables and an exponential dependence on these variables is
imposed in order to guarantee the translational invariance of the model if the
two particles are not subject to any external potential. The reduced density
operator is obtained by the functional integral method. The dynamical
susceptibility of the reservoir is modelled in order to introduce, besides a
characteristic frequency, a characteristic length that determines if the
effective interaction potential is strong enough to induce entanglement between
the particles. Our model provides a criterion of distance for identifying in
which cases a common environment can induce entanglement. Three regimes are
found: the short distance regime, equivalent to a bilinear system-reservoir
coupling, the long distance regime in which the particles act like coupled to
independent reservoirs and the intermediate regime suitable for the competition
between decoherence and induced-entanglement.

(and generalisation) of Copenhagen quantum mechanics in the image of classical
stochastic theories. These classical models lend themselves to a simple
interpretation in which a single history (a single element of the sample space)
is deemed to be 'real'; we require only that this real history should not be
ruled out by the dynamics, the axioms of which ensure that not all histories
are precluded. However, applying this interpretation naively to quantum measure
theory we can find experimentally realisable systems (notably the
Peres-Kochen-Specker system) in which every history is ruled out by the
dynamics, challenging us to formulate a deeper realist framework.
  Our first response is to hold on to our existing interpretative framework and
attempt a revision of the dynamics that would reduce quantum measure theory to
a classical dynamics. We explore this approach by examining the histories
formulation of a stochastic-collapse model on a simple (discrete) null-lattice,
concluding that the drawbacks of this approach outweigh the benefits.
  Our second response is to abandon our classically inspired interpretation in
favour of Sorkin's 'co-events', a more general ontology that still allows for
strict realism. In this case the 'potentially real' objects of the theory (the
'beables' in Bell's language) are not individual histories but truth valuation
maps, or co-events. We develop &amp; evaluate various co-event schemes that have
been suggested to date, finally adopting the multiplicative scheme; the current
working model of co-event theory and a promising interpretation of quantum
measure theory, though still a work in progress. We conclude by exploring the
expression of the dynamics &amp; predictions in this new framework.

microwaves. An ion crystal represents a spatial ensemble of qubits, but the
effects of inhomogeneities across a typical crystal are small, and as such we
treat the ensemble as a single effective spin. We are able to initialize the
qubits in a simple state and perform a projective measurement on the system. We
demonstrate full control of the qubit Bloch vector, performing arbitrary
high-fidelity rotations ($\tau_{\pi}\sim$200 $\mu$s). Randomized Benchmarking
demonstrates an error per gate (a Pauli-randomized $\pi/2$ and $\pi$ pulse
pair) of $8\pm1\times10^{-4}$. Ramsey interferometry and spin-locking
measurements are used to elucidate the limits of qubit coherence in the system,
yielding a typical free-induction decay coherence time of $T_{2}\sim$2 ms, and
a limiting $T_{1\rho}\sim$688 ms. These experimental specifications make ion
crystals in a Penning trap ideal candidates for novel experiments in quantum

error-suppressing capabilities of dynamical decoupling pulse sequences,
demonstrating an ability to extend qubit coherence and suppress phase errors.
We conclude with a discussion of future avenues for experimental exploration,
including the use of additional nuclear-spin-flip transitions for effective
multiqubit protocols, and the potential for Coulomb crystals to form a useful

Information Processing (QIP) system is a complicated task. The design of an
experimentally feasible quantum processor must draw upon results in multiple
fields; from experimental efforts in system control and fabrication through to
far more abstract areas such as quantum algorithms and error correction.
Recently, the adaptation of topological coding models to physical systems in
optics has illustrated a possible long term pathway to truly large scale QIP.
As the topological model has well defined protocols for Quantum Error
Correction (QEC) built in as part of its construction, a more grounded analysis
of the {\em classical} processing requirements is possible. In this paper we
analyze the requirements for a classical processing system, designed
specifically for the topological cluster state model. We demonstrate that via
extensive parallelization, the construction of a classical &quot;front-end&quot; system
capable of processing error correction data for a large topological computer is

the deformed algebra with new effective deformation parameters. As a
consequence, a two-particle system can be reduced to a one-particle problem for
the internal motion. As an example, the correction to the hydrogen atom $n$S
energy levels is re-evaluated. Comparison with high-precision experimental data
leads to an upper bound of the minimal length for the electron equal to
$3.3\times 10^{-18} {\rm m}$. The effective Hamiltonian describing the
center-of-mass motion of a macroscopic body in an external potential is also
found. For such a motion, the effective deformation parameter is substantially
reduced due to a factor $1/N^2$. This explains the strangely small result
previously obtained for the minimal length from a comparison with the observed
precession of the perihelion of Mercury. From our study, an upper bound of the

supposed to be a function of only hidden variable. We point out that the true
implication of the probability distribution of Bell's correlation function is
the distribution of the joint measurement outcomes on the two sides. So it is a
function of both hidden variable and settings. In this case, Bell's
inequalities fail. Our further analysis shows that Bell's locality holds
neither for dependent events nor for independent events. We think that the
measurements of EPR pairs are dependent events, thus violation of Bell's
inequalities cannot rule out the existence of local hidden variable. In order
to explain the results of EPR-type experiments, we suppose that polarization
entangled photon pair can be composed of two circularly or linearly polarized
photons with correlated hidden variables, and a couple of experiments of
quantum measurement are proposed. The first uses delayed measurement on one
photon of the EPR pair to demonstrate directly whether measurement on the other
could have any non-local influence on it. Then several experiments are
suggested to reveal the components of polarization entangled photon pair. The
last one uses successive polarization measurements on a pair of EPR photons to
show that two photons with a same quantum state will behave in the same way
under the same measuring condition.

d^2 distinct messages. If |Psi&gt; is not maximally entangled, then Ji et al.
[Phys. Rev. A 73, 034307 (2006)] have shown that under the original
deterministic dense-coding protocol, in which messages are encoded by unitary
operations performed on Alice's qudit, it is impossible to encode d^2-1
messages. Encoding d^2-2 is possible; see, e.g., the numerical studies by Mozes
et al. [Phys. Rev. A 71, 012311 (2005)]. Answering a question raised by Wu et
al. [Phys. Rev. A 73, 042311 (2006)], we show that when |Psi&gt; is not maximally

requirement that Alice encode by unitary operations on her qudit is weakened to
allow encoding by more general quantum operators. We then describe a
dense-coding protocol that can overcome this limitation with high probability,
assuming the largest Schmidt coefficient of |Psi&gt; is sufficiently close to
sqrt(1/d). In this protocol, d^2-2 of the messages are encoded via unitary
operations on Alice's qudit, and the final (d^2-1)-th message is encoded via a

Interference patterns correspond to attractors of RDS. There exists a large

of statistical experiment does not depend on noise in the equipment. On the one
hand, we support the corpuscular model, because a quantum particle can be
described as a corpuscular object. On the other hand, our model does not differ
strongly from the wave model, because a quantum particle interacts with the
whole equipment. Hence the interaction has nonlocal character. For example, in
the two slit experiment a quantum particle interacts with both slits (but it

  the de Broglie-Bohm Quantum Potential</title><description>  The paper proposes an envelope soliton model of the electron that propagates
as a protuberance on a fictitious waveguide, which acts as trajectory. The
model is based on de Broglie's original electron wave-particle relativistic
theory, and on the observation that the Klein-Gordon equation governs the
propagation mode of a common microwave waveguide - with the Schroedinger
equation as a low group velocity approximation. This analogy opened for
practical physical models, including solitons. In the linear case a conceived
corpuscle zigzags within the fictitious waveguide - a zigzagging that resembles
Penrose's picture of Dirac's electron theory. The soliton envelope is defined
by a special nonlinear version of the Schroedinger equation. The nonlinearity
cancels the de Broglie/Bohm Quantum Potential of the envelope. The wavefunction
is confined by the envelope, and thus the concept of the collapse of the
wavefunction is eliminated. Since the electron model is based directly on the
Special theory of relativity it also illustrates that theory. The corpuscle,
incorporating spin and charge, which moves at the speed of light, needs further
study relating it to the photon. A model of the photon based on the mutual
coupling of two modes of an optical fiber at the Planck scale, is suggested.
One of these modes is thought to carry two orthogonal polarized electromagnetic
external fields, while the other, internal, mode carries a corpuscle that moves
helically and thus represents the spin. A single electron is considered to have
one polarization only, without any superposition possibility; hence, the
concept of collapse in a polarization measurement is eliminated.

  of neutral atoms</title><description>  Experimental tests of Bell's inequality allow to distinguish quantum
mechanics from local hidden variable theories. Such tests are performed by
measuring correlations of two entangled particles (e.g. polarization of photons
or spins of atoms). In order to constitute conclusive evidence, two conditions
have to be satisfied. First, strict separation of the measurement events in the
sense of special relativity is required (&quot;locality loophole&quot;). Second, almost
all entangled pairs have to be detected (for particles in a maximally entangled
state the required detector efficiency is 82.8%), which is hard to achieve
experimentally (&quot;detection loophole&quot;). By using the recently demonstrated
entanglement between single trapped atoms and single photons it becomes
possible to entangle two atoms at a large distance via entanglement swapping.
Combining the high detection efficiency achieved with atoms with the space-like
separation of the atomic state detection events, both loopholes can be closed
within the same experiment. In this paper we present estimations based on
current experimental achievements which show that such an experiment is
feasible in future.

representing an imprecise control of the fields driving the evolution; the
other due to an interaction between the two near qubits. The peculiar level
structure underlying the holonomic operator leads us to introduce the reduced
logical entanglement which is the fraction of entanglement in the logical

determining the limitations of cooling to absolute zero. We find that if the
energy spectrum of the working medium possesses an uncontrollable gap, then
there is a minimum achievable temperature above zero. Such a gap, combined with
a negligible amount of noise, prevents adiabatic following during the
demagnetization stage which is the necessary condition for reaching $T_c \to
0$. The refrigerator is based on an Otto cycle where the working medium is an
interacting spin system with an energy gap. For this system the external
control Hamiltonian does not commute with the internal interaction. As a result
during the demagnetization and magnetization segments of the operating cycle
the system cannot follow adiabatically the temporal change in the energy
levels. We connect the nonadiabatic dynamics to quantum friction. An adiabatic
measure is defined characterizing the rate of change of the Hamiltonian. Closed
form solutions are found for a constant adiabatic measure for all the cycle
segments. We have identified a family of quantized frictionless cycles with
increasing cycle times. These cycles minimize the entropy production. Such
frictionless cycles are able to cool to $T_c=0$. External noise on the controls
eliminates these frictionless cycles. The influence of phase and amplitude
noise on the demagnetization and magnetization segments is explicitly derived.
An extensive numerical study of optimal cooling cycles was carried out which
showed that at sufficiently low temperature the noise always dominates
restricting the minimum temperature.

(arXiv:0905.4673 [hep-th]) that the C-operator related to a PT-symmetric
non-Hermitian Hamilton operator is not unique. Moreover it has been remarked by
Shi and Sun (arXiv:0905.1771 [hep-th]) very recently that there seems to exist
a well defined inner product in the context of the Hamilton operator of the
PT-symmetric non-Hermitian Lee model yielding a different C-operator as
compared to the one previously derived by Bender et al.. The puzzling
observations of both manuscripts are reconciled and explained in the present
manuscript as follows: the actual form of the metric operator (and the induced
C-operator) related to some non-Hermitian Hamilton operator constructed along
the lines of Shi and Su depends on the chosen normalization of the left and
right eigenvectors of the Hamilton operator under consideration and is
therefore ambiguous. For a specific PT-symmetric 2x2-matrix Hamilton operator
it is shown that - by a suitable choice of the norm of its eigenvectors - the
metric operator yielding a positive semi-definite inner product can be made
even independent of the parameters of the considered Hamilton operator. This
surprising feature makes in turn the obtained metric operator rather unique and
attractive. For later convenience the metric operator for the Bosonic and
Fermionic (anti)causal harmonic oscillator is derived.

lattice, using an attractive mixture of mass-imbalanced bosons. Starting from a
&quot;molecular&quot; quantum crystal, supersolidity is induced dynamically as an
out-of-equilibrium state. When neighboring molecular wavefunctions overlap,
both bosonic species simultaneously exhibit quasi-condensation and long-range
solid order, which is stabilized by their mass imbalance. Supersolidity appears
in a perfect one-dimensional crystal, without the requirement of doping. Our
model can be realized in present experiments with bosonic mixtures that feature
simple on-site interactions, clearing the path to the observation of
supersolidity.

  wave functions</title><description>  We study the Shannon entropy of the probability distribution resulting from
the ground-state wave function of a one-dimensional quantum model. This entropy
is related to the entanglement entropy of a Rokhsar-Kivelson-type wave function
built from the corresponding two-dimensional classical model. In both critical
and massive cases, we observe that it is composed of an extensive part
proportional to the length of the system and a subleading universal constant
S_0. In c=1 critical systems (Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids), we find that S_0 is
a simple function of the boson compactification radius. This finding is based
on a field-theoretical analysis of the Dyson-Gaudin gas related to dimer and
Calogero-Sutherland models. We also performed numerical demonstrations in the
dimer models and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain. In a massive (crystal) phase, S_0 is
related to the ground-state degeneracy. We also examine this entropy in the
Ising chain in a transverse field as an example showing a c=1/2 critical point.

two-qubit Pauli group P2, respectively. It has been found [M. Socolovsky, Int.
J. Theor. Phys. 43, 1941 (2004)] that the CPT group of the Dirac equation is
isomorphic to P. One introduces a two-qubit entangling orthogonal matrix S
basically related to the CPT symmetry. With the aid of the two-qubit swap gate,
the S matrix allows the generation of the three-qubit real Clifford group and,
with the aid of the Toffoli gate, the Weyl group W(E8) is generated (M. Planat,
Preprint 0904.3691). In this paper, one derives three-qubit entangling groups ?
P and ? P2, isomorphic to the CPT group P and to the Dirac group P2, that are
embedded into W(E8). One discovers a new class of pure theequbit quantum states
with no-vanishing concurrence and three-tangle that we name CPT states. States
of the GHZ and CPT families, and also chain-type states, encode the new

transmission-line resonator. As already shown experimentally [Abdumalikov et
al. Phys. Rev. B 78, 180502 (2008)], the strong coupling regime of cavity QED
can readily be achieved by optimizing the local inductance of the resonator in
the vicinity of the qubit. In addition to yielding stronger coupling with
respect to other proposals for flux qubit based circuit QED, this approach
leads to a qubit-resonator coupling strength g which does not scale as the area
of the qubit but is proportional to the total inductance shared between the
resonator and the qubit. Strong coupling can thus be attained while still
minimizing sensitivity to flux noise. Finally, we show that by taking advantage
of the the large kinetic inductance of a Josephson junction in the center
conductor of the resonator can lead to coupling energies of several tens of
percent of the resonator frequency, reaching the ultrastrong coupling regime of
cavity QED where the rotating-wave approximation breaks down. This should allow

  MQ NMR dynamics is determined by the residual dipole-dipole interactions
which are not averaged completely due to the molecular diffusion in nanopores.
  Since the averaged non-secular Hamiltonian describing MQ NMR dynamics depends
on only one coupling constant, this Hamiltonian commutes with the square of the
total spin angular momentum $\hat I^2$.
  We use the basis of common eigenstates of $\hat I^2$ and the projection of

  This approach allows us to study MQ NMR dynamics in systems consisting of
several hundreds of spins. The analytical approximation of the stationary

  The analytical expressions for MQ NMR coherence intensities of the five-spin
system in a nanopore are found.
  Numerical investigations allow us to find the dependencies of intensities of
MQ coherences on their orders (the profiles of MQ coherences) in systems

  non-Abelian Vector Potential</title><description>  Tripod-scheme cold atoms interacting with laser beams have attracted
considerable interest for their role in synthesizing effective non-Abelian
vector potentials. Such effective vector potentials can be exploited to realize
an all-optical imprinting of geometric phases onto matter waves. By working on
carefully designed extensions of our previous work, we show that coherent
lattice structure of cold-atom sub-wavepackets can be formed and that the
non-Abelian Aharonov-Bohm effect can be easily manifested via the translational
motion of cold atoms. We also show that by changing the frame of reference,
effects due to a non-Abelian vector potential may be connected with a simple
dynamical phase effect, and that under certain conditions it can be understood
as an Abelian geometric phase in a different frame of reference. Results should
help design better schemes for the control of cold-atom matter waves.

permanent of a {0,1} matrix can be approximated in randomized polynomial time
by using a rapidly mixing Markov chain. A separate strand of the literature has
pursued the possibility of an alternate, purely algebraic, polynomial-time
approximation scheme. These schemes work by replacing each 1 with a random
element of an algebra A, and considering the determinant of the resulting
matrix. When A is noncommutative, this determinant can be defined in several
ways. We show that for estimators based on the conventional determinant, the
critical ratio of the second moment to the square of the first--and therefore
the number of trials we need to obtain a good estimate of the permanent--is (1
+ O(1/d))^n when A is the algebra of d by d matrices. These results can be
extended to group algebras, and semi-simple algebras in general. We also study
the symmetrized determinant of Barvinok, showing that the resulting estimator
has small variance when d is large enough. However, for constant d--the only
case in which an efficient algorithm is known--we show that the critical ratio
exceeds 2^{n} / n^{O(d)}. Thus our results do not provide a new polynomial-time
approximation scheme for the permanent. Indeed, they suggest that the algebraic
approach to approximating the permanent faces significant obstacles.
  We obtain these results using diagrammatic techniques in which we express
matrix products as contractions of tensor products. When these matrices are
random, in either the Haar measure or the Gaussian measure, we can evaluate the
trace of these products in terms of the cycle structure of a suitably random
permutation. In the symmetrized case, our estimates are then derived by a
connection with the character theory of the symmetric group.

compass model in a transverse magnetic field is studied in this paper. An exact
solution is obtained by using an extended Jordan and Wigner transformation to
the pseudo-spin operators. The fidelity susceptibility, the concurrence, the
block-block entanglement entropy, and the pseudo-spin correlation functions are
calculated with antiperiodic boundary conditions. The QPT driven by the
transverse field only emerges at zero field and is of the second-order. Several
critical exponents obtained by finite size scaling analysis are the same as
those in the 1D transverse field Ising model, suggesting the same universality
class. A logarithmic divergence of the entanglement entropy of a block at the
quantum critical point is also observed. From the calculated coefficient
connected to the central charge of the conformal field theory, it is suggested
that the block entanglement depends crucially on the detailed topological
structure of a system.

exact reason of this has not been pinpointed until now. Our explanation is that
quantum algorithms know in advance 50% of the solution of the problem they will
find in the future. In fact they can be represented as the sum of all the
possible histories of a respective &quot;advanced information classical algorithm&quot;.
This algorithm, given the advanced information (50% of the bits encoding the
problem solution), performs the operations (oracle's queries) still required to
identify the solution. Each history corresponds to a possible way of getting
the advanced information and a possible result of computing the missing
information. This explanation of the quantum speed up has an immediate
practical consequence: the speed up comes from comparing two classical
algorithms, with and without advanced information, with no physics involved.
This simplification could open the way to a systematic exploration of the
possibilities of speed up.

the population photoassociated in bound levels of the excited state; iii) the

imagined outcomes of a special counterfactual reference measurement. This
interpretation is seen particularly clearly by representing quantum states in
terms of probabilities for the outcomes of a fixed, fiducial symmetric
informationally complete (SIC) measurement. We further explore the extent to

  bath</title><description>  In the framework of nuclear magnetic resonance, we consider the general
problem of the coherent control of a spin coupled to a bath by means of
composite or continuous pulses of duration $\tau_\mathrm{p}$. We show explicity
that it is possible to design the pulse in order to achieve a decoupling of the
spin from the bath up to the third order in $\tau_\mathrm{p}$. The evolution of
the system is separated in the evolution of the spin under the action of the
pulse and of the bath times correction terms. We derive the correction terms
for a general time dependent axis of rotation and for a general coupling
between the spin and the environment. The resulting corrections can be made
vanish by an appropriate design of the pulse. For $\pi$ and $\pi/2$ pulses, we
demonstrate explicitly that pulses exist which annihilate the first and the
second order corrections even if the bath is fully quantum mechanical, i.e., it
displays internal dynamics. Such pulses will also be useful for quantum
information processing.

  resonator arrays</title><description>  We show that coherent control of the steady-state long-distance entanglement
between pairs of cavity-atom systems in an array of lossy and driven coupled
resonators is possible. The cavities are doped with atoms and are connected
through wave guides, other cavities or fibers depending on the implementation.
We find that the steady-state entanglement can be coherently controlled through
the tuning of the phase difference between the driving fields. It can also be
surprisingly high in spite of the pumps being classical fields. For some
implementations where the connecting element can be a fiber, long-distance
steady state quantum correlations can be established. Furthermore, the maximal
of entanglement for any pair is achieved when their corresponding direct
coupling is much smaller than their individual couplings to the third party.
This effect is reminiscent of the establishment of coherence between otherwise
uncoupled atomic levels using classical coherent fields. We suggest a method to
measure this entanglement by analyzing the correlations of the emitted photons
from the array and also analyze the above results for a range of values of the
system parameters, different network geometries and possible implementation
technologies.

bits (qubits) for proposed quantum computers, as the spin degrees of freedom
are relatively isolated from their surroundings, and can be coherently
manipulated e.g. through pulsed EPR and NMR. For solid state spin systems,
impurities in crystals based on carbon and silicon in various forms have been
suggested as qubits, and very long relaxation rates have been observed in such
systems. We have investigated a variety of these systems at high magnetic
fields in our multi-frequency pulsed EPR/ENDOR spectrometer. A high magnetic
field leads to large electron spin polarizations at helium temperatures giving
rise to various phenomena that are of interest with respect to quantum
computing. For example, it allows the initialization of the both the electron
spin as well as hyperfine-coupled nuclear spins in a well defined state by
combining millimeter and RF radiation; it can increase the T2 relaxation times
by eliminating decoherence due to dipolar interaction; and it can lead to new
mechanisms for the coherent electrical readout of electron spins. We will show
some examples of these and other effects in Si:P, SiC:N, and nitrogen-related
centers in diamond.

quantum-like representation algorithm (QLRA) was recently proposed by A.
Khrennikov [1]--[5]. Formally QLRA depends on the order of conditioning. For
two observables $a$ and $b,$ $b| a$- and $a | b$ conditional probabilities

One can instead regard decompositions as part of the theory, and ask what

self-consistent decompositions that specify a measurement context (i.e. von
Neumann decompositions) must represent apparatus as containing internal

Furthermore, the wavefunctions of the extended potentials are constructed. In

with this non-equilibrium situation manifests itself in oscillating,
standing-wave components of the potential. While the respective potential wells
are normally too shallow to be useful, they may be amplified by a highly

molecular transition frequency. We find that with an ideal choice of molecule

to boost the potential by up to two orders of magnitude. We analytically derive
the scaling of the potential depth as a function of reflectivity and analyze
how it varies with temperature and molecular properties. It is also shown how
the potential depth decreases for standing waves with a larger number of nodes.
Finally, we investigate the lifetime of the molecular ground state in a thermal

evaluated numerically, in a three-dimensional rectangular resonant cavity
bisected by a semiconductor diaphragm (SD), which is irradiated by a pulsed
laser with frequency of GHz order. The aim of this paper is to determine some
of the optimum conditions required to detect DCE photons relevant to a novel
experimental detection system. We expand upon the thin plasma sheet model
[Crocce et al., Phys. Rev. A 70 033811 (2004)] to estimate the number of
photons for both TE and TM modes at any given SD position. Numerical
calculations are performed considering up to 51 inter-mode couplings by varying
the SD location, driving period and laser power without any perturbations. It
is found that the number of photons created for TE modes strongly depends on SD
position, where the strongest enhancement occurs at the midpoint (not near the
cavity wall); while TM modes have weak dependence on SD position. Another
important finding is the fact that significant photon production for TM$_{111}$
modes still takes place at the midpoint even for a low laser power of 0.01
micro J/pulse, although the number of TE$_{111}$ photons decreases almost
proportionately with laser power. We also find a relatively wide tuning range
for both TE and TM modes that is correlated with the frequency variation of the
instantaneous mode functions caused by the interaction between the cavity
photons and conduction electrons in the SD excited by a pulsed laser.

we exhibit a class of quantum channel with vanishing zero-error classical

qubits, where 2d is the dimension of input state space. Third we further
construct quantum channels with vanishing zero-error classical capacity when

the zero-error quantum and classical capacities of quantum channels satisfy a
strong super-additivity beyond any classical channels, but also highlight the

coherent orthoalgebra which has only a finite number of elements, but at the
same time does not admit a bivaluation (i.e. a morphism with a codomain being
an orthoalgebra with just two elements). This problem is important in the
perspective of Bell-Kochen-Specker theory, since one can associate such an
orthoalgebra to every saturated non-colorable finite configuration of
projective lines. The first result obtained in this paper provides a general
method for constructing finite orthoalgebras. This method is then applied to
obtain a new infinite family of finite coherent orthoalgebras that do not admit
bivaluations. The corresponding proof is combinatorial and yields a description
of the groups of symmetries for these orthoalgebras.

considering the coupling of two particles that interact through a

  Rates for Quantum Cryptography</title><description>  The present thesis deals with various methods of quantum error correction. It
is divided into two parts. In the first part, dynamical decoupling methods are
considered which have the task of suppressing the influence of residual
imperfections in a quantum memory. The suppression is achieved by altering the
dynamics of an imperfect quantum memory with the help of a sequence of local
unitary operations applied to the qudits. Whereas up to now the operations of
such decoupling sequences have been constructed in a deterministic fashion,
strategies are developed in this thesis which construct the operations by
random selection from a suitable set. Furthermore, it is investigated if and
how the discussed decoupling strategies can be employed to protect a quantum
computation running on the quantum memory.
  The second part of the thesis deals with quantum error-correcting codes and
protocols for quantum key distribution. The focus is on the BB84 and the
6-state protocol making use of only one-way communication during the error
correction and privacy amplification steps. It is shown that by adding
additional errors to the preliminary key (a process called noisy preprocessing)
followed by the use of a structured block code, higher secure key rates may be
obtained. For the BB84 protocol it is shown that iterating the combined
preprocessing leads to an even higher gain.

quantum channels, neither of which individually have any zero-error capacity
whatsoever (even if arbitrarily many uses of the channels are available), but
such that access to even a single copy of both channels allows classical

  Nanophotonics</title><description>  In a large-scale quantum computer, the cost of communications will dominate
the performance and resource requirements, place many severe demands on the
technology, and constrain the architecture. Unfortunately, fault-tolerant
computers based entirely on photons with probabilistic gates, though equipped
with &quot;built-in&quot; communication, have very large resource overheads; likewise,
computers with reliable probabilistic gates between photons or quantum memories
may lack sufficient communication resources in the presence of realistic
optical losses. Here, we consider a compromise architecture, in which
semiconductor spin qubits are coupled by bright laser pulses through
nanophotonic waveguides and cavities using a combination of frequent
probabilistic and sparse determinstic entanglement mechanisms. The large
photonic resource requirements incurred by the use of probabilistic gates for
quantum communication are mitigated in part by the potential high-speed
operation of the semiconductor nanophotonic hardware. The system employs
topological cluster-state quantum error correction for achieving
fault-tolerance. Our results suggest that such an architecture/technology
combination has the potential to scale to a system capable of attacking
classically intractable computational problems.

loss. Straightforward amplification as in classical telecommunications is not
an option in quantum communication because of the no-cloning theorem. This
problem could be overcome by implementing quantum repeater protocols, which
create long-distance entanglement from shorter-distance entanglement via
entanglement swapping. Such protocols require the capacity to create
entanglement in a heralded fashion, to store it in quantum memories, and to
swap it. One attractive general strategy for realizing quantum repeaters is
based on the use of atomic ensembles as quantum memories, in combination with
linear optical techniques and photon counting to perform all required
operations. Here we review the theoretical and experimental status quo of this
very active field. We compare the potential of different approaches
quantitatively, with a focus on the most immediate goal of outperforming the

wall inserted at the centre of a harmonic oscillator system. We put an equal

under finite temperatures. When the wall admits distinct boundary conditions on
the two sides, then a net force is induced on the wall. We study the
temperature behaviour of the induced force both analytically and numerically
under the combination of the Dirichlet and the Neumann conditions, and
determine its scaling property for two statistical cases of the particles:
fermions and bosons. We find that the force has a nonvanishing limit at zero
temperature T = 0 and exhibits scalings characteristic to the statistics of the
particles. We also see that for higher temperatures the force decreases
according to 1/sqrt{T}, in sharp contrast to the case of the infinite potential

a nontrivial partition wall can be realized, it may be used as a probe to
examine the profile of the potentials and the statistics of the particles

distributed quantum information processing schemes based on cavity quantum
electrodynamics. This can be achieved by active tuning a mediating atom-cavity
system. In particular, we consider the dynamic coupling between two coupled
cavities, each interacting with a two-level atom, realized by tuning one of the
atoms. One atom-field system can be controlled to become maximally and
minimally coupled with its counterpart, allowing high fidelity excitation
confinement, Q-switching and reversible state transport. As an application, we
first show that simple tuning can lead to emission of near-Gaussian
single-photon pulses that is significantly different from the usual exponential
decay in a passive cavity-based system. The influences of cavity loss and
atomic spontaneous emission are studied in detailed numerical simulations,
showing the practicality of these schemes within the reach of current
experimental technology in solid-state environment. We then show that when the
technique is employed to an extended coupled-cavity scheme involving a

Universe is represented as a three brane, propagating in a bulk space time
punctured by D0-brane (D-particle) defects. As the D3-brane world moves in the
bulk, the D-particles cross it, and from an effective observer on D3 the
situation looks like a ``space-time foam'' with the defects ``flashing'' on and
off (``D-particle foam''). The open strings, with their ends attached on the
brane, which represent matter in this scenario, can interact with the
D-particles on the D3-brane universe in a topologically non-trivial manner,
involving splitting and capture of the strings by the D0-brane defects. Such
processes are described by logarithmic conformal field theories on the
world-sheet. Physically, they result in effective decoherence of the string
matter on the D3 brane, and as a result, of CPT Violation, but of a type that
implies an ill-defined nature of the effective CPT operator. Due to electric
charge conservation, only electrically neutral (string) matter can exhibit such
interactions with the D-particle foam. This may have unique, experimentally
detectable, consequences for electrically-neutral entangled quantum matter
states on the brane world, in particular the modification of the pertinent EPR
Correlation of neutral mesons in a meson factory.

localization properties of the KK modes. When no massless mode appears in the
spectrum, the correction to the Casimir energy is exponentially suppressed.
When a massless mode is present in the spectrum, the correction to the Casimir
energy can be, in principle, sizeable. Here we illustrate a new method to
compute the correction to the Casimir energy between two parallel plates,
localized on a brane. The Casimir energy is suppressed by two factors: at
lowest order in $\varepsilon$, the correction comes entirely from the massive

correction in $\varepsilon$ follows, instead, a power-law suppression due to
the small wave function overlap of the zero-mode with matter confined on the

electromagnetically-induced coupling between the levels. We show that by
appropriately shifting the triangular lattice potentials, experienced by atoms
in different levels, the Kagome lattice can be realized using only two standing
waves, generating a highly frustrated quantum system for the atoms.

As opposed to previous implementations of measurement-based squeezers, the

Moreover, we can observe sub-shot-noise quadrature variances in the output

mechanics (BM) is introduced to study a multiphoton process of atoms
interacting with the intense laser field: above-threshold ionization (ATI).
Quantum trajectory of an atomic electron in intense laser field is obtained
from the Bohm-Newton equation first and then the energy of the photoelectron is
gained from its trajectory. With energies of an ensemble of photoelectrons, we
obtain the ATI spectrum which is consistent with the previous theoretical and
experimental results. Comparing BM with the classical trajectory Monte-Carlo
method, we conclude that quantum potential may play a key role to reproduce the

resulting dynamics reduces the fidelity of the computation. We show that it is
possible to describe the loss in fidelity by a single quantum operation on the

achieve this simple description, we choose a particular form of spin-boson

keeping the system cool enough that the resource state remains close to the

interfere with the dynamics of the computation. For a sufficiently low

vibrating end-mirror of an optical cavity, by resonant coupling of mirror
vibrations to a narrow internal optical transition of an ensemble of two level
systems. The particles represented by a collective mesoscopic spin model
implement, together with the cavity, an efficient, frequency tailorable zero
temperature loss channel which can be turned to a gain channel of pump. As
opposed to the case of resolved-sideband cavity cooling requiring a small
cavity linewidth, one can work here with low finesses and very small cavity
volumes to enhance the light mirror and light atom coupling. The tailored loss
and gain channels provide for efficient removal of vibrational quanta and
suppress reheating. In a simple physical picture of sideband cooling, the atoms
shape the cavity profile to enhance/inhibit scattering into higher/lower energy
sidebands. The method should be applicable to other cavity based cooling
schemes for atomic and molecular gases as for molecular ensembles coupled to
stripline cavities.

  We study the properties of its Veldkamp space enabling us to identify subsets

  Among the geometric hyperplanes one can find the set of self-dual operators

a class of hyperplanes gives rise to Mermin squares and other generalized

to the 27 Wootters self-dual operators is just the underlying geometry of the
E6(6) symmetric entropy formula describing black holes and strings in five

This is then applied to analysing quantum information processing. While quantum

$N$ of the lattice. Special emphasis is given to the model with $\Delta=1/2$
and $N$ odd, whose ground state, the so-called Razumov-Stroganov state, has a
peculiar structure and no finite-size corrections to the energy per site. We
find that such model corresponds to a special point on the $\Delta$-axis which
separates the region where adding spin-pairs increases the energy per site from
that where the longer the chain the lower the energy. Entanglement properties
do not hold surprises for $\Delta=1/2$ and $N$ odd. Finite-size corrections to
the energy per site non trivially vanish also in the ferromagnetic $\Delta\to
-1^+$ isotropic limit, which is consequently addressed; in this case, peculiar
features of some entanglement properties, due to the finite length of the chain

to the energy per site is related to a peculiar structure of the ground state,

details the optical lattice generated by the coherent superposition of three
coplanar running laser waves with respective angles $2\pi/3$. The corresponding
band structure displays Dirac cones located at the corners of the Brillouin
zone and close to half-filling this system is well described by massless Dirac
fermions. We characterize their properties by accurately deriving the
nearest-neighbor hopping parameter $t_0$ as a function of the optical lattice
parameters. Our semi-classical instanton method proves in excellent agreement
with an exact numerical diagonalization of the full Hamilton operator in the
tight-binding regime. We conclude that the temperature range needed to access
the Dirac fermions regime is within experimental reach. We also analyze
imperfections in the laser configuration as they lead to optical lattice
distortions which affect the Dirac fermions. We show that the Dirac cones do
survive up to some critical intensity or angle mismatches which are easily
controlled in actual experiments. In the tight-binding regime, we predict, and
numerically confirm, that these critical mismatches are inversely proportional
to the square-root of the optical potential strength. We also briefly discuss
the interesting possibility of fine-tuning the mass of the Dirac fermions by
controlling the laser phase in an optical lattice generated by the incoherent
superposition of three coplanar independent standing waves with respective

Euclidean approach</title><description>  Application of quantum principles to living cells requires a new
approximation of the full quantum mechanical description of intracellular
dynamics. We discuss what principal elements any such good approximation should
contain. As one such element, the notion of &quot;Catalytic force&quot; Cf is introduced.
Cf is the effect of the molecular target of catalysis on the catalytic
microenvironment that adjusts the microenvironment towards a state that
facilitates the catalytic act. This phenomenon is experimentally testable and
has an intriguing implication for biological organization and evolution, as it
amounts to &quot;optimization without natural selection of replicators&quot;. Unlike the
statistical-mechanical approaches to self-organization, the Cf principle does
not encounter the problem of &quot;tradeoff between stability and complexity&quot; at the
level of individual cell. Physically, the Cf is considered as a harmonic-like
force of reaction, which keeps the state of the cell close to the ground state,
defined here as a state where enzymatic acts work most efficiently. Ground
state is subject to unitary evolution, and serves as a starting point in a
general strategy of quantum description of intracellular processes, termed here
&quot;Euclidean approach&quot;. The next step of this strategy is transition from the
description of ground state to that one of growing state, and we suggest how it
can be accomplished using arguments from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem.
Finally, given that the most reliable and informative observable of an
individual cell is the sequence of its genome, we propose that the
non-classical correlations between individual molecular events at the single
cell level could be easiest to detect using high throughput DNA sequencing.

  truncations</title><description>  In the context of the Oppenheim-Horodecki paradigm of nonclassical
correlation, a bipartite quantum state is (properly) classically correlated if
and only if it is represented by a density matrix having a product eigenbasis.
On the basis of this paradigm, we propose a measure of nonclassical correlation
by using truncations of a density matrix down to individual eigenspaces. It is
computable within polynomial time in the dimension of the Hilbert space albeit
imperfect in the detection range. This is in contrast to the measures
conventionally used for the paradigm. The computational complexity and
mathematical properties of the proposed measure are investigated in detail and
the physical picture of its definition is discussed.

  and observational consequences</title><description>  Starting from a generic generally covariant classical theory we introduce the
logarithmic correction to the quantum wave equation. We demonstrate the
emergence of the evolution time from the group of automorphisms of the von
Neumann algebra governed by this non-linear correction. It turns out that such
time parametrization is essentially energy-dependent and becomes global only
asymptotically - when the energies get very small comparing to the effective
quantum gravity scale. Similar thing happens to the Lorentz invariance - in the
resulting theory it becomes an asymptotic low-energy phenomenon. We show how
the logarithmic non-linearity deforms the vacuum wave dispersion relations and
explains certain features of the astrophysical data coming from recent
observations of high-energy cosmic rays. In general, the estimates imply that
ceteris paribus the particles with higher energy propagate slower than those
with lower one, therefore, for a high-energy particle the mean free path,
lifetime in a high-energy state and, therefore, travel distance from the source
can be significantly larger than one would expect from the conventional theory.
Apart from this, we discuss also the possibility and conditions of the
transluminal phenomena in the physical vacuum such as the Cherenkov-type shock
waves.

Lindblad equation as a generalization of complex WKB theory. Linear coupling to
the environment is assumed, but the Hamiltonian can be a general function of
positions and momenta. The theory is carried out in the chord representation
and describes the evolved quantum characteristic function, which gives direct
access to the Wigner function and the position representation of the density
operator by Fourier transforms. The propagation is shown to be of Liouville
type in a complex double phase space, the imaginary part of the action being
responsible for decoherence. The theory is exact in the quadratic case, just as
the real WKB theory that we previously developed for the Markovian evolution of
extended states, but it also describes the decoherent and dissipative evolution
of localized states, such as the interference terms of a Schr\&quot;odinger cat
state. The present rederivation of the real WKB approximation leads to its
interpretation as a first order classical perturbation of the complex theory
and to a discussion of its validity. The example of a simple cubic Hamiltonian
illustrates the various levels of approximation derived from the complex WKB
theory.

the instantaneous eigenstate of the hamiltonian. Unfortunately, existing
results, such as the quantum adiabatic theorem based on a slow down evolution

by the hamiltonian H(t) itself. Here we derive general criteria and exact
bounds, for the state and its phase, ensuring an adiabatic evolution for any
hamiltonian H(t). As a corollary we demonstrate that the commonly used
condition of a slow hamiltonian variation rate, compared to the spectral gap,
is indeed sufficient to ensure adiabaticity but only when the hamiltonian is
real and non oscillating (for instance containing exponential or polynomial but
no sinusoidal functions).

Our off-chip algorithm treats multiple photon-arrivals at pixel-array pairs, in

such a way that a correctly normalized g2 function is guaranteed. The impact of
detector background correlations between SPAD pixels and afterpulsing effects

the difficulty of NP-complete problems was due to the wide variation of the

showing that distinguishing between instances having zero or one witnesses is
as hard as recognizing NP, under randomized reductions. We consider the same
question in the quantum setting and investigate the possibility of reducing
quantum witnesses in the context of the complexity class QMA, the quantum
analogue of NP. The natural way to quantify the number of quantum witnesses is
the dimension of the witness subspace W in some appropriate Hilbert space H. We
present an efficient deterministic procedure that reduces any problem where the
dimension d of W is bounded by a polynomial to a problem with a unique quantum
witness. The main idea of our reduction is to consider the Alternating subspace
of the d-th tensor power of H. Indeed, the intersection of this subspace with
the d-th tensor power of W is one-dimensional, and therefore can play the role
of the unique quantum witness.

essential to the realization of a number of fundamental objectives, such as
quantum control and quantum information processing. Prior work has explored the
optimal control problem of generating such unitary transformations as a surface
optimization problem over the quantum control landscape, defined as a metric
for realizing a desired unitary transformation as a function of the control
variables. It was found that under the assumption of non-dissipative and
controllable dynamics, the landscape topology is trap-free, implying that any
reasonable optimization heuristic should be able to identify globally optimal
solutions. The present work is a control landscape analysis incorporating
specific constraints in the Hamiltonian corresponding to certain dynamical
symmetries in the underlying physical system. It is found that the presence of
such symmetries does not destroy the trap-free topology. These findings expand
the class of quantum dynamical systems on which control problems are
intrinsically amenable to solution by optimal control.

in focussing both experimental and theoretical research in quantum information
processing. These criteria were formulated specifically for the circuit model
of quantum computing. However, several new models for quantum computing
(paradigms) have been proposed that do not seem to fit the criteria well. The
question is therefore what are the general criteria for implementing quantum
computers. To this end, a formal operational definition of a quantum computer
is introduced. It is then shown that according to this definition a device is a
quantum computer if it obeys the following four criteria: Any quantum computer
must (1) have a quantum memory; (2) facilitate a controlled quantum evolution
of the quantum memory; (3) include a method for cooling the quantum memory; and
(4) provide a readout mechanism for subsets of the quantum memory. The criteria
are met when the device is scalable and operates fault-tolerantly. We discuss
various existing quantum computing paradigms, and how they fit within this

transverse degrees of freedom with the which-path states of a Sagnac
interferometer, it is possible to realize an optical amplifier for polarization
independent deflections. The theory for the interferometric weak value
amplification method is presented along with the experimental results, which
are in good agreement. Of particular interest, we measured the angular
deflection of a mirror down to 560 femtoradians and the linear travel of a
piezo actuator down to 20 femtometers.

Demonstrations so far have been based on picosecond pulsed lasers. Here, we
present the first investigation of photon pair generation in silicon waveguides
in a continuous regime. The source is characterized by coincidence
measurements. We uncover the presence of unexpected noise which had not been
noticed in earlier experiments. Subsequently, we present advances towards
integration of the photon pair source with other components on the chip. This
is demonstrated by photon pair generation in a Sagnac loop interferometer and
inside a micro-ring cavity. Comparison with the straight waveguide shows that
these are promising avenues for improving the source. In particular photon pair
generation in the micro-ring cavity yields a source with a spectral width of
approximately 150 pm resulting in a spectral brightness increased by more than
2 orders of magnitude.

discuss entanglement and other quantum correlations in the field of quantum

them. Apart from being so named because their density matrix looks like the
letter X, there is not as yet any characterization of them. The su(2) X su(2) X
u(1) subalgebra of the full su(4) algebra of two qubits is pointed out as the
underlying invariance of this class of states. X-states are a seven-parameter
family associated with this subalgebra of seven operators. This recognition
provides a route to preparing such states and also a convenient algebraic
procedure for analytically calculating their properties. At the same time, it
points to other groups of seven-parameter states that, while not at first sight
appearing similar, are also invariant under the same subalgebra. And it opens
the way to analyzing invariant states of other subalgebras in bipartite

observable, represented by a commutative special dagger Frobenius algebra,
gives rise to an abelian group of phase shifts, which we call the phase group.
We also identify a strong form of complementarity, satisfied by the Z and X

Hawking radiation as tunneling. We compute the amount of information encoded in
correlations among Hawking radiations for a variety of black holes, including
the Schwarzchild black hole, the Reissner-Nordstr\&quot;{o}m black hole, the Kerr
black hole, and the Kerr-Newman black hole. The special case of tunneling
through a quantum horizon is also considered. Within a phenomenological
treatment based on the accepted emission probability spectrum from a black
hole, we find that information is leaked out hidden in the correlations of
Hawking radiation. The recovery of this previously unaccounted for information
helps to conserve the total entropy of a system composed of a black hole plus
its radiations. We thus conclude, irrespective of the microscopic picture for
black hole collapsing, the associated radiation process: Hawking radiation as
tunneling, is consistent with unitarity as required by quantum mechanics.

general occurrence probabilities. The optimal measurements are classified into
three types. One of the three types of measurement is optimal depending on

For discrimination of two mixed states, an upper bound of the optimal success

system describes an isolated subsystem of a classical statistical ensemble with
infinitely many classical states. The state of this subsystem can be
characterized by only a few probabilistic observables. Their expectation values
define a density matrix if they obey a &quot;purity constraint&quot;. Then all the usual
laws of quantum mechanics follow, including Heisenberg's uncertainty relation,
entanglement and a violation of Bell's inequalities. No concepts beyond
classical statistics are needed for quantum physics - the differences are only
apparent and result from the particularities of those classical statistical
systems which admit a quantum mechanical description. Born's rule for quantum
mechanical probabilities follows from the probability concept for a classical
statistical ensemble. In particular, we show how the non-commuting properties
of quantum operators are associated to the use of conditional probabilities
within the classical system, and how a unitary time evolution reflects the
isolation of the subsystem. As an illustration, we discuss a classical
statistical implementation of a quantum computer.

point-particle case ($z$ is the coordinate normal to the plate). The result for

concurrence by Mintert--Buchleitner [F. Mintert and A. Buchleitner, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 98, 140505 (2007)]. Relating it to the reduction criterion for
separability we provide yet another proof of the bound and point out some
possibilities following from the proof which could lead to improvement of the
bound. Then, relating concurrence to the generalized robustness of
entanglement, we provide a method allowing for construction of lower bounds on
concurrence from any positive map (not only the reduction one). All these
quantities can be measured as mean values of some two--copy observables. In
this sense the method generalizes the Mintert--Buchleitner bound and recovers
it when the reduction map is used. As a particular case we investigate the
bound obtained from the transposition map. Interestingly, comparison with MB
bound performed on the class of 4\otimes 4 rotationally invariant states shows
that the new bound is positive in regions in which the MB bound gives zero.
Finally, we provide measurable upper bounds on the whole class of concurrences.

model that directly imitates discrete quantum systems. Qubits are represented
as harmonic functions in a 2D vector space. Multiplication of qubit
representations of different frequencies results in exponential growth of the
state space similar to the tensor-product composition of qubit spaces in
quantum mechanics. Individual qubits remain accessible in a composite system,
which is represented as a complex function of a single variable, though
entanglement imposes a demand on resources that scales exponentially with the
number of entangled qubits. We carry out a simulation of Shor's algorithm and
discuss a simpler implementation in this classical model.

for a probe pulse propagating through a chiral medium, and solve them
analytically in Fourier space using the slowly varying envelope approximation.
Our analysis reveals the influence of the different medium response
coefficients on the propagation dynamics. Applying these results to a specific
example system, we show that chiral interactions already become important at
experimentally accessible parameter ranges in dilute vapors. The chirality
renders the propagation dynamics sensitive to the phase of the applied fields,
and we show that this phase-dependence enables one to control the pulse
evolution during its propagation through the medium. Our results demonstrate
that the magnetic field component of a probe beam can crucially influence the
system dynamics even if it couples to the medium only weakly.

computer several groups have started to develop miniaturized ion traps for
extended spatial control and manipulation of the ions. Shuttling and separation
of ion strings have been the foremost issues in linear-trap arrangements and
some prototypes of junctions have been demonstrated for the extension of ion
motion to two dimensions (2D). While junctions require complex trap structures,
small extensions to the 1D motion can be accomplished in simple linear trap
arrangements. Here, control of the extended field in a planar, linear chip trap
is used to shuttle ions in 2D. With this approach, the order of ions in a
string is deterministically reversed. Optimized potentials are theoretically
derived and simulations show that the reordering can be carried out
adiabatically. The control over individual ion positions in a linear trap
presents a new tool for ion-trap quantum computing. The method is also expected
to work with mixed crystals of different ion species and as such could have
applications for sympathetic cooling of an ion string.

construct asymmetric quantum error controlling codes to protect quantum
information over asymmetric channels, $\Pr Z \geq \Pr X$. In this paper we
present two generic methods to derive asymmetric quantum cyclic codes using the

Consequently, the methods allow us to construct several families of asymmetric
quantum BCH, RS, and RM codes. Finally, the methods are used to construct

the efficient implementation of our method for geometries of practical interest
and extend our previous proof-of-concept algorithm in one dimension to problems
in two and three dimensions, introducing a number of new optimizations. We
consider Casimir piston-like problems with nonmonotonic and monotonic force
dependence on sidewall separation, both for previously solved geometries to

and/or cylindrical pistons. We include realistic dielectric materials to
calculate the force between suspended silicon waveguides or on a suspended

absorbing boundaries and/or periodic boundaries. In addition we apply this
method to a realizable three-dimensional system in which a silica sphere is
stably suspended in a fluid above an indented metallic substrate. More
generally, the method allows off-the-shelf FDTD software, already supporting a
wide variety of materials (including dielectric, magnetic, and even anisotropic
materials) and boundary conditions, to be exploited for the Casimir problem.

that the space which confines it must be quantized. This suggests that space
itself is discrete, and that all measurable lengths are quantized in units of a
fundamental length (which can be the Planck length). On the one hand, this
signals the breakdown of the spacetime continuum picture near that scale, and
on the other hand, it can predict an upper bound on the quantum gravity
parameter in the GUP, from current observations. Furthermore, such fundamental
discreteness of space may have observable consequences at length scales much
larger than the Planck scale.

possible variance in ways that are readily implementable with current
experimental techniques. Measurements whose statistics have high-frequency
fringes, such as those obtained from NOON states, have commensurately high
information yield. However this information is also highly ambiguous because it
does not distinguish between phases at the same point on different fringes. We
provide schemes to eliminate this phase ambiguity in a highly efficient way,
providing phase estimates with uncertainty that is within a small constant
factor of the Heisenberg limit, the minimum allowed by the laws of quantum
mechanics. These techniques apply to NOON state and multi-pass interferometry,
as well as phase measurements in quantum computing. We have reported the
experimental implementation of some of these schemes with multi-pass
interferometry elsewhere. Here we present the theoretical foundation, and also
present some new experimental results. There are three key innovations to the
theory in this paper. First, we examine the intrinsic phase properties of the
sequence of states (in multiple time modes) via the equivalent two-mode state.
Second, we identify the key feature of the equivalent state that enables the
optimal scaling of the intrinsic phase uncertainty to be obtained. This enables
us to identify appropriate combinations of states to use. The remaining
difficulty is that the ideal phase measurements to achieve this intrinic phase
uncertainty are often not physically realizable. The third innovation is to
solve this problem by using realizable measurements that closely approximate
the optimal measurements, enabling the optimal scaling to be preserved.

Gudder's ``intrinsic metric'' by means of the optimal success probability,
which turns out to be a generalization of the trace distance for quantum

between a classical linear code and an entanglement-assisted quantum
error-correcting code (EAQECC), the issue of maintaining large amount of pure
maximally entangled states in constructing EAQECCs is a practical obstacle to
its use. It is also conjectured that the power of entanglement-assisted
formalism to convert those good classical codes comes from massive consumption
of maximally entangled states. We show that the above conjecture is wrong by
providing families of EAQECCs with an entanglement consumption rate that
diminishes linearly as a function of the code length. Notably, two families of
EAQECCs constructed in the paper require only one copy of maximally entangled
state no matter how large the code length is. These families of EAQECCs that
are constructed from classical finite geometric LDPC codes perform very well
according to our numerical simulations. Our work indicates that EAQECCs are not

these high performance entanglement-assisted LDPC codes with low entanglement

theorem (QET) of 1929, a strong result arising from the mere mathematical
structure of quantum mechanics. The QET is a precise formulation of what we
call normal typicality, i.e., the statement that, for typical large systems,
every initial wave function $\psi_0$ from an energy shell is &quot;normal&quot;: it
evolves in such a way that $|\psi_t&gt; &lt;\psi_t|$ is, for most $t$,
macroscopically equivalent to the micro-canonical density matrix. The QET has
been mostly forgotten after it was criticized as a dynamically vacuous
statement in several papers in the 1950s. However, we point out that this
criticism does not apply to the actual QET, a correct statement of which does
not appear in these papers, but to a different (indeed weaker) statement.
Furthermore, we formulate a stronger statement of normal typicality, based on

  vapour</title><description>  We analyse a novel squeezing and entangling mechanism which is due to
correlated Stokes and anti-Stokes photon forward scattering in a multi-level
atom vapour. Following the proposal we present an experimental demonstration of
3.5 dB pulsed frequency nondegenerate squeezed (quadrature entangled) state of
light using room temperature caesium vapour. The source is very robust and
requires only a few milliwatts of laser power. The squeezed state is generated
in the same spatial mode as the local oscillator and in a single temporal mode.
The two entangled modes are separated by twice the Zeeman frequency of the
vapour which can be widely tuned. The narrow-band squeezed light generated near
an atomic resonance can be directly used for atom-based quantum information
protocols. Its single temporal mode characteristics make it a promising
resource for quantum information processing.

application still exist and the boundary between quantum and classical
mechanics remains unclear. Based on the philosophical assumptions of
macrorealism and noninvasive measurability, Leggett and Garg devised a series
of inequalities (LG inequalities) involving a single system with a set of
measurements at different times. Introduced as the Bell inequalities in time,
the violation of LG inequalities excludes the hidden-variable description based
on the above two assumptions. We experimentally investigated the single photon
LG inequalities under decoherence simulated by birefringent media. These
generalized LG inequalities test the evolution trajectory of the photon and are
shown to be maximally violated in a coherent evolution process. The violation
of LG inequalities becomes weaker with the increase of interaction time in the
environment. The ability to violate the LG inequalities can be used to set a
boundary of the classical realistic description.

discuss a novel approach to designing elementary QEC memory cells, in which all
control operations are performed autonomously by an embedded optical feedback

wave-guides. The photonic QEC circuit is entirely on-chip, requiring no
external clocking or control, and during steady-state operation would only need
to be powered by the injection of constant-amplitude coherent fields.

  Schroedinger paradox</title><description>  The main distinction between classical mechanics and quantum mechanics is the
lack in the latter of a full mechanical determinism: different final states can
arise from the same physical state, after the measurement. No hidden variable
is supposed to exist, nothing can discriminate two apparently identical states
even if they give a different result. In this paper we try to put the basis for
a more fundamental theory that (approximately) coincides with quantum mechanics
when comparing statistics, but it is more fundamental, since it mathematically
describes measurement processes giving an explicit time evolution of the wave
function during the collapse. The theory is deterministic even if the
Heisenberg uncertainty principle is still valid. The theory distinguishes
physical states that collapse and physical states that do not collapse. The
theory can be made compatible with all experiments done in the past, but new
phenomena such as violations of the Born law or the superposition principle
could transpire. However, even if we have probably shown that it is possible to
build ad hoc a theory that can describe both the wave function collapse and the
Schroedinger linear evolution, a simple and unified construction is still
missing.

far away from the range of energies where we may expect to observe non-quantum

In this paper, we clarify the extent of how &quot;classical&quot; a BEC is by exploring
the semiclassical equations for BECs under the mean field Gaussian

classical limit in terms of the variables &lt; x &gt; and &lt; p &gt; as well as their

semiclassical equations, and the equations to be solved are far less
computationally intensive than solving the GPE which make them ideal for

strong sense to an equilibrium state starting out from a generic pure state.
Nevertheless for large system size one observes temporal typicality. Namely,
for the overwhelming majority of the time instants, the statistics of
observables is practically indistinguishable from an effective equilibrium one.
In this paper we consider the Loschmidt echo (LE) to study this sort of unitary
equilibration after a quench. We draw several conclusions on general grounds
and on the basis of an exactly-solvable example of a quasi-free system. In
particular we focus on the whole probability distribution of observing a given
value of the LE after waiting a long time. Depending on the interplay between
the initial state and the quench Hamiltonian, we find different regimes
reflecting different equilibration dynamics. When the perturbation is small and
the system is away from criticality the probability distribution is Gaussian.
However close to criticality the distribution function approaches a double
peaked, &quot;batman-hood&quot; shaped, universal form.

Gravitational considerations teach us that black holes must trap everything

as featureless (Hawking) radiation. However, if Hawking's analysis turned out
to be accurate then the information would be irretrievably lost and a

likewise fail. Here we show that the information about the matter that
collapses to form a black hole becomes encoded into pure correlations within a
tripartite quantum system, the quantum analog of a one-time pad until very late

of a black hole is due to entropy of entanglement. In this view the black hole
entropy is primarily due to trans-event horizon entanglement between external

to deliver single photons of arbitrary temporal shape. Our model applies to
Raman transitions in three-level atoms with one branch of the transition driven
by a laser pulse, and the other coupled to a cavity mode. For any possible
shape of the single-photon wavepacket, we derive an unambiguous analytic
expression for the shape of the required driving laser pulse. We furthermore
discuss the constraints limiting the maximum probability for emitting any
desired photon, and use these to estimate upper bounds for the efficiency of

classical computer. The time required for solving the Schr\&quot;odinger equation to
obtain molecular energies has been demonstrated to scale polynomially with
system size on a quantum computer, in contrast to the well-known result of
exponential scaling on a classical computer. In this paper, we present a
quantum algorithm to obtain the energy spectrum of molecular systems based on
the multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) wave function. By using
a MCSCF wave function as the initial guess, the excited states are accessible;
Entire potential energy surfaces of molecules can be studied more efficiently
than if the simpler Hartree-Fock guess was employed. We show that a small
increase of the MCSCF space can dramatically increase the success probability
of the quantum algorithm, even in regions of the potential energy surface that
are far from the equilibrium geometry. For the treatment of larger systems, a
multi-reference configuration interaction approach is suggested. We demonstrate
that such an algorithm can be used to obtain the energy spectrum of the water
molecule.

has recently been proposed. Given two quantum channels A and B, a set of payoff
functions have been proven to have values for B at least as high as they are
for A if and only if there exists a quantum garbling channel E such that A=EB.
When such a channel E exists, we can globally compare A and B in terms of their
`noisiness'. We show that this method of channel noise comparison is equivalent
to one obtained by considering the degradation of the distinguishability of
states. Here, the channel A is said to be at least as noisy as the channel B if
any ensemble of states, fed into each channel and possibly entangled with
ancillae, emerges no more distinguishable from A than it does from channel B,
where distinguishability is quantified by the minimum error discrimination
probability. We also provide a novel application to eavesdropper detection in

The deviations from classical behavior of a macroscopic body, except for those
that can be described as classical uncertainties in the initial values of
macroscopic variables,are {\it exponentially} small as a function of the volume
of the macro-system in microscopic units. Conventional estimates are correct
only when the internal degrees of freedom of the macrosystem are in their
ground state, and the classical motion of collective coordinates is adiabatic.
Otherwise, the system acts as its own environment and washes out quantum phase
correlations between different classical states of its collective coordinates.
I suggest that it is likely that we can only achieve meso-scopic
superpositions, for systems which have topological variables, and for which we
can couple to those variables without exciting phonons.

nonlocality of bipartite finite-dimensional systems (bipartite qudits).
Entanglement is one of the most fascinating non-classical features of quantum
theory, and besides its impact on our view of the world, it can be exploited
for applications such as quantum cryptography and quantum computing. (...)
Although entanglement and nonlocality are ordinarily regarded as one and the
same, under close consideration this cannot be taken for granted. The reason
for this is that entanglement is defined by the mathematical structure of a
quantum state in a composite Hilbert space, whereas nonlocality signifies that
the statistical behaviour of a system cannot be described by a local realistic
theory. For the latter it is essential that the correlation probabilities of
such theories obey so-called Bell inequalities, which are violated for certain
quantum states. The main focus of this thesis is on the comparison of both
properties with the objective of understanding their relation. (...) Because of
the fact that the correlation probabilities in general depend on the
measurement settings it is necessary to optimise these in order to reveal
nonlocality. This problem is solved for a particular Bell inequality (CGMLP) by
means of a self-developed numerical search algorithm. The method is then
applied to density matrices of a subspace spanned by the projectors of
maximally entangled two-qudit states. This set of states (...) serves to
visualise and analyse the state space geometrically.

efficient storage of cavity photons into long-lived atomic excitations, and
their retrieval with high fidelity. This process presumes an adiabatic transfer
through the `dark state', a coherent superposition of the two lower levels of
the $\Lambda$ system, by a slow variation of the intensity of the control

to examine the nonadiabatic effects, as the control laser is varied in time.
The nonadiabatic effects arise due to inevitable excitations of the system to

radiative. We formulate the problem in terms of the instantaneous eigenstates
and solve it numerically, allowing for spontaneous decays from the excited

which is perpendicular to a set of vectors, each of which lies in the Hilbert
space of k qubits. Equivalently, the problem is to decide whether a particular
type of local Hamiltonian has a ground state with zero energy. We consider
random quantum k-SAT formulas with n variables and m = \alpha n clauses, and
ask at what value of \alpha these formulas cease to be satisfiable. We show
that the threshold for random quantum 3-SAT is at most 3.594. For comparison,
convincing arguments from statistical physics suggest that the classical 3-SAT
threshold is \alpha \approx 4.267. For larger k, we show that the quantum
threshold is a constant factor smaller than the classical one. Our bounds work
by determining the generic rank of the satisfying subspace for certain gadgets,
and then using the technique of differential equations to analyze various
algorithms that partition the hypergraph into a collection of these gadgets.
Our use of differential equation to establish upper bounds on a satisfiability
threshold appears to be novel, and our techniques may apply to various
classical problems as well.

The spin bath is described by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and the bath spins
are subjected to a transverse magnetic field. We investigate the qubit
interacting via either an Ising- or an XY-type coupling term to subsets of bath
spins of differing size. The large degree of symmetry of the bath allows us to
find parameter regimes where the initial qubit state is revived at well defined
times after the qubit preparation. These times may become independent of the
bath size for large baths and thus enable faithful qubit storage even in the
presence of strong coupling to a bath. We analyze a large range of parameters
and identify those which are best suited for quantum memories. In general we
find that a small number of links between qubit and bath spins leads to less
decoherence and that systems with Ising coupling between qubit and bath spins
are preferable.

holes with contracting horizons is proposed. The method is based on a gedanken
experiment on quantum energy teleportation (QET), which has been recently
proposed in quantum information theory. We consider this QET protocol for N
massless fields in near-horizon regions of large-mass black holes with
near-horizon geometry described by the Minkowski metric. For each field, a
two-level spin is strongly coupled with the local quantum fluctuation outside
the horizon during a short time period. After the measurement of N fields,
N-bit information is obtained. During the measurement, positive-energy wave
packets of the fields form and then fall into the black hole. The amount of
excitation energy is independent of the measurement result. After absorption of
the wave packets and increase of the black hole mass, a
measurement-result-dependent local operation of the N fields is performed
outside the horizon. Then, accompanying the extraction of positive energy from
the quantum fluctuation by the operation, negative-energy wave packets of the
fields form and then fall into the black hole, decreasing the black hole mass.
This implies that a part of the absorbed positive energy emitted from the
measurement devices is effectively retrieved from the black hole via the
measurement results.

adjusting some parameters (increasing $b_{x}$ and $J$, decreasing $B_{x}$ and

studied. Because electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations are essential for
radiative decay of excited atomic states, decay rates can serve as a measure of
the suppression of vacuum fluctuation in non-classical states, such as squeezed
vacuum states. In such states the renormalized expectation value of the square
of the electric field or the energy density can be periodically negative,
representing suppression of vacuum fluctuations. We explore the extent to which
atomic decays can be used to measure the mean squared electric field or energy
density. We consider a scheme in which atoms in an excited state transit a
closed cavity whose lowest mode contains photons in a non-classical state. The
change in the decay probability of the atom in the cavity due to the
non-classical state can, under certain circumstances, serve as a measure of the
mean squared electric field or energy density in the cavity. We derive a
quantum inequality bound on the decrease in this probability. We also show that
the decrease in decay rate can sometimes be a measure of negative energy
density or negative squared electric field. We make some estimates of the
magnitude of this effect, which indicate that an experimental test might be

called entangled states. A physical system, that is in an entangled state
displays an intricate correlation between its subsystems. There are also some
composite quantum states (classically correlated states or separable states)
that are not entangled. It is generally claimed, often without a rigorous proof
to support, that these intricate correlations of an entangled state cannot
occur in a classical system. This expository article, provides an elementary
proof that entangled states cannot arise in the setting of classical mechanics.
In addition, a detailed description of the origin of entanglement in quantum
systems is included. The mathematical concepts that are necessary for this
purpose are presented. The absence of entanglement in the classical setting is
due to the fact that every pure classical state of a composite system is a
product state, that is, a tensor product of two pure states of the subsystems.
In contrast, there are pure composite quantum states that cannot be expressed
in the form of a product state or even by a convex sum of product states.
Roughly speaking, this is because classical states are positive valued
functions on the phase-space while quantum states are positive linear
operators. The structure of the tensor product between two commutative spaces
of scalar valued functions is drastically different from that of the tensor
product between two non-commutative spaces of linear operators. In other words,
entanglement is a non-commutative phenomenon.

utilization of this effect for getting faster signals is the exponential
damping by the tunnel, so there seems to be a trade-off between speedup and
intensity. In this paper we prove that this trade-off is never in favor of
faster signals: the probability for a signal to reach its destination before
some deadline is always reduced by the tunnel, for arbitrary incoming states,
arbitrary positive and compactly supported tunnel potentials, and arbitrary
detectors. More specifically, we show this for several different ways to define
``the same incoming state'' and ''the same detector'' when comparing the
settings with and without tunnel potential. The arrival time measurements are
expressed in the time-covariant approach, but we also allow the detection to be
a localization measurement at a later time.

  Environments</title><description>  We consider two separated oscillators initially in equilibrium and
continuously interacting with thermal environments, and propose a way to
entangle them using a mediating qubit. An appropriate interaction allows for an
analytic treatment of the open system, removes the necessity of fine-tuning
interaction times and results in a high tolerance of the entanglement to finite
temperature. The entanglement thus produced between the oscillators can be
verified either through a Bell inequality relying on oscillator parity
measurements or through conditional extraction of the entanglement on to two
mutually non-interacting qubits. The latter process also shows that the
generated mixed entangled state of the oscillators is an useful resource for
entangling qubits. By allowing for influences from environments, taking
feasible qubit-oscillator interactions and measurement settings, this scheme
should be implementable in a variety of experimental setups. The method
presented for the solution of the master equation can also be adapted to a
variety of problems involving the same form of qubit-oscillator interaction

Quantifying the purity of an experimentally achieved graph state could in

Rob. Under the single mode approximation (SMA) a fermion field only had a few
accessible levels due to Pauli exclusion principle, conversely to bosonic
fields which had an infinite number of excitable levels. This was argued to
justify entanglement survival in the fermionic case in the SMA infinite
acceleration limit. Here we relax SMA. Hence, an infinite number of modes are
excited as the observer Rob accelerates, even for a fermion field. We will
prove that, despite this analogy with the bosonic case, entanglement loss is
limited. We will show that this comes from fermionic statistics through the
characteristic structure it imposes on the infinite dimensional density matrix
for Rob. Surprisingly, the surviving entanglement is independent of the
specific maximally entangled state chosen, the kind of fermionic field
analyzed, and the number of accessible modes considered. We shall discuss
whether this surviving entanglement goes beyond the purely statistical

features of the maximum-entropy-production/steepest-entropy-ascent nonlinear
evolution equation proposed long ago by this author in the framework of a fully
quantum theory of irreversibility and thermodynamics for a single isolated or
adiabatic particle, qubit, or qudit, and recently rediscovered by other
authors. The nonlinear equation generates a dynamical group, not just a
semigroup, providing a deterministic description of irreversible conservative
relaxation towards equilibrium from any non-equilibrium density operator. It
satisfies a very restrictive stability requirement equivalent to the
Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the second law of thermodynamics. We then
examine the form of the evolution equation we proposed to describe multipartite
isolated or adiabatic systems. This hinges on novel nonlinear projections
defining local operators that we interpret as ``local perceptions'' of the
overall system's energy and entropy. Each component particle contributes an
independent local tendency along the direction of steepest increase of the
locally perceived entropy at constant locally perceived energy. It conserves
both the locally-perceived energies and the overall energy, and meets strong
separability and non-signaling conditions, even though the local evolutions are
not independent of existing correlations. We finally show how the geometrical
construction can readily lead to other thermodynamically relevant models, such
as of the nonunitary isoentropic evolution needed for full extraction of a

allow for the imaging of static (DC) and oscillatory (AC) nanoscopic magnetic
systems. However, these techniques require accurate knowledge and control of
the sample dynamics, and are thus limited in their ability to image fields
arising from rapidly fluctuating (FC) environments. We show here that FC fields
place restrictions on the DC field sensitivity of an NV qubit magnetometer, and
that by probing the dephasing rate of the qubit in a magnetic FC environment,
we are able to measure fluctuation rates and RMS field strengths that would be
otherwise inaccessible with the use of DC and AC magnetometry techniques. FC
sensitivities are shown to be comparable to those of AC fields, whilst
requiring no additional experimental overheads or control over the sample.

atomic coherences in an Erbium doped solid using external electric fields. This
is achieved by controlling the inhomogeneous broadening of Erbium ions emitting
at 1536 nm using an electric field gradient and the linear Stark effect. The
manipulation of atomic coherence is characterized with the collective
spontaneous emission (optical free induction decay) emitted by the sample after
an optical excitation, which does not require any previous preparation of the
atoms. We show that controlled dephasing and rephasing of the atoms by the

decay. Our results show that the use of external electric fields does not
introduce any substantial additional decoherence and enables the manipulation
of collective atomic coherence with a very high degree of precision on the time

hidden variables are not observables, so their distributions of probabilities
do not necessarily possess the non-signaling property. Also, a counter-example

identical harmonic oscillators interacting with a common environment. We treat
the problem very general by working with the Hamiltonian without the
rotating-wave approximation and by considering the environment as a
non-Markovian reservoir to the oscillators. We invoke an $N$-mode unitary
transformation of the position and momentum operators and find that in the
transformed basis the system is represented by a set of independent harmonic
oscillators with only one of them coupled to the environment. Working in the
Wigner representation of the density operator, we find that the covariance
matrix has a block diagonal form that it can be expressed in terms of multiples
of $3\times 3$ and $4\times 4$ matrices. This simple property allows to treat
the problem to some extend analytically. We illustrate the advantage of working
in the transformed basis on a simple example of three harmonic oscillators and
find that the entanglement can persists for long times due to presence of
constants of motion for the covariance matrix elements. We find that, in
contrast to what one could expect, a strong damping of the oscillators leads to
a better stationary entanglement than in the case of a weak damping.

such controls that are strongly Hamiltonian-dependent and investigate their

when the existence of a wave function for photons (properly defined) is
assumed. This formulation thus provides an alternative interpretation of
optical phenomena in terms of photon trajectories, whose flow yields a
pictorial view of the evolution of the electromagnetic energy density in
configuration space. This trajectory-based theoretical framework is considered
here to study and analyze the outcome from Young-type diffraction experiments

trajectories in the region behind the two slits are obtained in the case where
the slits are illuminated by a polarized monochromatic plane wave. Expressions

it by the presence (right behind each slit) of polarizers with the same or

generate a maximally entangled state from some unentangled input. We study the
following question: How many runs of a given two-qubit entangling unitary
operation is required to simulate some perfect entangler with one-qubit unitary
operations as free resources? We completely solve this problem by presenting an
analytical formula for the optimal number of runs of the entangling operation.
Our result reveals an entanglement strength of two-qubit unitary operations.

experiment, is that for any alternatives that cannot be distinguished by
measurement physical predictions are obtained by summation of their amplitudes.
In particle oscillation experiments, a particle's time of detection is not
directly measured, consequently, the detection probability should involve the
summation over amplitudes corresponding to different detection times. However,
in contrast to the principle above, standard treatments involve summation over
probabilities rather than amplitudes; this implicitly assumes the existence of
a decohering mechanism. In this work, we construct the detection probabilities
for particle oscillations by summation over amplitudes, corresponding to
different detection times. The resulting wavelength of particle oscillations
differs from the standard expression by a factor of two. Moreover, we predict a
dependence of the oscillation wavelength on the threshold of the decay process
used for detection.

idea of a signature of photon-counts, which may be used to more robustly
reconstruct the photon number distribution of a quantum state. The methodology
is applied experimentally in a 9-port loop detector operating at a
telecommunications wavelength and compared directly to the approach whereby
only the number of photon-counts is used to reconstruct the input distribution.
The signature approach is shown to be more robust against calibration errors,
exhibit reduced statistical uncertainty, and reduced reliance on a-priori

It has also been shown that the advantage in gate count obtained in some of the
earlier proposals by introduction of new reversible gates is an artifact and if
it is allowed then every circuit block can be reduced to a single gate.
Further, it is shown that the 4x4 reversible gates proposed for designing of a

many such 4x4 gates may be proposed. As example three such new gates have been

probability distribution. Furthermore, this metric can be expressed in terms of
derivatives of the free energy, indicating a relation to Ruppeiner geometry.
This allows us to obtain exact expressions for the (suitably rescaled) metric
in the thermodynamic limit. The phase transition of the isotropic LMG model is
signalled by a degeneracy of this (improper) metric in the paramagnetic phase.
Due to the integrability of the isotropic LMG model, ground state level

  of transferable bits per particle</title><description>  Quantum key distribution schemes which employ encoding on vacuum-one-photon
qubits are capable of transferring more information bits per particle than the
standard schemes employing polarization or phase coding. We calculate the
maximum number of classical bits per particle that can be securely transferred
when the key distribution is performed with the BB84 and B92 protocols,
respectively, using the vacuum-one-photon qubits. In particular, we show that
for a generalized B92 protocol with the vacuum-one-photon qubits, a maximum of
two bits per particle can be securely transferred. We also demonstrate the
advantage brought about by performing a generalized measurement that is
optimized for unambiguous discrimination of the encoded states: the parameter
range where the transfer of two bits per particle can be achieved is
dramatically enhanced as compared to the corresponding parameter range of
projective measurements.

systems, and the ultimate performance limit of amplifiers is set by quantum
physics. Increasing the amplitude of an unknown quantum optical field, or more
generally any harmonic oscillator state, must introduce noise. This linear
amplification noise prevents the perfect copying of the quantum state, enforces
quantum limits on communications and metrology, and is the physical mechanism
that prevents the increase of entanglement via local operations. It is known
that non-deterministic versions of ideal cloning and local entanglement
increase (distillation) are allowed, suggesting the possibility of
non-deterministic noiseless linear amplification. Here we introduce, and
experimentally demonstrate, such a noiseless linear amplifier for
continuous-variables states of the optical field, and use it to demonstrate
entanglement distillation of field-mode entanglement. This simple but powerful
circuit can form the basis of practical devices for enhancing quantum
technologies. The idea of noiseless amplification unifies approaches to cloning
and distillation, and will find applications in quantum metrology and
communications.

different and partially overlapping support. Further elements of fermionic
operator circuits (FOCs) are partial traces and partial projections. The
presented framework allows for the introduction of fermionic versions of known
qudit operator circuits (QUOC), important for the simulation of strongly
correlated d-dimensional systems: The multiscale entanglement renormalization
ansatz (MERA), tree tensor networks (TTN), projected entangled pair states
(PEPS), or their infinite-size versions (iPEPS etc.). After the definition of a
FOC, we present a method to contract it with the same computation and memory
requirements as a corresponding QUOC, for which all fermionic operators are
replaced by qudit operators of identical dimension. A given scheme for
contracting the QUOC relates to an analogous scheme for the corresponding
fermionic circuit, where additional marginal computational costs arise only
from reordering of modes for operators occurring in intermediate stages of the
contraction. Our result hence generalizes efficient schemes for the simulation
of d-dimensional spin systems, as MERA, TTN, or PEPS to the fermionic case.

realizes computing devices that make use of quantum mechanical principles, like
the superposition principle, entanglement, and interference. In this review we
study the information counterpart of computing. The abstract form of the
distributed computing setting is called communication complexity. It studies
the amount of information, in terms of bits or in our case qubits, that two
spatially separated computing devices need to exchange in order to perform some
computational task. Surprisingly, quantum mechanics can be used to obtain
dramatic advantages for such tasks.
  We review the area of quantum communication complexity, and show how it
connects the foundational physics questions regarding non-locality with those
of communication complexity studied in theoretical computer science. The first
examples exhibiting the advantage of the use of qubits in distributed
information-processing tasks were based on non-locality tests. However, by now
the field has produced strong and interesting quantum protocols and algorithms
of its own that demonstrate that entanglement, although it cannot be used to
replace communication, can be used to reduce the communication exponentially.
In turn, these new advances yield a new outlook on the foundations of physics,
and could even yield new proposals for experiments that test the foundations of
physics.

that they are all equivalent to the axiomatic definition. Next, we describe a
simple n-dimensional QCA capable of simulating all others, in that the initial

within the initial configuration of the intrinsically universal QCA, and that
several steps of the intrinsically universal QCA then correspond to one step of

n-dimensional intrinsic simulation, i.e. a notion of simulation which preserves
the topology in the sense that each cell of the simulated QCA is encoded as a
group of adjacent cells in the universal QCA. We argue that this notion brings
the computer science based concepts of simulation and universality one step

appropriate statistical model. The basic assumption is that there is an
irreducible uncertainty in the location of particles: positions constitute a
configuration space and the corresponding probability distributions constitute
a statistical manifold. The dynamics follows from a principle of inference, the
method of Maximum Entropy. The concept of time is introduced as a convenient
way to keep track of change. A welcome feature is that the entropic dynamics
notion of time incorporates a natural distinction between past and future. The
statistical manifold is assumed to be a dynamical entity: its curved and
evolving geometry determines the evolution of the particles which, in their
turn, react back and determine the evolution of the geometry. Imposing that the
dynamics conserve energy leads to the Schroedinger equation and to a natural
explanation of its linearity, its unitarity, and of the role of complex
numbers. The phase of the wave function is explained as a feature of purely
statistical origin. There is a quantum analogue to the gravitational
equivalence principle.

based on Bell's and demands that local hidden variables are physical, the idea
being that, if discovered, they would not contradict basic physical principles.
We explain why the recent supposed &quot;counterexamples&quot; that have appeared are not

  State-Estimation</title><description>  In this paper we consider the problem of tracking the state of a quantum
system via a continuous measurement. If the system Hamiltonian is known
precisely, this merely requires integrating the appropriate stochastic master
equation. However, even a small error in the assumed Hamiltonian can render
this approach useless. The natural answer to this problem is to include the
parameters of the Hamiltonian as part of the estimation problem, and the full
Bayesian solution to this task provides a state-estimate that is robust against
uncertainties. However, this approach requires considerable computational
overhead. Here we consider a single qubit in which the Hamiltonian contains a
single unknown parameter. We show that classical frequency estimation
techniques greatly reduce the computational overhead associated with Bayesian

  Experiment</title><description>  The influence of the geometric phase on a Bell measurement, as proposed by
Bertlmann et al. in [Phys. Rev. A 69, 032112 (2004)], and expressed by the
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality, has been observed for a spin-path
entangled neutron state in an interferometric setup. It is experimentally
demonstrated that the effect of geometric phase can be balanced by a change in
Bell angles. The geometric phase is acquired during a time dependent
interaction with two radio-frequency (rf) fields. Two schemes, polar and
azimuthal adjustment of the Bell angles, are realized and analyzed in detail.
The former scheme, yields a sinusoidal oscillation of the correlation function
S, dependent on the geometric phase, such that it varies in the range between 2
and 2\sqrt{2} and, therefore, always exceeds the boundary value 2 between
quantum mechanic and noncontextual theories. The latter scheme results in a
constant, maximal violation of the Bell-like-CHSH inequality, where S remains
2\sqrt2 for all settings of the geometric phase.

two-level systems. More specifically, we rigorously reformulate entanglement
transfer process by making use of covariance matrix formalism. When the
resource state is Gaussian, our method makes the approach to the transfer of
quantum correlations much more flexible than in previously considered schemes
and allows the straightforward inclusion of the effects of noise affecting the
CV system. Moreover, the proposed method reveals that the use of de-Gaussified
two-mode states is almost never advantageous for transferring entanglement with

can thus conclude that the entanglement-transfer map overthrows the &quot;ordering&quot;

the amount of randomness that can be extracted from a given source or the
amount of space needed to store given data are normally characterized by one of
two entropy measures, called smooth min-entropy and smooth max-entropy,
respectively. While both entropies are equal to the von Neumann entropy in
certain special cases (e.g., asymptotically, for many independent repetitions
of the given data), their values can differ arbitrarily in the general case.
  In this work, a recently discovered duality relation between (non-smooth)
min- and max-entropies is extended to the smooth case. More precisely, it is
shown that the smooth min-entropy of a system A conditioned on a system B
equals the negative of the smooth max-entropy of A conditioned on a purifying
system C. This result immediately implies that certain operational quantities
(such as the amount of compression and the amount of randomness that can be
extracted from given data) are related. Such relations may, for example, have

connect the mathematical structures used in theoretical models with physical
phenomena, but they also constitute our fundamental assumptions about reality.
Many of the discrepancies between quantum physics and classical physics
(including Maxwell's electrodynamics and relativity) can be traced back to
these categorical foundations. We argue that classical physics corresponds to
the factual aspects of reality and requires a categorical framework which
consists of four interdependent components: boolean logic, the
linear-sequential notion of time, the principle of sufficient reason, and the
dichotomy between observer and observed. None of these can be dropped without
affecting the others. However, in quantum theory the reduction postulate also
addresses the &quot;status nascendi&quot; of facts, i.e., their coming into being.
Therefore, quantum phyics requires a different conceptual framework which will
be elaborated in this article. It is shown that many of its components are
already present in the standard formalisms of quantum physics, but in most
cases they are highlighted not so much from a conceptual perspective but more
from their mathematical structures. The categorical frame underlying quantum
physics includes a profoundly different notion of time which encompasses a
crucial role for the present.

operators); one finds that only the well known (para)statistics of Bose/Fermi
type are allowed by the key principle of local commutativity of observables. In
this frame it was possible to formulate and prove the Spin and Statistics
Theorem purely on the basis of First Principles.
  In a subsequent stage it has been possible to prove the existence of a
unique, canonical algebra of local field operators obeying ordinary Bose/Fermi
commutation relations at spacelike separations. In this general guise the Spin
- Statistics Theorem applies to Theories (on the four dimensional Minkowski
space) where only massive particles with finite mass degeneracy can occur. Here
we describe the underlying simple basic ideas, and briefly mention the
subsequent generalisations; eventually we comment on the possible validity of
the Spin - Statistics Theorem in presence of massless particles, or of
violations of locality as expected in Quantum Gravity.

entangled qubit spacetime histories (or qubit world lines) as a generalized
braid, referred to as a superbraid. The crossing of world lines is purely
quantum in nature, most conveniently expressed analytically with
ladder-operator-based quantum gates. At a crossing, independent world lines can
become entangled. Complicated superbraids are systematically reduced by
recursively applying novel quantum skein relations. If the superbraid is closed
(e.g. representing quantum circuits with closed-loop feedback, quantum lattice
gas algorithms, loop or vacuum diagrams in quantum field theory), then one can
decompose the resulting superlink into an entangled superposition of classical
links. In turn, for each member link, one can compute a link invariant, e.g.
the Jones polynomial. Thus, a superlink possesses a unique link invariant
expressed as an entangled superposition of classical link invariants.

that mode entanglement of a single massive particle can be used for dense

  quantum spin chain</title><description>  In recent work Hartmann et al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 057202 (2009)]
demonstrated that the classical simulation of the dynamics of open 1D quantum
systems with matrix product algorithms can often be dramatically improved by
performing time evolution in the Heisenberg picture. For a closed system this
was exemplified by an exact matrix product operator solution of the
time-evolved creation operator of a quadratic fermi chain with a matrix
dimension of just two. In this work we show that this exact solution can be
significantly generalized to include the case of an open quadratic fermi chain
subjected to master equation evolution with Lindblad operators that are linear
in the fermionic operators. Remarkably even in this open system the
time-evolution of operators continues to be described by matrix product
operators with the same fixed dimension as that required by the solution of a
coherent quadratic fermi chain for all times. Through the use of matrix product
algorithms the dynamical behaviour of operators in this non-equilibrium open
quantum system can be computed with a cost that is linear in the system size.
We present some simple numerical examples which highlight how useful this might
be for the more detailed study of open system dynamics. Given that Heisenberg
picture simulations have been demonstrated to offer significant accuracy
improvements for other open systems that are not exactly solvable our work also
provides further insight into how and why this advantage arises.

prove a general transfer principle that states that every theorem of ZFC set
theory without free variable is, if modified by restricting every unbounded
quantifier appropriately with the notion of commutators, valid in any
orthomodular logic valued models for set theory. This extends the well-known
transfer principle for Boolean-valued models. In order to overcome an unsolved

generalized implications in orthomodular logic by simple requirements satisfied

In view of the close connection between interpretations of quantum mechanics

  Applications</title><description>  We present a design and a top-down fabrication method for realizing diamond
nanowires in both bulk single crystal and polycrystalline diamond. Numerical
modeling was used to study coupling between a Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) color
center and optical modes of a nanowire, and to find an optimal range of
nanowire diameters that allows for large collection efficiency of emitted
photons. Inductively coupled plasma (ICP) reactive ion etching (RIE) with
oxygen is used to fabricate the nanowires. Drop-casted nanoparticles (including
$\mathrm{Au}$, $\mathrm{SiO_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$) as well as electron
beam lithography defined spin-on glass and evaporated $\mathrm{Au}$ have been
used as an etch mask. We found $\mathrm{Al_2O_3}$ nanoparticles to be the most
etch resistant. At the same time FOx e-beam resist (spin-on glass) proved to be
a suitable etch mask for fabrication of ordered arrays of diamond nanowires. We
were able to obtain nanowires with near vertical sidewalls in both
polycrystalline and single crystal diamond. The heights and diameters of the
polycrystalline nanowires presented in this paper are $\unit[\approx1]{\mu m}$
and $\unit[120-340]{nm}$, respectively, having a $\unit[200]{nm/min}$ etch
rate. In the case of single crystal diamond (types Ib and IIa) nanowires the
height and diameter for different diamonds and masks shown in this paper were
$\unit[1-2.4]{\mu m}$ and $\unit[120-490]{nm}$ with etch rates between

an outstanding challenge in quantum science and technology. Here, at the
transition from many to single photon optical communication systems, fully
quantum mechanical effects may be utilized to achieve new capabilities, most
notably perfectly secure communication via quantum cryptography. Practical
implementations place stringent requirements on the device properties,
including stable photon generation, room temperature operation, and efficient
extraction of many photons. Single photon light emitting devices based on
fluorescent dye molecules, quantum dots, and carbon nanotube material systems
have all been explored, but none have simultaneously demonstrated all criteria.
Here, we describe the design, fabrication, and characterization of a bright
source of single photons consisting of an individual Nitrogen-vacancy color
center (NV center) in a diamond nanowire operating in ambient conditions. The
nanowire plays a positive role in increasing the number of single photons
collected from the NV center by an order of magnitude over devices based on
bulk diamond crystals, and allows operation at an order of magnitude lower
power levels. This result enables a new class of nanostructured diamond devices
for room temperature photonic and quantum information processing applications,
and will also impact fields as diverse as biological and chemical sensing,
opto-mechanics, and scanning-probe microscopy.

associated with spin qubits can be effectively amplified to enable a coherent

investigate the steady state entanglement in a three-qubit $XX$ model. Both
symmetric and nonsymmetric qubit-qubit couplings are considered. The system
(the three qubits) is coupled to two bosonic baths at different temperatures.
We calculate the steady state by the effective Hamiltonian approach and discuss
the dependence of the steady state entanglement on the temperatures and
couplings. The results show that for symmetric qubit-qubit couplings, the
entanglements between the nearest neighbor are equal, independent of the
temperatures of the two baths. The maximum of the entanglement arrives at
$T_L=T_R$. For nonsymmetric qubit-qubit couplings, however, the situation is
totally different. The baths at different temperatures would benefit the
entanglement and the entanglements between the nearest neighbors are no longer
equal. By examining the probability distribution of each eigenstate in the
steady state, we present an explanation for these observations. These results
suggest that the steady entanglement can be controlled by the temperature of
the two baths.

We show that for the ground state at the critical value of the trapping

perturbations of quantum evolutions. For weak perturbations its decay rate is
given by the width of the local density of states (LDOS). When the perturbation
is strong enough, it has been shown in chaotic systems that its decay is
dictated by the classical Lyapunov exponent. However, several recent studies
have shown an unexpected non-uniform decay rate as a function of the
perturbation strength instead of that Lyapunov decay. Here we study the
systematic behavior of this regime in perturbed cat maps. We show that some
perturbations produce coherent oscillations in the width of LDOS that imprint
clear signals of the perturbation in LE decay. We also show that if the
perturbation acts in a small region of phase space (local perturbation) the
effect is magnified and the decay is given by the width of the LDOS.

computation. The magic states are pure non-stabilizer states which can be
distilled from certain mixed non-stabilizer states via Clifford group
operations alone. Because of the Gottesman-Knill theorem, mixtures of Pauli
eigenstates are not expected to be magic state distillable, but it has been an
open question whether all mixed states outside this set may be distilled. In
this Letter we show that, when resources are finitely limited, non-distillable
states exist outside the stabilizer octahedron. In analogy with the bound
entangled states, which arise in entanglement theory, we call such states bound
states for magic state distillation.

measurement that appear in quantum mechanics. We hypothesize that the structure
of the wave function for a quantum system at the sub-Planck scale has a
deterministic cyclic structure. Each cycle comprises a sequential succession of
the eigenstates that comprise a given wave function. Between unitary operations
or measurements on the wave function, the sequential arrangement of the current
eigenstates chosen by the system is immaterial, but once chosen it remains
fixed until another unitary operation or measurement changes the wave function.
The probabilistic aspect of quantum mechanics is interpreted by hypothesizing a
measurement mechanism which acts instantaneously but the instant of measurement
is chosen randomly by the classical measuring apparatus over a small but finite
interval from the time the measurement apparatus is activated. At the instant
the measurement is made, the wave function irrevocably collapses to a new state
(erasing some of the past quantum information) and continues from thereon in
that state till changed by a unitary operation or a new measurement.

systems subject to decoherent interactions with the reservoir relax towards
their ground state in the weak coupling limit. Within the framework of quantum
master equations, this is formalized by the Born-Markov-secular (BMS)
approximation, where one obtains the system Gibbs state with the reservoir
temperature as a stationary state. When the solution to some problem is encoded
in the (isolated) ground state of a system Hamiltonian, decoherence can
therefore be exploited for computation. The computational complexity is then
given by the scaling of the relaxation time with the system size $n$.
  We study the relaxation behavior for local and non-local Hamiltonians that
are coupled dissipatively with local and non-local operators to a bosonic bath
in thermal equilibrium. We find that relaxation is generally more efficient
when coherences of the density matrix in the system energy eigenbasis are taken
into account. In addition, the relaxation speed strongly depends on the matrix
elements of the coupling operators between initial state and ground state.
  We show that Dicke superradiance is a special case of our relaxation models
and can thus be understood as a coherence-assisted relaxation speedup.

second partial measurement restores the initial state. This procedure

screen. Feynman famously warned that temptation to &quot;understand&quot; such a puzzling
feature only draws us into blind alleys. Nevertheless, we gain insight into
this feature by drawing an analogy between the double slit experiment and a
time reversed fire alarm. Much as closing the slit increases probability of a
future detection, ruling out fire drill scenarios, having heard the fire alarm,
increases probability of a past fire (using Bayesian inference). Classically,
Bayesian inference is associated with computing probabilities of past events.
We therefore identify this feature of the double slit experiment with a time
reversed thermodynamic arrow. We believe that much of the enigma of quantum

of this, we employ a plausible formulation of the thermodynamic arrow to derive
an uncertainty in classical mechanics that is reminiscent of quantum

class of problems in which we need to determine parts of an array and then
apply a specified function to each independent part. Since present quantum
computers are not robust enough for code writing and execution, we will build a
model of a vector quantum computer that implements the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
from a machine language view using the APL2 programming language. The core of
the method is an operator (DJBOX) which allows evaluation of an arbitrary
function f by the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. Two key functions of the method are
GET_PARTITION and CALC_WITH_PARTITIONS. The GET_PARTITION function determines
parts of an array based on the function f. The CALC_WITH_PARTITIONS function
determines parts of an array based on the function f and then applies another
function to each independent part. We will imagine the method is implemented on
the above vector quantum computer. We will show that the method can be
successfully executed.

  states</title><description>  A functional analysis of the task of observing multiple macroscopic quantum
systems over an extended period of time and then reporting the accumulated
results is used to investigate the information that must be encoded in the
&quot;ready&quot; state |O^r&gt; of any finite, macroscopic observer O capable of performing
this task. Decoherence considerations show that this task can be considered as
involving local observations under classical conditions (LOCC), allowing the
use of classical automata theory to define a minimal observer. It is shown that
such a minimal observer must implement a functional architecture equivalent to
a classical Turing machine and must encode in |O^r&gt; a classical specification
of the complete set of reportable apparatus states. The observation task is
then re-characterized employing an explicit model of such a minimal observer,
and it is shown that both the assumption that external systems have
well-defined boundaries against the environment and the assumption of
decoherence are unnecessary for the characterization of measurements made by a
minimal observer. It is shown that the observables available to a minimal
observer are positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) and that the measurement
results reported by a minimal observer comply with the Born rule. The
differences in underlying physical assumptions between this &quot;systems-free&quot;
treatment of observation and that traditionally employed in analyses of quantum
measurement and quantum communication are discussed.

Hamlet effect. We consider an especial, abstract, &quot;unstable&quot; quantum system
whose dynamical evolution during a small time interval is interrupted by
frequent measurements. Here three different final situations exist. First one
corresponds to quantum Zeno effect, second one - to quantum anti-Zeno effect
and third one - to so-called quantum Hamlet effect. By quantum Zeno effect
final &quot;non-decay&quot; probability is function of number of the decay measurements
variable and &quot;dynamical degree&quot; parameter equivalent to two. When measurements
number tends toward infinity &quot;non-decay&quot; probability has the one limit, or, it
tends analytically toward one and system stands &quot;non-decayed&quot;. By quantum
anti-Zeno effect final &quot;non-decay&quot; probability is function of number of the
decay measurements variable and &quot;dynamical degree&quot; parameter equivalent to one.
When measurements number tends toward infinity &quot;non-decay&quot; probability has the
zero limit, or, it tends analytically toward zero and system becomes &quot;decayed&quot;.
By quantum Hamlet effect, final &quot;non-decay&quot; probability is function of two
variable, number of the decay measurements and &quot;dynamical degree&quot;. When
measurements number tends toward infinity and &quot;dynamical degree&quot; toward one,
final &quot;non-decay&quot; probability depends not only of final value of given
variables, but, also, on the ways on which given variables tends toward their
final values. It means that final &quot;no-decay&quot; probability has not (analytical)
limit, or that there is no {\it analytical} prediction on the final &quot;no-decay&quot;
probability. To be &quot;decayed&quot; or &quot;no-decayed&quot; that is analytically unsolvable
question for given quantum system.

the NV-center in the lattice lead to different dependences on the magnitude and
the orientation of an external static magnetic field. Experimental results
obtained with a continuous microwave excitation are in good agreement with

This variation is explained by the mixing between mS = 0 and mS = $\pm$1 spin

a subclass of path entangled number states. We consider two cases. The first
involves the N-photon absorption properties of the ideal N00N state, one that
does not include spectral information. We study how the N-photon absorption
probability of this state scales with N. We compare this to the absorption
probability of various other states. The second case is that of two-photon
absorption for an N = 2 N00N state generated from a type II spontaneous down
conversion event. In this situation we find that the absorption probability is
both better than analogous coherent light (due to frequency entanglement) and
highly dependent on the optical setup. We show that the poor production rates
of quantum states of light may be partially mitigated by adjusting the spectral
parameters to improve their two-photon absorption rates. This work has
application to quantum imaging, particularly quantum lithography, where the
N-photon absorbing process in the lithographic resist must be optimized for
practical applications.

square-root in time trajectory behaves as a universal stopper of classical
particles regardless of their initial velocities, we compare linear in time and
square-root in time expansions of a box to achieve efficient atom cooling. For
the quantum single-atom wavefunctions studied the square-root in time expansion
presents important advantages: asymptotically it leads to zero average energy
whereas any linear in time (constant box-wall velocity) expansion leaves a
non-zero residual energy, except in the limit of an infinitely slow expansion.
For finite final times and box lengths we set a number of bounds and cooling
principles which again confirm the superior performance of the square-root in
time expansion, even more clearly for increasing excitation of the initial
state. Breakdown of adiabaticity is generally fatal for cooling with the linear
expansion but not so with the square-root expansion.

  operators</title><description>  Spatial qudit states can be realized by using multi-slits to discretize the
transverse momentum of a photon. The merit of this kind of spatial qudit states
is that the implementation of higher dimensional qudits is relatively easy. As
we have recently shown, the quantum states of these spatial qudits can be
analyzed by scanning a single interference pattern. This method of single scan
tomography can also be applied at higher dimensions, but the reconstruction
becomes more sensitive to smaller details of the scanned patterns as the
dimensions increase. In this paper, we investigate the effect of finite
measurement resolution on the single scan tomography of spatial qutrits.
Realistic measurement operators describing the spatial resolution of the
measurement are introduced and the corresponding pattern functions for quantum
state reconstruction are derived. We use the pattern functions to analyze
experimental results for entangled pairs of spatial qutrits generated by
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). It is shown that a reliable
reconstruction of the quantum state can be achieved with finite measurement
resolution if this limitation of the measurement is included in the pattern
functions of single scan tomography.

indeed, it is impossible even for the simple butterfly network. As additional
resource we allow free classical communication between any pair of network
nodes. It is shown that perfect quantum network coding is achievable in this
model whenever classical network coding is possible over the same network when
replacing all quantum capacities by classical capacities. More precisely, it is
proved that perfect quantum network coding using free classical communication
is possible over a network with $k$ source-target pairs if there exists a
classical linear (or even vector linear) coding scheme over a finite ring. Our
proof is constructive in that we give explicit quantum coding operations for

quantum resources to allow N remote distrustful parties to roll an N-sided dice

In addition, we present a six-round three-sided dice rolling protocol,

performed by making use of a unitary evolution only. However, by means of a
unitary-reduction process it can be probabilistically modified. Here we study
in detail the problem of mapping two known pure states onto other two states in
such a way that the final inner product between the outcome states is different
from the inner product of the initial states. In this way we design an optimal
non-orthogonal quantum state preparation scheme by starting from an orthonormal
basis. In this scheme the absolute value of the inner product can be reduced
only probabilistically whereas it can be increased deterministically. Our
analysis shows that the phases of the involved inner products play an important
role in the increase of the success probability of the desired process.

polarized light fields in a single spatial mode at very limited experimental
cost. To implement the scheme, the only measurements needed are the Nth-order
intensity moments after the light beam has passed through two quarter-wave
plates, one half-wave plate, and a polarizing beam splitter for specific
settings of the wave plates. It is shown that this method can be applied for
arbitrarily large N. A set of explicit values is given for the settings of the

fluctuation spectrum generates Casimir-like effective forces acting on its
confining surfaces. Near a continuous phase transition of such a medium the
corresponding order parameter fluctuations occur on all length scales and
therefore close to the critical point this effect acquires a universal
character, i.e., to a large extent it is independent of the microscopic details
of the actual system. Accordingly it can be calculated theoretically by
studying suitable representative model systems.
  We report on the direct measurement of critical Casimir forces by total
internal reflection microscopy (TIRM), with femto-Newton resolution. The
corresponding potentials are determined for individual colloidal particles
floating above a substrate under the action of the critical thermal noise in
the solvent medium, constituted by a binary liquid mixture of water and
2,6-lutidine near its lower consolute point. Depending on the relative
adsorption preferences of the colloid and substrate surfaces with respect to
the two components of the binary liquid mixture, we observe that, upon
approaching the critical point of the solvent, attractive or repulsive forces
emerge and supersede those prevailing away from it. Based on the knowledge of
the critical Casimir forces acting in film geometries within the Ising
universality class and with equal or opposing boundary conditions, we provide
the corresponding theoretical predictions for the sphere-planar wall geometry
of the experiment. The experimental data for the effective potential can be
interpreted consistently in terms of these predictions and a remarkable
quantitative agreement is observed.

statistics of an untrusted source in a &quot;Plug &amp; Play&quot; quantum key distribution
(QKD) system. In a passive scheme, three kinds of monitor mode can be adopted:
average photon number (APN) monitor, photon number analyzer (PNA) and photon
number distribution (PND) monitor. In this paper, the security analysis is
rigorously given for APN monitor, while for PNA, the analysis including
statistical fluctuation and random noise, is addressed with a confidence level.
The results show that the PNA can achieve better performance than the APN
monitor and can asymptotically approach the theoretical limit of the PND
monitor. Also, the passive scheme with the PNA works efficiently when the
signal-to-noise ratio ($R^{SN}$) is not too low and so is highly applicable to
solve the untrusted source problem in the QKD system.

excited state interacting with two modes of a radiation field prepared
initially in $l$-photon coherent states. This system is described by two-mode
multiphoton (, i.e., $k_1, k_2$) Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM). For this system
we investigate the occurrence of the revival-collapse phenomenon (RCP) in the
evolution of the single-mode, two-mode, sum and difference quadrature
squeezing. We show that there is a class of states for which all these types of
squeezing exhibit RCP similar to that involved in the corresponding atomic
inversion. Also we show numerically that the single-mode squeezing of the first
mode for $(k_1,k_2)=(3,1)$ provides RCP similar to that of the atomic inversion
of the case $(k_1,k_2)=(1,1)$, however, sum and difference squeezing give
partial information on that case. Moreover, we show that single-mode, two-mode
and sum squeezing for the case $(k_1,k_2)=(2,2)$ provide information on the
atomic inversion of the single-mode two-photon JCM. We derive the rescaled
squeezing factors giving accurate information on the atomic inversion for all
cases. The consequences of these results are that the homodyne and heterodyne
detectors can be used to detect the RCP for the two-mode JCM.

possible physical states and different kinds of correlations in each theory can
be shared to different parties. Over the past few years it has become clear
that both quantum entanglement and non-locality (i.e., correlations that
violate Bell-type inequalities) have limited shareability properties and can
sometimes even be monogamous. We give a self-contained review of these results
as well as present new results on the shareability of different kinds of
correlations, including local, quantum and no-signalling correlations. This
includes an alternative simpler proof of the Toner-Verstraete monogamy
inequality for quantum correlations, as well as a strengthening thereof.
Further, the relationship between sharing non-local quantum correlations and
sharing mixed entangled states is investigated, and already for the simplest
case of bi-partite correlations and qubits this is shown to be non-trivial.
Also, a recently proposed new interpretation of Bell's theorem by Schumacher in
terms of shareability of correlations is critically assessed. Finally, the
relevance of monogamy of non-local correlations for secure quantum key
distribution is pointed out, although, and importantly, it is stressed that not
all non-local correlations are monogamous.

between single-shot readouts of individual qubits. We report entanglement
metrology using a single detection channel with direct access to
ensemble-averaged correlations between two superconducting qubits. Following
validation and calibration of this joint readout, we demonstrate full quantum
tomography on both separable and highly-entangled two-qubit states produced on

perform entanglement metrology with ~95% accuracy and ~98% precision despite
~10% fidelity of single measurements. For the highly entangled states, measured
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt operators reach a maximum value of 2.61+/-0.04 and
entanglement witnesses give a lower bound of ~88% on concurrence. In its
present form, this detector will be able to resolve future improvements in the
production of two-qubit entanglement and is immediately extendable to 3 or 4

elucidate the key concepts that govern the behaviour of the entities that are
subject to the laws of quantum physics. The arrays of complex numbers are kin
to the arrays of 0s and 1s of the early days of computer programming practice.
In this review we present steps towards a diagrammatic `high-level' alternative
for the Hilbert space formalism, one which appeals to our intuition. It allows
for intuitive reasoning about interacting quantum systems, and trivialises many
otherwise involved and tedious computations. It clearly exposes limitations
such as the no-cloning theorem, and phenomena such as quantum teleportation. As
a logic, it supports `automation'. It allows for a wider variety of underlying
theories, and can be easily modified, having the potential to provide the
required step-stone towards a deeper conceptual understanding of quantum
theory, as well as its unification with other physical theories. Specific
applications discussed here are purely diagrammatic proofs of several quantum
computational schemes, as well as an analysis of the structural origin of
quantum non-locality. The underlying mathematical foundation of this high-level
diagrammatic formalism relies on so-called monoidal categories, a product of a
fairly recent development in mathematics. These monoidal categories do not only
provide a natural foundation for physical theories, but also for proof theory,
logic, programming languages, biology, cooking, ... The challenge is to
discover the necessary additional pieces of structure that allow us to predict
genuine quantum phenomena.

subspaces is relevant to quantum information processing, in particular for
initializing the system in pure states or subspace codes. We provide a
linear-algebraic characterization of the dynamical properties leading to
invariance and attractivity of a given quantum subspace. We then construct a
design algorithm for discrete-time feedback control that allows to stabilize a
target subspace, proving that if the control problem is feasible, then the
algorithm returns an effective control choice. In order to prove this result, a
canonical QR matrix decomposition is derived, and also used to establish the
control scheme potential for the simulation of open-system dynamics.

-\frac{Z}{(r^q+\beta^q)^{\frac{1}{q}}}, with the parameters
  Z&gt;0, \beta&gt;0, q \ge 1, it is shown analytically that the potentials and
eigenvalues, E_{\nu\ell}, are monotonic in each parameter. The potential
envelope method is applied to obtain approximate analytic estimates in terms of
the known exact spectra for pure power potentials. For the case q =1, the
Asymptotic Iteration Method is used to find exact analytic results for the
eigenvalues E_{\nu\ell} and corresponding wave functions, expressed in terms of
Z and \beta. A proof is presented establishing the general concavity of the
scaled electron density near the nucleus resulting from the truncated
potentials for all q. Based on an analysis of extensive numerical calculations,
it is conjectured that the crossing between the pair of states
[(\nu,\ell),(\nu',\ell')], is given by the condition \nu'\geq (\nu+1) and \ell'
\geq (\ell+3). The significance of these results for the interaction of an
intense laser field with an atom is pointed out. Differences in the observed
level-crossing effects between the soft potentials and the hydrogen atom
confined inside an impenetrable sphere are discussed.

of an unstable state in the long time region is considered. In 1957 Khalfin
proved that this amplitude tends to zero as $t\to\infty$ more slowly than any
exponential function of $t$. For a time-dependent decay rate $\gamma(t)$
Khalfin's result means that this $\gamma(t)$ is not a constant for large $t$
but that it tends to zero as $t\to\infty$. We find that a similar conclusion
can be drawn for the instantaneous energy of the unstable state for a large
class of models of unstable states: This energy tends to the minimal energy of
the system ${\cal E}_{min}$ as $t\to\infty$ which is much smaller than the
energy of this state for $t$ of the order of the lifetime of the considered
state. Analyzing the transition time region between exponential and
non-exponential form of the survival amplitude we find that the instantaneous
energy of a considered unstable state can take large values, much larger than
the energy of this state for $t$ from the exponential time region. Taking into
account results obtained for a model considered, it is hypothesized that this
purely quantum mechanical effect may be responsible for the properties of broad
resonances such as $\sigma$ meson as well as having astrophysical and
cosmological consequences.

Alternatively, the pump waist can be adjusted such that the amount of noise

abstract the essential categorical features of classical and quantum mechanics
that support various information-theoretic constraints and possibilities, e.g.,
the impossibility of cloning in the latter, and the possibility of
teleportation in both. Another approach, pursued by the authors and various
collaborators, is to begin with a very conservative, and in a sense very
concrete, generalization of classical probability theory--which is still
sufficient to encompass quantum theory--and to ask which &quot;quantum&quot;
informational phenomena can be reproduced in this much looser setting. In this

These include demonstrations that many &quot;inherently quantum&quot; phenomena are in

otherwise. As an example, a set of states in such a theory is broadcastable if,
and only if, it is contained in a simplex whose vertices are cloneable, and
therefore distinguishable by a single measurement. As another example,
information that can be obtained about a system in this framework without
causing disturbance to the system state, must be inherently classical. We also
review results on teleportation protocols in the framework, and the fact that
any non-classical theory without entanglement allows exponentially secure bit
commitment in this framework. Finally, we sketch some ways of formulating our

those who are allowed to use arbitrary strategies, not limited to local
operations, as long as their strategies cannot be used for communication
between them. Study of multi-prover interactive proof systems with no-signaling
provers is motivated by study of those with provers sharing quantum states. The
relation between them is that no-signaling strategies include all the
strategies realizable by provers sharing arbitrary entangled quantum states,
and more.
  This paper shows that two-prover one-round interactive proof systems with
no-signaling provers only accept languages in PSPACE. Combined with the
protocol for PSPACE by Ito, Kobayashi and Matsumoto (CCC 2009), this implies
MIPns(2,1)=PSPACE, where MIPns(2,1) is the class of languages having a
two-prover one-round interactive proof system with no-signaling provers. This
is proved by constructing a fast parallel algorithm which approximates within
an additive error the maximum value of a two-player one-round game achievable
by cooperative no-signaling players. The algorithm uses the fast parallel
algorithm for the mixed packing and covering problem by Young (FOCS 2001).

equations are both widely used to describe the dynamics of open quantum
systems. The connection between these two descriptions is a classic topic in
mathematical physics. One direction was solved by the now famous result due to
Lindblad, Kossakowski Gorini and Sudarshan, who gave a complete
characterisation of the master equations that generate completely positive
semi-groups. However, the other direction has remained open: given a CPT map,
is there a Lindblad master equation that generates it (and if so, can we find
it's form)? This is sometimes known as the Markovianity problem. Physically, it
is asking how one can deduce underlying physical processes from experimental
observations.
  We give a complexity theoretic answer to this problem: it is NP-hard. We also
give an explicit algorithm that reduces the problem to integer semi-definite
programming, a well-known NP problem. Together, these results imply that
resolving the question of which CPT maps can be generated by master equations
is tantamount to solving P=NP: any efficiently computable criterion for
Markovianity would imply P=NP; whereas a proof that P=NP would imply that our
algorithm already gives an efficiently computable criterion. Thus, unless P
does equal NP, there cannot exist any simple criterion for determining when a
CPT map has a master equation description.
  However, we also show that if the system dimension is fixed (relevant for
current quantum process tomography experiments), then our algorithm scales
efficiently in the required precision, allowing an underlying Lindblad master
equation to be determined efficiently from even a single snapshot in this case.
  Our work also leads to similar complexity-theoretic answers to a related
long-standing open problem in probability theory.

study entanglement, a block subsystem is introduced and described by the
density matrix. Density matrices of 1-dimensional models are diagonalized and
the entanglement entropies (the von Neumann entropy and Renyi entropy) are
calculated. In the large block limit, the entropies also approach finite

noise generated from a local quantum quench provides a measure of the
entanglement entropy. Their methods were specific to non-interacting electrons
and the generalization to interacting systems was left as an open question. In
this work, we generalize their result to the Laughlin states. We investigate
the noise generated in the current along the edge of a fractional quantum Hall
state at filling factors $\nu=1/m$, when a quantum point contact, initially
closed, is fully opened at some initial time $t_0=0$. We find that local
quenching in these systems gives time dependent correlation functions that have
universal behavior on sufficiently long time and length scales. We calculate
the noise and full counting statistics for $\nu=1/m$ and find that in general,
the entanglement entropy and noise generated are unrelated quantities. We also
discuss a generalization of this problem to the critical quantum Ising spin

shape complexity (i.e., the disequilibrium times the Shannon entropic power) of
hydrogenic stationary states are investigated in both position and momentum
spaces. First, it is shown that not only the Fisher information and the
variance (then, the Cramer-Rao measure) but also the disequilibrium associated
to the quantum-mechanical probability density can be explicitly expressed in
terms of the three quantum numbers (n, l, m) of the corresponding state.
Second, the three composite measures mentioned above are analytically,
numerically and physically discussed for both ground and excited states. It is
observed, in particular, that these configuration complexities do not depend on
the nuclear charge Z. Moreover, the Fisher-Shannon measure is shown to
quadratically depend on the principal quantum number n. Finally, sharp upper
bounds to the Fisher-Shannon measure and the shape complexity of a general
hydrogenic orbital are given in terms of the quantum numbers.

sudden death (ESD). Similarly, ESD may occur when a Bell state is under the
action of a quantum operation generated by a Hamiltonian in the presence of a

  problems</title><description>  Adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted a lot of attention because small
scale simulations gave hope that it would allow to solve NP-complete problems
efficiently. Later, negative results proved the existence of specifically
designed hard instances where adiabatic optimization requires exponential time.
In spite of this, there was still hope that this would not happen for random
instances of NP-complete problems. This is an important issue since random
instances are a good model for hard instances that can not be solved by current
classical solvers, for which an efficient quantum algorithm would therefore be
desirable. Here, we will show that because of a phenomenon similar to Anderson
localization, an exponentially small eigenvalue gap appears in the spectrum of
the adiabatic Hamiltonian for large random instances, very close to the end of
the algorithm. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic quantum optimization
also fails for these instances by getting stuck in a local minimum, unless the
computation is exponentially long.

  Continuous Variables</title><description>  It is well known that usual quantum teleportation protocols cannot transport
energy. Recently, new protocols called quantum energy teleportation (QET) have
been proposed, which transport energy by local operations and classical
communication with the ground states of many-body quantum systems. In this
paper, we compare two different QET protocols for transporting energy with
electromagnetic field. In the first protocol, a 1/2 spin (a qubit) is coupled
with the quantum fluctuation in the vacuum state and measured in order to
obtain one-bit information about the fluctuation for the teleportation. In the
second protocol, a harmonic oscillator is coupled with the fluctuation and
measured in order to obtain continuous-variable information about the
fluctuation. In the spin protocol, the amount of teleported energy is
suppressed by an exponential damping factor when the amount of input energy
increases. This suppression factor becomes power damping in the case of the
harmonic oscillator protocol. Therefore, it is concluded that obtaining more
information about the quantum fluctuation leads to teleporting more energy.
This result suggests a profound relationship between energy and quantum
information.

Furthermore, we show that the nonclassical states whose the Wigner functions

  By using a parametrized confinement potential, we are able to switch from one

many-body wave function by `exact' diagonalization of the time independent
Schr\&quot;odinger equation. We discuss the relationship between the entanglement

spatial entanglement and Coulomb interaction, which connects maxima (minima) of
the first to minima (maxima) of the latter. We introduce a potential quantum

The ensuing time-energy uncertainty relation involves the uncertainty in the

the energy uncertainty associated with the wave packet at the same time, as
envisaged originally by Bohr. The instantaneous rate of change of the position
expectation value with respect to the simultaneous expectation value of the

  Laser</title><description>  We present a simple approach to realize truly random number generation based
on measurement of the phase noise of a single mode vertical cavity surface
emitting laser (VCSEL). The true randomness of the quantum phase noise
originates from the spontaneous emission of photons and the random bit
generation rate is ultimately limited only by the laser linewidth. With the
final bit generation rate of 20 Mbit/s, the physically guaranteed truly random
bit sequence passes the three standard random tests. Moreover, for the first
time, a {\it continuously} generated random bit sequence up to 14 Gbit is
verified by two additional criteria for its true randomness.

an interferometer. Our approach optimizes over the entire available input
Hilbert space with no constraints, other than fixed total initial photon
number. We optimize to maximize the Fisher information, which is equivalent to
minimizing the phase uncertainty. We find that in the limit of zero loss the
optimal state is the so-called N00N state, for small loss, the optimal state
gradually deviates from the N00N state, and in the limit of large loss the
optimal state converges to a generalized two-mode coherent state, with a finite
total number of photons. The results provide a general protocol for optimizing
the performance of a quantum optical interferometer in the presence of photon
loss, with applications to quantum imaging, metrology, sensing, and information

  Bose-Einstein condensates</title><description>  The interference of two Bose-Einstein condensates, initially in Fock states,
can be described in terms of their relative phase, treated as a random unknown
variable. This phase can be understood, either as emerging from the
measurements, or preexisting to them; in the latter case, the originating
states could be phase states with unknown phases, so that an average over all
their possible values is taken. Both points of view lead to a description of
probabilities of results of experiments in terms of a phase angle, which plays
the role of a classical variable. Nevertheless, in some situations, this
description is not sufficient: another variable, which we call the &quot;quantum
angle&quot;, emerges from the theory. This article studies various manifestations of
the quantum angle. We first introduce the quantum angle by expressing two Fock
states crossing a beam splitter in terms of phase states, and relate the
quantum angle to off-diagonal matrix elements in the phase representation. Then
we consider an experiment with two beam splitters, where two experimenters make
dichotomic measurements with two interferometers and detectors that are far
apart; the results lead to violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality (valid for local-realistic theories, including classical
descriptions of the phase). Finally, we discuss an experiment where particles
from each of two sources are either deviated via a beam splitter to a side
collector or proceed to the point of interference. For a given interference
result, we find &quot;population oscillations&quot; in the distributions of the deviated
particles, which are entirely controlled by the quantum angle. Various versions
of population oscillation experiments are discussed, with two or three
independent condensates.

In the most basic setup, Alice and Bob are modelled as Unruh-DeWitt detectors
for scalar quanta and the only noise in their communication is due to quantum
fluctuations. For this basic setup we here construct the corresponding
information-theoretic quantum channel. We calculate the classical channel
capacity as a function of the spacetime separation and we confirm that the

including those not captured by entanglement. Thus, only states with zero
discord exhibit strictly classical correlations. We prove that these states are
negligible in the whole Hilbert space: typically a state picked out at random
has positive discord; and, given a state with zero discord, a generic
arbitrarily small perturbation drives it to a positive-discord state. These
results hold for any Hilbert-space dimension, and have direct implications on
quantum computation and on the foundations of the theory of open systems. In
addition, we provide a simple necessary criterion for zero quantum discord.
Finally, we show that, for almost all positive-discord states, an arbitrary
Markovian evolution cannot lead to a sudden, permanent vanishing of discord.

in the presence of a single embedded ion, which is assumed to be tightly
confined in a RF trap. In an ultracold ion-atom collision the ion's charge
induces an electric dipole moment in the atoms which leads to an attractive
$r^{-4}$ potential asymptotically. We treat the ion as a static deformation of
the harmonic trap potential and model its short range interaction with the gas
in the framework of quantum defect theory. The molecular bound states of the
ionic potential are not populated due to the lack of any possible relaxation
process in the Tonks-Girardeau regime. Armed with this knowledge we calculate
the density profile of the gas in the presence of a central ionic impurity and
show that a density \textit{bubble} of the order of a micron occurs around the
ion for typical experimental parameters. From these exact results we show that
an ionic impurity in a Tonks gas can be described using a pseudopotential,

  This raises the question whether such models allow Bell's inequalities to be

first principles, using an infinite-series of beam splitters to model
continuous photon loss. This model is general enough to accommodate
stray-photon noise along the propagation, as well as amplitude attenuation. An
explicit analytical expression for the density matrix as a function of
propagation distance is obtained for completely general input states with
bounded photon number in each mode. The result is analyzed numerically for
various examples of input states. For N00N state input, the loss of coherence
and entanglement is super exponential as predicted by a number of previous

generated randomly, the decay of coherence is very different; in fact no worse
than the classical Beer-Lambert law. More surprisingly, there is a plateu at a
mid-range interval in propagation distance where the loss is in fact
sub-classical, following which it resumes the classical rate. The qualitative
behavior of the decay of entanglement for two-mode propagation is also analyzed
numerically for ensembles of random states using the behavior of negativity as

  is self-consistent: the slightly stronger canonical commutation rule Dirac
  missed</title><description>  Dirac's identification of the quantum analog of the Poisson bracket with the
commutator is reviewed, as is the threat of self-inconsistent overdetermination
of the quantization of classical dynamical variables which drove him to
restrict the assumption of correspondence between quantum and classical Poisson
brackets to embrace only the Cartesian components of the phase space vector.
Dirac's canonical commutation rule fails to determine the order of noncommuting
factors within quantized classical dynamical variables, but does imply the
quantum/classical correspondence of Poisson brackets between any linear
function of phase space and the sum of an arbitrary function of only
configuration space with one of only momentum space. Since every linear
function of phase space is itself such a sum, it is worth checking whether the
assumption of quantum/classical correspondence of Poisson brackets for all such
sums is still self-consistent. Not only is that so, but this slightly stronger
canonical commutation rule also unambiguously determines the order of
noncommuting factors within quantized dynamical variables in accord with the
1925 Born-Jordan quantization surmise, thus replicating the results of the
Hamiltonian path integral, a fact first realized by E. H. Kerner. Born-Jordan
quantization validates the generalized Ehrenfest theorem, but has no inverse,
which disallows the disturbing features of the poorly physically motivated
invertible Weyl quantization, i.e., its unique deterministic classical &quot;shadow
world&quot; which can manifest negative densities in phase space.

not be necessary for isolated systems, since typically the states of the
Hilbert space would have properties similar to the ones of the ensemble.
Nevertheless, it is often argued that most of the states of the Hilbert space
are non-physical and not good descriptions of realistic systems. Therefore, to
better understand the actual power of typicality it is important to ask if it
is also a property of a set of physically relevant states. Here we address this
issue, studying if and how typicality emerges in the set of matrix product
states. We show analytically that typicality occurs for the expectation value
of subsystems' observables when the rank of the matrix product state scales
polynomially with the size of the system with a power greater than two. We
illustrate this result numerically and present some indications that typicality
may appear already for a linear scaling of the rank of the matrix product
state.

  multipartite entangled states</title><description>  The invariant-comb approach is a method to construct entanglement measures
for multipartite systems of qubits. The essential step is the construction of
an antilinear operator that we call {\em comb} in reference to the {\em
hairy-ball theorem}. An appealing feature of this approach is that for qubits
(or spins 1/2) the combs are automatically invariant under $SL(2,\CC)$, which
implies that the obtained invariants are entanglement monotones by
construction. By asking which property of a state determines whether or not it
is detected by a polynomial $SL(2,\CC)$ invariant we find that it is the
presence of a {\em balanced part} that persists under local unitary
transformations. We present a detailed analysis for the maximally entangled
states detected by such polynomial invariants, which leads to the concept of
{\em irreducibly balanced} states. The latter indicates a tight connection with
SLOCC classifications of qubit entanglement. \\ Combs may also help to define
measures for multipartite entanglement of higher-dimensional subsystems.
However, for higher spins there are many independent combs such that it is
non-trivial to find an invariant one. By restricting the allowed local
operations to rotations of the coordinate system (i.e. again to the
$SL(2,\CC)$) we manage to define a unique extension of the concurrence to
general half-integer spin with an analytic convex-roof expression for mixed
states.

However, relaxing the constraint that in particular the mass matrix be

here we show that the same quartet of Weyl spinors, when coupled by a

the mass matrix is non-zero.The ${\cal PT}$-generalized Dirac equation is also
Lorentz invariant, unitary in time, and CPT respecting, even though as a

While systems with topological ground states have been considered to be

fashion to propose a new approach to quantum gravity and unification. Our
proposed reconciliation of general relativity and quantum field theory is based
on a modification of their graphical instantiations, i.e., Regge calculus and
lattice gauge theory, respectively, which we assume are fundamental to their
continuum counterparts. Accordingly, the fundamental structure is a graphical
amalgam of space, time, and sources (in parlance of quantum field theory)
called a &quot;spacetimesource element.&quot; These are fundamental elements of space,
time, and sources, not source elements in space and time. The transition
amplitude for a spacetimesource element is computed using a path integral with
discrete graphical action. The action for a spacetimesource element is
constructed from a difference matrix K and source vector J on the graph, as in
lattice gauge theory. K is constructed from graphical field gradients so that
it contains a non-trivial null space and J is then restricted to the row space
of K, so that it is divergence-free and represents a conserved exchange of
energy-momentum. This construct of K and J represents an adynamical global
constraint between sources, the spacetime metric, and the energy-momentum
content of the element, rather than a dynamical law for time-evolved entities.
We use this approach via modified Regge calculus to correct proper distance in
the Einstein-deSitter cosmology model yielding a fit of the Union2 Compilation
supernova data that matches LambdaCDM without having to invoke accelerating
expansion or dark energy. A similar modification to lattice gauge theory
results in an adynamical account of quantum interference.

is faster than that of the classical one. In the end, we investigate the

  quantum system</title><description>  The problem of quantifying the difference between evolutions of an open
quantum system (in particular, between the actual evolution of an open system
and the ideal target operation on the corresponding closed system) is important
in quantum control, especially in control of quantum information processing.
Motivated by this problem, we develop a measure for evaluating the distance
between unitary evolution operators of a composite quantum system that consists
of a sub-system of interest (e.g., a quantum information processor) and
environment. The main characteristic of this measure is the invariance with
respect to the effect of the evolution operator on the environment, which
follows from an equivalence relation that exists between unitary operators
acting on the composite system, when the effect on only the sub-system of
interest is considered. The invariance to the environment's transformation
makes it possible to quantitatively compare the evolution of an open quantum
system and its closed counterpart. The distance measure also determines the
fidelity bounds of a general quantum channel (a completely positive and
trace-preserving map acting on the sub-system of interest) with respect to a
unitary target transformation. This measure is also independent of the initial
state of the system and straightforward to numerically calculate. As an
example, the measure is used in numerical simulations to evaluate fidelities of
optimally controlled quantum gate operations (for one- and two-qubit systems),
in the presence of a decohering environment. This example illustrates the
utility of this measure for optimal control of quantum operations in the
realistic case of open-system dynamics.

Within the range of these limits of entanglement angle, the game is follower

  Common Electromagnetic Field</title><description>  We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a pair of qubits made of two-level
atoms separated in space with distance $r$ and interacting with one common
electromagnetic field but not directly with each other. Our calculation makes a
weak coupling assumption but no Born or Markov approximation. We write the
evolution equations of the reduced density matrix of the two-qubit system after
integrating out the electromagnetic field modes. We study two classes of states
in detail: Class A is a one parameter family of states which are the
superposition of the highest energy and lowest energy states, and Class B
states which are the linear combinations of the symmetric and the antisymmetric
Bell states. Our results for an initial Bell state are similar to those
obtained before for the same model derived under the Born-Markov approximation.
However, in the Class A states the behavior is qualitatively different: under
the non-Markovian evolution we do not see sudden death of quantum entanglement
and subsequent revivals, except when the qubits are sufficiently far apart. We
provide explanations for such differences of behavior both between these two
classes of states and between the predictions from the Markov and non-Markovian
dynamics. We also study the decoherence of this two-qubit system.

We show that there exists a pump intensity range, where the transmission and
reflection spectra of the probe field exhibit \textit{simultaneously} occurring
narrow peaks (resonances) whose position is determined by the Raman resonance.
Transmission and reflection coefficients can be larger than unity at pump
intensities of order tens of $\mu$W/cm$^{2}$. When the pump intensity is
outside this region, the peak in the transmission spectrum turns into a narrow
dip. The nature of narrow resonances is attributed to a drastic dispersion of
the nonlinear refractive index in the vicinity of the Raman transition, which

When the oscillators only interact through the environment, three dynamical

two-vertex graph with any regular graph has perfect state transfer. This
generalizes a result of Casaccino et al. [clms09] where the regular graph is a
complete graph or a complete graph with a missing link. In contrast, the
half-join of a weighted two-vertex graph with any weighted regular graph has no
perfect state transfer. This implies that adding weights in a complete
bipartite graph do not help in achieving perfect state transfer. (2) A Hamming
graph has perfect state transfer between each pair of its vertices. This is
obtained using a closure property on weighted Cartesian products of perfect
state transfer graphs. Moreover, on the hypercube, we show that perfect state
transfer occurs between uniform superpositions on pairs of arbitrary subcubes.
This generalizes results of Bernasconi et al. [bgs08] and Moore and Russell

access structures of such schemes can be characterized by an excluded minor

While previous work has shown how to construct quantum secret sharing schemes

In this context the present results prove to be useful; they enable us to

Surprisingly, it has only recently been formalized as a quantum information

area have been restricted to the approach of Reid [PRA 40, 913], which followed
the original EPR argument in considering only two different measurement
settings per side. Here we implement more than two settings so as to be able to

mixed entangled states that are Bell-local (that is, which cannot possibly
demonstrate Bell-nonlocality). Unlike the case of Bell inequalities, increasing
the number of measurement settings beyond two--we use up to six--dramatically
increases the robustness of the EPR-steering phenomenon to noise.

the interferometer is fed with a coherent state of relatively small number of
atoms, and in the presence of realistic experimental noise, the force can be
measured with a sensitivity sufficient to discriminate between thermal and
zero-temperature regimes of the Casimir-Polder potential. Higher sensitivities
can be reached with spin squeezed states.

are placed on the same footing in terms of quantum-circuit diagrams. Circuit
equivalences are used to demonstrate the equivalence of protocols that achieve
the Heisenberg limit by employing entangled superpositions of Fock states, such
as N00N states. The key equivalences are those that disentangle a circuit so
that phase information is written exclusively on a mode or modes or on a qubit.
The Fock-state-superposition phase-estimation circuits are converted to use
entangled coherent-state superpositions; the resulting protocols are more
amenable to realization in the lab, particularly in a qubit/cavity setting at

Quantum Mechanics program (due to Abramsky, Coecke, et al) to braided systems.
In our view a uniform description of quantum information for braided systems
has not yet emerged. The picture is complicated by a diversity of examples that
lacks a unifying framework for proving theorems and discovering new protocols.
  We use category theory to construct a high-level language that abstracts the
quantum mechanical properties of braided systems. We exploit this framework to
propose an axiomatic description of braided quantum information intended for
topological quantum computation.
  In this installment we first generalize the primordial Abramsky-Coecke
&quot;quantum information flow&quot; paradigm from compact closed categories to
right-rigid strict monoidal categories. We then study dagger structures for
rigid and/or braided categories and formulate a graphical dagger calculus. We
then propose two generalizations of strongly compact closed categories. Finally
we study partial traces in the context of dagger categories.

Specifically, spatially-separated parties who perform local measurements on a

significant probability, generate nonclassical correlations that violate a Bell
inequality. For n parties using a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, this
probability of violation rapidly tends to unity as the number of parties
increases. We also show that, even with both a randomly chosen two-qubit pure

characterization and detection in fermionic two-particle interferometers at

experiment by the Heiblum group, Neder et al, Nature 448, 333 (2007), realizing
the two particle interferometer proposed by Samuelsson, Sukhorukov, and
Buttiker, Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 026805 (2004). The experiment displayed a clear
two-particle Aharonov-Bohm effect, however with an amplitude suppressed due to
finite temperature and dephasing. This raised qualitative as well quantitative
questions about entanglement production and detection in mesoscopic conductors
at finite temperature. As a response to these questions, in our recent work,
Samuelsson, Neder, and Buttiker, Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 106804 (2009) we
presented a general theory for finite temperature entanglement in mesoscopic
conductors. Applied to the two-particle interferometer we showed that the
emitted two-particle state in the experiment was clearly entangled. Moreover,
we demonstrated that the entanglement of the reduced two-particle state,
reconstructed from measurements of average currents and current cross
correlations, constitutes a lower bound to the entanglement of the emitted
state. The present work provides an extended and more detailed discussion of
these findings.

  Three-Qubit States</title><description>  Any pure three-qubit state is uniquely characterized by one phase and four
positive parameters. The geometric measure of entanglement as a function of
state parameters can have different expressions. Each of expressions has its
own applicable domain and thus the whole state parameter space is divided into
subspaces that are ranges of definition for corresponding expressions. The
purpose of this paper is to examine the applicable domains for the most general
qubit-interchange symmetric three-qubit states. First, we compute the
eigenvalues of the non-linear eigenvalue equations and the nearest separable
states for the permutation invariant three-qubit states with a fixed phase.
Next, we compute the geometric entanglement measure, deduce the boundaries of
all subspaces, and find allocations of highly and slightly entangled states. It
is shown that there are three applicable domains when the phase factor is
$\pi/2$ while other cases have only two domains. The emergence of the three
domains is due to the appearance of the additional W-state. We show that most
of highly entangled states reside near the boundaries of the domains and states
located far from the boundaries become less-entangled and eventually go to the
product states. The neighbors of W-state are generally more entangled than the
neighbors of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger(GHZ) state from the aspect of the
geometric measure. However, the range of the GHZ-neighbors is much more wider
than the range of the W-neighbors.

the three-level system with degenerate ground states might have different
behaviors depending on the details of the interaction with the heat bath when
the temperature approaches zero. If we introduce an external field to break the
degeneracy of the ground states and let it approach zero after letting the
temperature approach zero, then two possibilities will arise: the steady state
is a definite one of the degenerate states independent of the initial state, or
the steady state is dependent on the initial state in a complicated way. The
first possibility corresponds to a spontaneous symmetry breaking of the system
and the second one implies that the heat bath could not totally erase the

crossings of eigenvalue trajectories of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. The phases
of the eigenfunctions are not rigid so that environmentally induced
spectroscopic redistribution processes may take place and a dynamical phase
transition may occur. Due to the formal equivalence between the quantum
mechanical Schr\&quot;odinger equation and the optical wave equation in PT symmetric
lattices, the dynamics of the system is determined also in this case by avoided
and true crossings of eigenvalue trajectories of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.
In contrast to the eigenvalues characterizing an open quantum system, the
eigenvalues describing the PT symmetric optical lattice are real as long as the
influence of the environment (lattice) onto the optical wave equation is small.
In the regime of avoided level crossings, the symmetry is destroyed, the
eigenvalues become complex and a dynamical phase transition occurs similar as
in the open quantum system. The redistribution processes in the regime of
avoided level crossings allow to design systems with desired properties in a
broad parameter range.

illustrates the difference between classical and quantum mechanics. The
principle bounds the uncertainties about the outcomes of two incompatible

cannot predict the outcomes for both possible choices of measurement to
arbitrary precision, even if information about the preparation of the particle
is available in a classical memory. However, if the particle is prepared
entangled with a quantum memory, a device which is likely to soon be available,
it is possible to predict the outcomes for both measurement choices precisely.

in which each qubit is affected by noise, independently of the other qubits. In
this paper we study a different noise model -- one in which the noise may be
correlated with the qubits it acts upon.
  We show both positive and negative results. On the one hand, we show
controlled-X errors cannot be perfectly corrected, yet can be approximately
corrected with sub-constant approximation error. On the other hand, we show
that no non-trivial quantum error correcting code can approximately correct
controlled phase error with sub-constant approximation error.

transition rates based on the quark model. Their starting point was a
Lorentz-invariant differential equation. This equation can be separated into a
Klein-Gordon equation for the free-moving hadron and a harmonic oscillator
equation for the quarks inside the hadron. However, their solution of the
oscillator equation is not consistent with the existing rules of quantum
mechanics and special relativity. On the other hand, their partial differential
equation has many other solutions depending on boundary conditions. It is noted
that there is a Lorentz-covariant set of solutions totally consistent with
quantum mechanics and special relativity. This set constitutes a representation
of the Poincar\'e group which dictates the fundamental space-time symmetry of
particles in the Lorentz-covariant world. It is then shown that the same set of
solutions can be used as the mathematical basis for two-photon coherent states
or squeezed states in quantum optics. It is thus possible to transmit the
physics of squeezed states into the hadronic world. While the time-like
separation is the most puzzling problem in the covariant oscillator regime,
this variable can be interpreted like the unobserved photon in the two-mode
squeezed state which leads to an entropy increase.

correction technique wherein a single unitary recovery operation is applied

superposition states, where an object appears to be in different situations at
the same time. The existence of such states has been tested with small objects,
like atoms, ions, electrons and photons, and even with molecules. More
recently, it has been possible to create superpositions of collections of
photons, atoms, or Cooper pairs. Current progress in optomechanical systems may
soon allow us to create superpositions of even larger objects, like micro-sized
mirrors or cantilevers, and thus to test quantum mechanical phenomena at larger
scales. Here we propose a method to cool down and create quantum superpositions
of the motion of sub-wavelength, arbitrarily shaped dielectric objects trapped
inside a high--finesse cavity at a very low pressure. Our method is ideally
suited for the smallest living organisms, such as viruses, which survive under
low vacuum pressures, and optically behave as dielectric objects. This opens up
the possibility of testing the quantum nature of living organisms by creating
quantum superposition states in very much the same spirit as the original
Schr\&quot;odinger's cat &quot;gedanken&quot; paradigm. We anticipate our essay to be a
starting point to experimentally address fundamental questions, such as the
role of life and consciousness in quantum mechanics.

modes of nano-mechanical systems to high-finesse optical cavities, with the
goal of reaching regimes where quantum behavior can be observed and leveraged
toward new applications. To reach this regime, the coupling between these
systems and their thermal environments must be minimized. Here we propose a
novel approach to this problem, in which optically levitating a nano-mechanical
system can greatly reduce its thermal contact, while simultaneously eliminating
dissipation arising from clamping. Through the long coherence times allowed,
this approach potentially opens the door to ground-state cooling and coherent
manipulation of a single mesoscopic mechanical system or entanglement
generation between spatially separate systems, even in room temperature
environments. As an example, we show that these goals should be achievable when
the mechanical mode consists of the center-of-mass motion of a levitated

the generalized Bloch representation. It is shown that an isolated steady state
of the Bloch equation cannot be a center, i.e., that the existence of a unique
steady state implies attractivity and global asymptotic stability. Necessary

derived and applied to different physical models including two- and four-level

Dirac inspired approach. In contrast to much of the work on this case,
requiring a $2N\times 2N$ phase space, particularly when $N$ is even, our
approach is uniformly based on an $N\times N $ phase space grid and thereby
avoids the necessity of having to invoke a `quadrupled' phase space and hence
the attendant redundance. Both $N$ odd and even cases are analysed in detail
and it is found that there are striking differences between the two. While the
$N$ odd case permits full implementation of the marginals property, the even

even case one is led to several equally good definitions of the Wigner
distributions as opposed to the odd case where the choice turns out to be
unique.

contributions of the paper are the following. First, we show that the set of

regular languages. Second, we prove that 1QFAC are at most exponentially more
concise than DFA. Third, we show that the previous bound is tight for families
of regular languages that are not recognized by measure-once (RMO),
measure-many (RMM) and multi-letter 1QFA. % More concretely we exhibit regular
languages $L^0(m)$ for $m$ prime such that: (i) $L^0(m)$ cannot be recognized
by measure-once, measure-many and multi-letter 1QFA; (ii) the minimal DFA that
accepts $L^0(m)$ has $O(m)$ states; (iii) there is a 1QFAC with constant
classical states and $O(\log(m))$ quantum basis that accepts $L^0(m)$. Fourth,
we give a polynomial-time algorithm for determining whether any two 1QFAC are
equivalent. Finally, we show that state minimization of 1QFAC is decidable
within EXPSPACE. We conclude the paper by posing some open problems.

an additional degree of freedom, solutions of the Schroedinger equation give
rise to weights on the enlarged algebra of observables. States in the
associated GNS representation correspond to states on the original algebra
composed with a completely positive unit preserving map. Application of this
map to the functions of the time operator on the large system delivers the
positive operator valued maps which were previously proposed by two of us as

The reversed process, or upconversion of these pairs back to single photons in

  condensate</title><description>  We examine the time evolution of cold atoms (impurities) interacting with an
environment consisting of a degenerate bosonic quantum gas. The impurity atoms
differ from the environment atoms, being of a different species. This allows
one to superimpose two independent trapping potentials, each being effective
only on one atomic kind, while transparent to the other. When the environment
is homogeneous and the impurities are confined in a potential consisting of a
set of double wells, the system can be described in terms of an effective
spin-boson model, where the occupation of the left or right well of each site
represents the two (pseudo)-spin states. The irreversible dynamics of such
system is here studied exactly, i.e., not in terms of a Markovian master
equation. The dynamics of one and two impurities is remarkably different in
respect of the standard decoherence of the spin - boson system. In particular
we show: i) the appearance of coherence oscillations, i) the presence of super
and sub decoherent states which differ from the standard ones of the spin boson
model, and iii) the persistence of coherence in the system at long times. We
show that this behaviour is due to the fact that the pseudospins have an
internal spatial structure. We argue that collective decoherence also prompts
information about the correlation length of the environment. In a one
dimensional configuration one can change even stronger the qualitative
behaviour of the dephasing just by tuning the interaction of the bath.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, we show that the area of an optimized quantum

cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Our study is motivated by the
fact that multiple matter-wave dark solitons may naturally form in such
settings as per our recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 130401 (2008)]. First,
we study the dark soliton interactions and show that the dynamics of
well-separated solitons (i.e., ones that undergo a collision with relatively
low velocities) can be analyzed by means of particle-like equations of motion.
The latter take into regard the repulsion between solitons (via an effective
repulsive potential) and the confinement and dimensionality of the system (via
an effective parabolic trap for each soliton). Next, based on the fact that
stationary, well-separated dark multi-soliton states emerge as a nonlinear
continuation of the appropriate excited eigensates of the quantum harmonic
oscillator, we use a Bogoliubov-de Gennes analysis to systematically study the
stability of such structures. We find that for a sufficiently large number of
atoms, multiple soliton states may be dynamically stable, while for a small
number of atoms, we predict a dynamical instability emerging from resonance
effects between the eigenfrequencies of the soliton modes and the intrinsic
excitation frequencies of the condensate. Finally we present experimental
realizations of multi-soliton states including a three-soliton state consisting
of two solitons oscillating around a stationary one.

(CQT), as developed by Griffiths and others over the past 25 years. The theory
is a version of orthodox(Copenhagen) quantum mechanics, based on the notion
that the unique and mysterious feature of quantum, as opposed to classical,
systems is the simultaneous existence of multiple incompatible representations
of reality, referred to as &quot;frameworks&quot;. A framework is a maximal set of
properties of a system for which probabilities can be consistently defined.
This notion is expressed by saying that a framework provides an exhaustive set
of exclusive alternatives (ESEA), but no single framework suffices to fully
characterize a quantum system. Indeed, the existence of multiple incompatible
frameworks is the hallmark of quantum mechanical behavior. Any prediction of
the theory must be confined to a single framework and combining elements from
different frameworks leads to quantum mechanically meaningless statements. This
&quot;single framework rule&quot; is the precise mathematical statement of Bohr's
complementarity. It is shown that if the microscopic description is assumed to
incorporate these elements in a local setting, then distant entanglements,
macroscopic measurements, wave function collapse and other mysterious features
of quantum behavior follow in a logical manner. The essential elements of the
theory are first explained using the simplest quantum system, a single spin-1/2
degree of freedom at one time.

Demonstrations that a hidden-variable program necessarily requires outcomes of
certain experiments to disagree with the predictions of quantum theory are
called &quot;no-go theorems&quot;. The Bell theorem excludes local hidden variable
theories. The Kochen-Specker theorem excludes noncontextual hidden variable
theories. In local hidden-variable theories faster-that-light-influences are
forbidden, thus the results for a given measurement (actual, or just
potentially possible) are independent of the settings of other measurement
devices which are at space-like separation. In noncontextual hidden-variable
theories the predetermined results of a (degenerate) observable are independent
of any other observables that are measured jointly with it. It is a fundamental
doctrine of quantum information science that quantum communication and quantum
computation outperforms their classical counterparts. If this is to be true,
some fundamental quantum characteristics must be behind better-than-classical
performance of information processing tasks. This chapter aims at establishing
connections between certain quantum information protocols and foundational
issues in quantum theory. After a brief discusion of the most common
misinterpretations of Bell's theorem and a discussion of what its real meaning

a coherent atom-based microscope, comprised of two atomic species used as
target and probe atoms, each in an independently controlled optical lattice.
Precise and dynamic translation of the lattices allows atoms to be brought into
spatial overlap to induce atomic interactions. For this purpose, we have
fabricated two highly stable, hexagonal optical lattices, with widely separted
wavelengths but identical lattice constants using diffractive optics. The
relative translational stability of 12nm permits controlled interactions and
even entanglement operations with high fidelity. Translation of the lattices is
realized through a monolithic electro-optic modulator array, capable of moving
the lattice smoothly over one lattice site in 11 microseconds, or rapidly on
the order of 100 nanoseconds.

Detection of the presence of a spin-1/2 system in a given spin state by a

arbitrary reference frames postulating the description of body dynamics by
differential equations with higher derivatives of coordinates with respect to

a body is considered to be defined if n-th derivative of the body coordinate
with respect to time is a constant (i.e. finite). First, kinematic state of a
free body is postulated to invariable in an arbitrary reference frame. Second,
if the kinematic invariant of the reference frame is the n-th order derivative
of coordinate with respect to time, then the body dynamics is describes by a
2n-th order differential equation. For example, in a uniformly accelerated
reference frame all free particles have the same acceleration equal to the

motor consists of two different interacting atoms placed into a ring-shaped
periodic optical potential -- an optical &quot;bracelet&quot; --, resulting from the
interference of two counter-propagating Laguerre-Gauss laser beams. This
bracelet is additionally threaded by a pulsating magnetic flux. While the first

fixed zero-momentum initial conditions the asymptotic carrier velocity
saturates to a unique, nonzero value which becomes increasingly independent on

games by taking into account different noise channels. Our calculations show
that entanglement can play a crucial role in quantum Parrondo's games. It is
seen that for the maximally entangled initial state in the presence of
decoherence, the quantum phases strongly influence the payoffs for various
sequences of the game. The effect of amplitude damping channel leads to winning
payoffs. Whereas the depolarizing and phase damping channels lead to the losing
payoffs. In case of amplitude damping channel, the payoffs are enhanced in the
presence of decoherence for the sequence AAB. This is because the quantum
phases interfere constructively which leads to the quantum enhancement of the
payoffs in comparison to the undecohered case. It is also seen that the quantum
phase angles damp the payoffs significantly in the presence of decoherence.
Furthermore, it is seen that for multiple games of sequence AAB, under the
influence of amplitude damping channel, the game still remains a winning game.
However, the quantum enhancement reduces in comparison to the single game of
sequence AAB because of the destructive interference of phase dependent terms.
In case of depolarizing channel, the game becomes a loosing game. It is seen
that for the game sequence B the game is loosing one and the behavior of
sequences B and BB is similar for amplitude damping and depolarizing channels.
In addition, the repeated games of A are only influenced by the amplitude
damping channel and the game remains a losing game. Furthermore, it is also
seen that for any sequence when played in series, the phase damping channel
does not influence the game.

that the transport of a single photon in the cavity array can be controlled by
tuning the frequency of either one or two cavities. If one of the cavities in
the array has a tunable frequency, and its frequency is tuned to be larger (or
smaller) than those of other cavities, then there is a photon bound state above
(or below) the energy band of the coupled cavity array. However, if two
cavities in the array have tunable frequencies, then there exist both bound
states and resonant states. When the frequencies of the two cavities are chosen
to be much larger than those of other cavities and the hopping couplings
between any two nearest-neighbor cavities are weak, a single photon with a
resonant wave vector can be trapped in the region between the two
frequency-tunable cavities. In this case, a quantum supercavity can be formed
by these two frequency-tunable cavities. We also study how to apply this photon

analyses of the residuals from the Casimir force experiments performed so far,
and the second recently discussed in this context in R. Decca et al. [Phys.
Rev. D 79, 124021 (2009)]. We show that the former form of the proximity force
approximation overestimates the expected Yukawa force and that the relative
deviation from the exact Yukawa force is of the same order of magnitude, in the
realistic experimental settings, as the relative deviation expected between the
exact Casimir force and the Casimir force evaluated in the proximity force
approximation. This implies both a systematic shift making the actual limits to
the Yukawa force weaker than claimed so far, and a degree of uncertainty in the
alpha-lambda plane related to the handling of the various approximations used
in the theory for both the Casimir and the Yukawa forces. We further argue that
the recently discussed form for the proximity force approximation is
equivalent, for a geometry made of a generic object interacting with an
infinite planar slab, to the usual exact integration of any additive two-body
interaction, without any need to invoke approximation schemes. If the planar
slab is of finite size, an additional source of systematic error arises due to
the breaking of the planar translational invariance of the system, and we
finally discuss to what extent this may affect limits obtained on power-law and
Yukawa forces.

described by the Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian with anisotropic exchange
interactions and including an external magnetic field. The system exhibits
first order quantum phase transitions by tuning two parameters, $x$ and $y$, of
the Hamiltonian to specific values. The three-qubit chain is open ended so that
there are two types of pairwise entanglement : nearest-neighbour (n.n.) and
next-nearest-neighbour (n.n.n.). We calculate the ground and thermal state
concurrences, quantifying pairwise entanglement, as a function of the
parameters $x$, $y$ and the temperature $T$. The entanglement threshold and gap
temperatures are also determined as a function of the anisotropy parameter $x$.
The results obtained are of relevance in understanding the entanglement
features of the recently engineered molecular $Cr_{7}Ni$-$Cu^{2+}$-$Cr_{7}Ni$
complex which serves as a three-qubit system at sufficiently low temperatures.

the near infrared in nanodiamonds at liquid helium temperature. The
nanodiamonds are synthesized using a microwave chemical vapor deposition method
followed by nickel implantation and annealing. We show that single defects
exhibit several striking features at cryogenic temperature: the
photoluminescence is strongly concentrated into a sharp zero-phonon line in the
near infrared, the radiative lifetime is in the nanosecond range and the
emission is perfectly linearly polarized. The spectral stability of the defects
is then investigated. An optical resonance linewidth of 4 GHz is measured using
resonant excitation on the zero-phonon line. Although Fourier-transform limited
emission is not achieved, our results show that it might be possible to use
consecutive photons emitted in the near infrared by single defects in diamond
nanocrystals to perform two photon interference experiments, which are at the

Lifshitz's theory of electromagnetic vacuum energy. A permittivity function
that depends continuously on one Cartesian coordinate is chosen, bounded on
each side by homogeneous dielectrics. The result for the Casimir stress is
infinite everywhere inside the inhomogeneous region, a divergence that does not
occur for piece-wise homogeneous dielectrics with planar boundaries. A Casimir
force per unit volume can be extracted from the infinite stress but it diverges
on the boundaries between the inhomogeneous medium and the homogeneous
dielectrics. An alternative regularization of the vacuum stress is considered
that removes the contribution of the inhomogeneity over small distances, where
macroscopic electromagnetism is invalid. The alternative regularization yields
a finite Casimir stress inside the inhomogeneous region, but the stress and
force per unit volume diverge on the boundaries with the homogeneous
dielectrics. The case of inhomogeneous dielectrics with planar boundaries thus
falls outside the current understanding of the Casimir effect.

  Analytical Approximations</title><description>  Random Quantum States are presently of interest in the fields of quantum
information theory and quantum chaos. Moreover, a detailed study of their
properties can shed light on some foundational issues of the quantum
statistical mechanics such as the emergence of well defined thermal properties
from the pure quantum mechanical description of large many body systems. When
dealing with an ensemble of pure quantum states, two questions naturally arise:
what is the probability density function on the parameters which specify the
state of the system in a given ensemble? And, does there exist a most typical
value of a function of interest in the considered ensemble? Here two different
ensembles are considered: the Random Pure State Ensemble (RPSE) and the Fixed
Expectation Energy Ensemble (FEEE). By means of a suitable parameterization of
the wave function in terms of populations and phases, we focus on the
probability distribution of the populations in such ensembles. A comparison is
made between the distribution induced by the inherent geometry of the Hilbert
Space and an approximate distribution derived by means of the minimization of
the informational functional. While the latter can be analytically handled, the
exact geometrical distribution is sampled by a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
The analysis is made for an ensemble of wavefunctions describing an ideal
system composed of n spins 1/2 and reveals the salient differences between the
geometrical and the approximate distributions. The analytical approximations
are proven to be useful tools in order to obtain ensemble averaged quantity. In
particular we focus on the distribution of the Shannon entropy by providing an
explanation of the emergence of a typical value of this quantity in the
ensembles.

Heyting algebra structure of S(A). The key difference between this logic and
its classical counterpart is that the former does not satisfy the law of the
excluded middle, and hence is intuitionistic. When A contains sufficiently many
projections (e.g. when A is a von Neumann algebra, or, more generally, a

the construction of quantum logic gates, where the inverse transformations back

to quantum computing. It is a generalization of the well-known satisfiability
problem from classical to quantum computation. This problem is shown to be
surprisingly hard: it is complete for the class QIP of problems that have
quantum interactive proof systems, which implies that it is hard for the class
PSPACE of problems solvable by a classical computation in polynomial space.
  Several restrictions of distinguishability are also shown to be hard. It is
no easier when restricted to quantum computations of logarithmic depth, to
mixed-unitary channels, to degradable channels, or to antidegradable channels.
These hardness results are demonstrated by finding reductions between these
classes of quantum channels. These techniques have applications outside the
distinguishability problem, as the construction for mixed-unitary channels is
used to prove that the additivity problem for the classical capacity of quantum
channels can be equivalently restricted to the mixed unitary channels.

conversion (PDC) relies on perfect photon-number correlations in the output
modes. Correlations in any other degree of freedom, however, degrade the purity
of the heralded state. In this paper, we investigate spectral entanglement
between the two output modes of a periodically poled waveguide. With the intent
of generating heralded 1- and 2-photon Fock states, we expand the output state
of the PDC to second order in photon number. We explore the effects of spectral
filtering and inefficient detection, of the heralding mode, on the count rate,
g(2) and purity of the heralded state, as well as the fidelity between the
resulting state and an ideal Fock state. We find that filtering can decrease
spectral correlations, however, at the expense of the count rate and increased
photon-number mixedness in the heralded output state. As a physical example, we
model a type II PP-KTP waveguide pumped by lasers at wavelengths of 400 nm, 788
nm and 1930 nm. The latter two allow the fulfillment of extended phase matching
conditions in an attempt to eliminate spectral correlations in the PDC output

the exact description is more difficult, and more complicated observables are
used. The question arises whether a claim of entanglement in the simplified

remains valid if a certain positive linear map connecting the two

stationary-light polaritons in two or three spatial dimensions. When stationary
light is created in the interaction with a uniformly rotating ensemble of
coherently driven double $\Lambda$ atoms, the equation of motion is that of a
massive Schr\&quot;odinger particle in an effective magnetic field. In addition a
repulsive scalar potential emerges which can however be compensated by a
space-dependent detuning. Since the effective interaction area for the
polaritons can be made large, degenerate Landau levels can be created with
degeneracy well above 100. This opens the possibility to study the bosonic
analogue of the fractional quantum Hall effect for interacting stationary-light

resource, indeed almost all multiparty protocols can be written in terms of
graph states including measurement based quantum computation (MBQC), error
correction and secret sharing amongst others. In addition they are at the
forefront in terms of implementations. As such they represent an excellent
opportunity to move towards integrated protocols involving many of these
elements. In this paper we look at expressing and extending graph state secret
sharing and MBQC in a common framework and graphical language related to flow.
We do so with two main contributions.
  First we express in entirely graphical terms which set of players can access
which information in graph state secret sharing protocols. These succinct
graphical descriptions of access allow us to take known results from graph
theory to make statements on the generalisation of the previous schemes to
present new secret sharing protocols.
  Second, we give a set of necessary conditions as to when a graph with flow,
i.e. capable of performing a class of unitary operations, can be extended to
include vertices which can be ignored, pointless measurements, and hence
considered as unauthorised players in terms of secret sharing, or error qubits
in terms of fault tolerance. This offers a way to extend existing MBQC patterns
to secret sharing protocols. Our characterisation of pointless measurements is
believed also to be a useful tool for further integrated measurement based
schemes, for example in constructing fault tolerant MBQC schemes.

characteristics of chaotic and periodic (entrained) solutions differed
significantly and that in the classical limit entanglement was preserved only
in the chaotic-like solutions. However, Duffing oscillators are a highly
idealised toy model. Motivated by a wish to explore more experimentally
realisable systems we now extend our work to an analysis of two coupled SQUID
rings. We observe some differences in behaviour between the system that is
based on SQUID rings rather than on Duffing oscillators. However, we show that
the two systems share a common feature. That is, even when the SQUID ring's
trajectories appear to follow (semi) classical orbits entanglement persists.

  spectroscopy</title><description>  Quantum control and measurement are two sides of the same coin. To affect a
dynamical map, well-designed time-dependent control fields must be applied to
the system of interest. To read out the quantum state, information about the
system must be transferred to a probe field. We study a particular example of
this dual action in the context of quantum control and measurement of atomic
spins through the light-shift interaction with an off-resonant optical probe.
By introducing an irreducible tensor decomposition, we identify the coupling of
the Stokes vector of the light field with moments of the atomic spin state.
This shows how polarization spectroscopy can be used for continuous weak
measurement of atomic observables that evolve as a function of time.
Simultaneously, the state-dependent light shift induced by the probe field can
drive nonlinear dynamics of the spin, and can be used to generate arbitrary
unitary transformations on the atoms. We revisit the derivation of the master
equation in order to give a unified description of spin dynamics in the
presence of both nonlinear dynamics and photon scattering. Based on this
formalism, we review applications to quantum control, including the design of
state-to-state mappings, and quantum-state reconstruction via continuous weak
measurement on a dynamically controlled ensemble.

can construct a new theory of the sort envisioned by several of QM's founders:
a Theory of Exclusively Local Beables (TELB). In particular, the usual quantum
mechanical wave function (a function on a high-dimensional configuration space)
is not among the beables posited by the new theory. Instead, each particle has
an associated ``pilot-wave'' field (living in physical space). A number of
additional fields (also fields on physical space) maintain what is described,
in ordinary quantum theory, as ``entanglement.'' The theory allows some
interesting new perspective on the kind of causation involved in pilot-wave
theories in general. And it provides also a concrete example of an empirically
viable quantum theory in whose formulation the wave function (on configuration
space) does not appear -- i.e., it is a theory according to which nothing
corresponding to the configuration space wave function need actually exist.
That is the theory's \emph{raison d'etre} and perhaps its only virtue. Its
vices include the fact that it only reproduces the empirical predictions of the
ordinary pilot-wave theory (equivalent, of course, to the predictions of
ordinary quantum theory) for spinless non-relativistic particles, and only then
for wave functions that are everywhere analytic. The goal is thus not to
recommend the TELB proposed here as a replacement for ordinary pilot-wave
theory (or ordinary quantum theory), but is rather to illustrate (with a crude
first stab) that it might be possible to construct a plausible, empirically
viable TELB, and to recommend this as an interesting and perhaps-fruitful
program for future research.

system is separable, by implementing the well-known Peres-Horodecki test on the
partial transposes (PTs) of the associated 4 x 4 density matrices. But the full
implementation of the test--requiring that the determinant of the PT be
nonnegative for separability to hold--appears to be, at least presently,
computationally intractable. So, we have previously implemented--using the
auxiliary concept of a diagonal-entry-parameterized separability function
(DESF)--the weaker implied test of nonnegativity of the six 2 x 2 principal
minors of the PT. This yielded an exact upper bound on the separability
probability of 1024/(135 Pi^2) = 0.76854. Here, we extend this line of work by
requiring that the four 3 x 3 principal minors of the PT be nonnegative, giving
us an improved/reduced upper bound of 22/35 = 0.628571. Numerical
simulations--as opposed to exact symbolic calculations--indicate, on the other
hand, that the true probability is certainly less than 1/2. Our combined
analyses lead us to suggest a possible form for the true DESF, yielding a
separability probability of 29/64 = 0.453125, while the best exact lower bound
established so far is (6928-2205 Pi)/2^(9/2) = 0.0348338.

only if either both system superalgebras are supercommutative or both
non-supercommutative with a `quantum symplectic structure' characterized by a

previous results which have pointed out, for some specific problems, a depth

properties including dipole-dipole interactions that scale as n^4 and radiative
lifetimes that scale as n^3. It was proposed a decade ago to take advantage of
these properties to implement quantum gates between neutral atom qubits. The
availability of a strong, long-range interaction that can be coherently turned
on and off is an enabling resource for a wide range of quantum information
tasks stretching far beyond the original gate proposal. Rydberg enabled
capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of
multi-qubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces,
and the potential for simulating quantum many body physics. We review the
advances of the last decade, covering both theoretical and experimental aspects
of Rydberg mediated quantum information processing.

monolayer-coated silver nanoparticles. Electronic propagators or Green's
functions, accounting for the repeated polarization interaction between a
single molecule and its image in a nearby nanoscale metal, are explicitly
computed and used to construct the linear-response properties of the combined

finite lifetime of states appear rigorously and automatically within our
approach and reveal an intricate coupling between molecule and metal not fully
described by previous theories. Self-consistent incorporation of this
quantum-molecular response into the continuum-electromagnetic scattering of the

spin-squeezing parameters are analytically calculated for a spin ensemble in a

This finding shows the general occurrence of sudden vanishing phenomena of
quantum correlations in many-body systems, which here is referred to as
spin-squeezing sudden death (SSSD). It is shown that the SSSD usually occurs
due to decoherence and that SSSD never occurs for some initial states in the

liquid Helium, a strong coupling between the artificial atom and the THz cavity

theory that admits systems, states and measurements. In the quantum and
classical world, our measure reduces to the von Neumann and Shannon entropy
respectively. It can even be used in a quantum or classical setting where we
are only allowed to perform a limited set of operations. In a world that admits
superstrong correlations in the form of non-local boxes, our measure can be
used to analyze protocols such as superstrong random access encodings and the
violation of `information causality'. However, we also show that in such a
world no entropic measure can exhibit all properties we commonly accept in a
quantum setting. For example, there exists no`reasonable' measure of
conditional entropy that is subadditive. Finally, we prove a coding theorem for
some theories that is analogous to the quantum and classical setting, providing

C S
Unnikrishnan has suggested that a dynamical interaction leading to the SSC
would involve spin and perforce gravity, the only known universal force. For
the scattering of two identical particles, he considers [arXiv: gr-qc/0406043]
the interaction of their spins with the gravito-magnetic field generated by
their scattering motion through cosmic matter-energy. There the direct and
particles-exchanged scattering amplitudes accumulate different quantum phases
which provide the relevant bosonic/fermionic sign between them without applying
the ad hoc SSC rule. Here it is shown that the scattering probabilities given
by the standard implementation of SSC in quantum mechanics are actually not
obtained from the above interaction for most initial spin states of the
scattering particles. Instead, an unrealized peculiar dynamical interaction is
required. Further, a spin-gravito-magnetic interaction as above (with caveats)
would result in a large unmeasured spin-orbit coupling type effect on atomic

Neuhauser's result, that with the appropriate choice of phases the standard (or
metaplectic) representation of the discrete symplectic group is faithful also
holds for the anti-unitary operators of the extended group. We also improve on
Neuhauser's result by giving explicit formulae for the (anti-)unitary

the eigenvalues and the order of an arbitrary (anti-)symplectic matrix. The
fact that in prime power dimension the matrix elements belong to a field means
that this can be done using the same techniques which are used to find the
eigenvalues of a matrix defined over the reals-including the use of an
extension field (the analogue of the complex numbers) when the eigenvalues are
not in the base field. We then give an application of these results to
SIC-POVMs (symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued

natural basis for the eigenspace of the Zauner unitary in which SIC-fiducials

We show that in odd prime power dimension d, although there is no Clifford
unitary, there is a Clifford anti-unitary which cycles through the full set of
Wootters-Fields MUBs if d=3 (mod 4). Also, irrespective of whether d=1 or 3

than quantum mechanics, with particular reference to the notion of information
causality recently proposed by Pawlowski et. al. (arXiv:0905.2992). We consider
two entropic quantities, which we term measurement and mixing entropy. In
classical and quantum theory, they are equal, being given by the Shannon and
von Neumann entropies respectively; in general, however, they are very
different. In particular, while measurement entropy is easily seen to be
concave, mixing entropy need not be. In fact, as we show, mixing entropy is not
concave whenever the state space is a non-simplicial polytope. Thus, the
condition that measurement and mixing entropies coincide is a strong constraint
on possible theories. We call theories with this property monoentropic.
Measurement entropy is subadditive, but not in general strongly subadditive.
Equivalently, if we define the mutual information between two systems A and B
by the usual formula I(A:B) = H(A) + H(B) - H(AB) where H denotes the
measurement entropy and AB is a non-signaling composite of A and B, then it can
happen that I(A:BC) &lt; I(A:B). This is relevant to information causality in the
sense of Pawlowski et al.: we show that any monoentropic non-signaling theory
in which measurement entropy is strongly subadditive, and also satisfies a
version of the Holevo bound, is informationally causal, and on the other hand
we observe that Popescu-Rohrlich boxes, which violate information causality,
also violate strong subadditivity. We also explore the interplay between
measurement and mixing entropy and various natural conditions on theories that
arise in quantum axiomatics.

multi-dimensional integrals may be estimated using Monte Carlo methods. In a
previous publication it has been shown that for the simplest, most commonly
applied strategy in continuum Quantum Monte Carlo, the random error in the
resulting estimates is not well controlled. At best the Central Limit theorem
is valid in its weakest form, and at worst it is invalid and replaced by an
alternative Generalised Central Limit theorem and non-Normal random error. In
both cases the random error is not controlled. Here we consider a new `residual
sampling strategy' that reintroduces the Central Limit Theorem in its strongest
form, and provides full control of the random error in estimates. Estimates of
the total energy and the variance of the local energy within Variational Monte
Carlo are considered in detail, and the approach presented may be generalised
to expectation values of other operators, and to other variants of the Quantum
Monte Carlo method.

methods provide a powerful and well established approach to first principles
calculations for large systems. Replacing the exact solution of the problem
with a statistical estimate requires a measure of the random error in the
estimate for it to be useful. Such a measure of confidence is usually provided
by assuming the Central Limit Theorem to hold true. In what follows it is
demonstrated that, for the most popular implementation of the Variational Monte
Carlo method, the Central Limit Theorem has limited validity, or is invalid and
must be replaced by a Generalised Central Limit Theorem. Estimates of the total
energy and the variance of the local energy are examined in detail, and shown
to exhibit uncontrolled statistical errors through an explicit derivation of
the distribution of the random error. Several examples are given of estimated
quantities for which the Central Limit Theorem is not valid. The approach used
is generally applicable to characterising the random error of estimates, and to
Quantum Monte Carlo methods beyond Variational Monte Carlo.

  preparation of arbitrary qubit states</title><description>  Remote state preparation (RSP) is the act of preparing a quantum state at a
remote location without actually transmitting the state itself. Using at most
two classical bits and a single shared maximally entangled state, one can in
theory remotely prepare any qubit state with certainty and with perfect
fidelity. However, in any experimental implementation the average fidelity
between the target and output states cannot be perfect. In order for an RSP
experiment to demonstrate genuine quantum advantages, it must surpass the
optimal threshold of a comparable classical protocol. Here we study the
fidelity achievable by RSP protocols lacking shared entanglement, and determine
the optimal value for the average fidelity in several different cases. We
implement an experimental scheme for deterministic remote preparation of
arbitrary photon polarization qubits, preparing 178 different pure and mixed
qubit states with an average fidelity of 0.995. Our experimentally-achieved
average fidelities surpass our derived classical thresholds whenever the
classical protocol does not trivially allow for perfect RSP.

each replies by one bit to a message that he receives privately; they win the
game if both questions and answers satisfy some predetermined property. A game
is called entangled if the players are allowed to share a priori entanglement.
It is well-known that the maximum winning probability (value) of entangled
XOR-games (binary games in which the predetermined property depends only on the
XOR of the two output bits) can be computed by a semidefinite program. In this
paper we extend this result in the following sense; if a binary game is
uniform, meaning that in an optimal strategy the marginal distributions of the
output of each player are uniform, then its entangled value can be efficiently
computed by a semidefinite program. We also introduce a lower bound on the
entangled value of a general two-player one-round game; this bound depends on
the size of the output set of each player and can be computed by a semidefinite
program. In particular, we show that if the game is binary, w_q is its
entangled value, and w_{sdp} is the optimum value of the corresponding
semidefinite program, then 0.68w_{sdp} &lt; w_q &lt;= w_{sdp}.

of quantum spin models, its use in high-fidelity and robust quantum
communication, and its realization in many-body systems of ultracold atoms in
optical lattices and in arrays of coupled optical cavities. We investigate
different patterns of site-dependent interaction couplings, singling out two
general settings: Patterns that allow for perfect long-distance entanglement
(LDE) in the ground state of the system, namely such that the end-to-end
entanglement remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, and patterns of quasi
long-distance entanglement (QLDE) in the ground state of the system, namely,
such such that the end-to-end entanglement vanishes with a very slow power-law
decay as the length of the spin chain is increased. We discuss physical
realizations of these models in ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms loaded in
optical lattices. We show how, using either suitably engineered super-lattice
structures or exploiting the presence of edge impurities in lattices with
single periodicity, it is possible to realize models endowed with nonvanishing
LDE or QLDE. We then study how to realize models that optimize the robustness
of QLDE at finite temperature and in the presence of imperfections using
suitably engineered arrays of coupled optical cavities. We finally introduce
LDE-based schemes of long-distance quantum teleportation in linear arrays of
coupled cavities and show that they allow for high-fidelity and high success
rates even at moderately high temperatures.

  a p-wave Feshbach Resonance</title><description>  We consider a fully polarized ultracold Fermi gas interacting through a
p-wave Feshbach resonance. Using a two-channel model, we find the effective
potential at the point where the p-wave scattering length goes to zero. Here
the effective interaction provides attraction and one can therefore ask about
the stability of the system. We calculate the energy density of the system in
the Thomas-Fermi approximation, determine the profile of the gas, and the
critical number of particle in the system as function of the relevant
interaction parameters. The instability can be deduced from a simple breathing
mode argument which explains the scaling found numerically. The critical
particle number turns out to be extremely large unless the external confinement
is very tight. We therefore conclude that the effect is insignificant for
standard trapping potentials and that the magnetic dipole interaction is the
important term at zero scattering length. However, for tight confinement as in
an optical lattice higher-order corrections can become important.

passive preparation of a decoy state by monitoring a fraction of the signal via

photon number splitting attacks. We show that the achievable distance increases

secure key generation rate in the case of a poor SPS with $g^{(2)} = 0.19$, in
which no secure key is produced with the conventional QKD scheme, and show that
learning the photon-number distribution up to several numbers is sufficient for
achieving almost the same achievable distance as that of an ideal SPS.

wave functions can be continued analytically to the forward tube T in complex
spacetime. For Klein-Gordon particles, we interpret T as an extended (8D)
classical phase space containing all 6D classical phase spaces as symplectic
submanifolds. The evaluation maps $e_z: f\to f(z)$ of wave functions on T are
relativistic coherent states reducing to the Gaussian coherent states in the
nonrelativistic limit. It is known that no covariant probability interpretation
exists for Klein-Gordon particles in real spacetime because the time component
of the conserved &quot;probability current&quot; can attain negative values even for
positive-energy solutions. We show that this problem is solved very naturally
in complex spacetime, where $|f(x-iy)|^2$ is interpreted as a probability
density on all 6D phase spaces in T which, when integrated over the &quot;momentum&quot;
variables y, gives a conserved spacetime probability current whose time
component is a positive regularization of the usual one. Similar results are
obtained for Dirac particles, where the evaluation maps $e_z$ are spinor-valued
relativistic coherent states. For free quantized Klein-Gordon and Dirac fields,
the above formalism extends to n-particle/antiparticle coherent states whose

method based on the time--evolution superoperator concept, as well as one based
on the Kraus representation of the time-evolution superoperator. Applications
which illustrate these new methods focus on single and double qubits (quantum
gates) whereby the environment is modeled either within the Lindblad equation
or a bath of bosons (spin-boson model). While these approaches are widely
applicable, we shall focus our attention to solid-state based physical
realizations, such as semiconductor- and superconductor-based systems. While an
attempt is made to reference relevant and representative work throughout the
community, the exposition will focus mainly on work which has emerged from our
own group.

strong ac driving. By combing Floquet theory with Van Vleck perturbation theory
in the TLS tunneling matrix element, we diagonalize the time-dependent
Hamiltonian and provide corrections to the renormalized Rabi frequency of the
TLS, which are valid for both a biased and unbiased TLS and go beyond the known
high-frequency and rotating-wave results. In order to mimic environmental
influences on the TLS, we couple the system weakly to a thermal bath and solve
analytically the corresponding Floquet-Bloch-Redfield master equation. We give
a closed expression for the relaxation and dephasing rates of the TLS and
discuss their behavior under variation of the driving amplitude. Further, we
examine the robustness of coherent destruction of tunneling (CDT) and
driving-induced tunneling oscillations (DITO). We show that also for a moderate
driving frequency an almost complete suppression of tunneling can be achieved
for short times and demonstrate the sensitiveness of DITO to a change of the

quantization generally induces a hidden local (time-dependent) gauge symmetry.
This gauge symmetry defines the parallel transport and holonomy, and thus it
controls all the known geometric phases, either adiabatic or non-adiabatic, in
a unified manner. The transitional region from the adiabatic to non-adiabatic
phases is thus analyzed in a quantitative way. It is then shown that the
topology of the adiabatic Berry's phase is trivial in a precise sense and also
the adiabatic phase is rather fragile against the non-adiabatic deformation. In
this formulation, the notion such as the projective Hilbert space does not
appear.

  Space-time</title><description>  It is well-known that the coordinate as a continuous variable, consisting of
a set of all points between 0 and $L$ contradicts the observability of
measurement. In other words there might exist a fundamental length in nature,
such as the Planck length $\lambda_P$, so that it is not possible to measure a
position coordinate with accuracy smaller than this fundamental length. It is
therefore necessary to investigate the formulation of quantum mechanics using
only discrete variables as coordinates. To investigate all of quantum mechanics
or any branch of physics from this approach is of course a daunting task and
thus it is worthwhile to consider a specific simple problem in order to
formulate the basic ideas. In this note we compare the solutions of Schrodinger
equation for one-dimensional free particle under the usual space-time continuum
with those that are obtained when space-time is assumed to be quantized using a
simple model. For this purpose, we replace the derivatives occurring in
Schrodinger equation with the corresponding discrete derivatives. We compute
the probability density (and the probability current) under the two scenarios;
they turn out to be quite different in the two cases. We also obtain the
operator identity for the commutator $[p,x]^q$ under the assumption of
quantized space-time and contrast it with the usual commutator $[p,x]$.

information theory: determining the largest eigenvalue of a sum of p random
product states in (C^d)^{otimes k}, where k and p/d^k are fixed while d grows.
When k=1, the Marcenko-Pastur law determines (up to small corrections) not only
the largest eigenvalue ((1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2) but the smallest eigenvalue
(min(0,1-sqrt{p/d^k})^2) and the spectral density in between. We use the method
of moments to show that for k&gt;1 the largest eigenvalue is still approximately
(1+sqrt{p/d^k})^2 and the spectral density approaches that of the
Marcenko-Pastur law, generalizing the random matrix theory result to the random
tensor case. Our bound on the largest eigenvalue has implications both for
sampling from a particular heavy-tailed distribution and for a recently
proposed quantum data-hiding and correlation-locking scheme due to Leung and
Winter. Since the matrices we consider have neither independent entries nor
unitary invariance, we need to develop new techniques for their analysis. The
main contribution of this paper is to give three different methods for
analyzing mixtures of random product states: a diagrammatic approach based on
Gaussian integrals, a combinatorial method that looks at the cycle
decompositions of permutations and a recursive method that uses a variant of
the Schwinger-Dyson equations.

species in enzyme-catalysed reactions. This study is stimulated by claims that
the observed magnitude and temperature dependence of kinetic isotope effects
imply that quantum tunneling below the energy barrier associated with the
transition state significantly enhances the reaction rate in many enzymes. We
use a path integral approach which provides a general framework to understand
tunneling in a quantum system which interacts with an environment at non-zero
temperature. Here the quantum system is the active site of the enzyme and the
environment is the surrounding protein and water. Tunneling well below the
barrier only occurs for temperatures less than a temperature $T_0$ which is
determined by the curvature of potential energy surface near the top of the
barrier. We argue that for most enzymes this temperature is less than room
temperature. For physically reasonable parameters quantum transition state
theory gives a quantitative description of the temperature dependence and
magnitude of kinetic isotope effects for two classes of enzymes which have been
claimed to exhibit signatures of quantum tunneling. The only quantum effects
are those associated with the transition state, both reflection at the barrier
top and tunneling just below the barrier. We establish that the friction due to
the environment is weak and only slightly modifies the reaction rate.
Furthermore, at room temperature and for typical energy barriers environmental
degrees of freedom with frequencies much less than 1000 cm$^{-1}$ do not have a
significant effect on quantum corrections to the reaction rate.

  with Josephson Phase Qubits</title><description>  Quantum logic gates must perform properly when operating on their standard
input basis states, as well as when operating on complex superpositions of
these states. Experiments using superconducting qubits have validated the truth
table for particular implementations of e.g. the controlled-NOT gate [1,2], but
have not fully characterized gate operation for arbitrary superpositions of
input states. Here we demonstrate the use of quantum process tomography (QPT)
[3,4] to fully characterize the performance of a universal entangling gate
between two superconducting quantum bits. Process tomography permits complete
gate analysis, but requires precise preparation of arbitrary input states,
control over the subsequent qubit interaction, and simultaneous single-shot
measurement of the output states. We use QPT to measure the fidelity of the
entangling gate and to quantify the decoherence mechanisms affecting the gate
performance. In addition to demonstrating a promising fidelity, our entangling
gate has a on/off ratio of 300, a level of adjustable coupling that will become
a requirement for future high-fidelity devices. This is the first solid-state
demonstration of QPT in a two-qubit system, as solid-state process tomography
has previously only been demonstrated with single qubits [5,6].

  localization by external noise</title><description>  Quantum tunneling in the presence of chaos is analyzed, focusing especially
on the interplay between quantum tunneling and dynamical localization. We
observed flooding of potentially existing tunneling amplitude by adding noise
to the chaotic sea to attenuate the destructive interference generating
dynamical localization. This phenomenon is related to the nature of complex
orbits describing tunneling between torus and chaotic regions. The tunneling
rate is found to obey a perturbative scaling with noise intensity when the
noise intensity is sufficiently small and then saturate in a large noise
intensity regime. A relation between the tunneling rate and the localization
length of the chaotic states is also demonstrated. It is shown that due to the
competition between dynamical tunneling and dynamical localization, the
tunneling rate is not a monotonically increasing function of Planck's constant.
The above results are obtained for a system with a sharp border between torus
and chaotic regions. The validity of the results for a system with a smoothed
border is also explained.

recently entered a renaissance period due to novel intuitions from quantum
information theory and to increasing attention on the dynamical aspects of
single quantum systems. In the present contribution a simple but effective
theoretical framework is introduced to clarify the connections between a purely
mechanical description and the thermodynamic characterization of the
equilibrium state of an isolated quantum system. A salient feature of our
approach is the very transparent distinction between the statistical aspects
and the dynamical aspects in the description of isolated quantum systems. Like
in the classical statistical mechanics, the equilibrium distribution of any
property is identified on the basis of the time evolution of the considered
system. As a consequence equilibrium properties of quantum system appear to
depend on the details of the initial state due to the abundance of constants of
the motion in the Schr\&quot;odinger dynamics. On the other hand the study of the
probability distributions of some functions, such as the entropy or the
equilibrium state of a subsystem, in statistical ensembles of pure states
reveals the crucial role of typicality as the bridge between macroscopic
thermodynamics and microscopic quantum dynamics. We shall consider two
particular ensembles: the random pure state ensemble and the fixed expectation
energy ensemble. The relation between the introduced ensembles, the properties
of a given isolated system, and the standard quantum statistical description
are discussed throughout the presentation. Finally we point out the conditions
which should be satisfied by an ensemble in order to get meaningful
thermodynamical characterization of an isolated quantum system.

this work. We explicitly derive the typical values of the entropy, of the
energy, and of the equilibrium reduced density matrix of a subsystem for the
two different statistics introduced in Part I. In order to analyze their
consistency with thermodynamics, these quantities of interest are evaluated in
the limit of large number of components of the isolated system. The main
results can be summarized as follows: typical values of the entropy and of the
equilibrium reduced density matrix as functions of the internal energy in the
fixed expectation energy ensemble do not satisfy the requirement of
thermodynamics. On the contrary, the thermodynamical description is recovered
from the random pure state ensemble (RPSE), provided that one considers systems
large enough. The thermodynamic limit of the considered properties for the spin
system reveals a number of important features. First canonical statistics (and
thus, canonical typicality as long as the fluctuations around the average value
are small) emerges without the need of assuming the microcanonical space for
the global pure state. Moreover, we rigorously prove (i) the equivalence of the
&quot;global temperature,&quot; derived from the entropy equation of state, with the
&quot;local temperature&quot; determining the canonical state of the subsystems; and (ii)
the equivalence between the RPSE typical entropy and the canonical entropy for

contrast to work in the older tradition, which tended to concentrate on
structural features of individual quantum systems, the newer work is marked by
an emphasis on systems in interaction. Within this newer work, one can discerne
two distinct approaches: one is &quot;top-down&quot;, and attempts to capture in
category-theoretic terms what is distinctive about quantum information
processing. The other is &quot;bottom up&quot;, attempting to construct non-classical
models and theories by hand, as it were, and then characterizing those features
that mark out quantum-like behavior. This paper blends these approaches. We
present a constructive, bottom-up recipe for building probabilistic theories
having strong symmetry properties, using as data any uniform enlargement of the

natural conditions, our construction leads to a monoidal category of fully

  Information</title><description>  Nonperturbative analysis of quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation
protocol using oscillator variables carried by observers in relativistic motion
under the continuous influence of the environment is given. The full time
evolution of quantum entanglement among static and accelerated observers is
studied. The environment plays a dual role. While it creates bipartite and
tripartite entanglement among observers even when the initial state is
separable, it suppresses the entanglement via decoherence. Motivated by the
black hole information problem, we consider quantum teleportation between
static and accelerated observers. Acceleration of the observer suppresses
fidelity of teleportation. Some of the quantum information escapes outside of
the horizon in the form of bipartite and tripartite entanglement during the
teleportation process. Explicit calculation of information loss is provided. In
addition to the loss due to the interaction with the environment, there is an
intrinsic loss originated in a measurement process. We discuss the implications
of our results on the black hole case.

  Gas</title><description>  Spectral line width broadening in Rydberg gases, a phenomenon previously
attributed to the many-body effect, was observed experimentally almost a decade
ago. The observed line width was typically 80-100 times larger than the average
interaction strength predicted from a binary interaction. The interpretation of
such a phenomenon is usually based on the so-called diffusion model, where the
line width broadening mostly originates from the diffusion of excitations. In
this paper, we present a model calculation to show that diffusion is not the
main mechanism to the line width broadening. We find that the rare pair
fluctuation at small separation is the dominant factor contributing to this
broadening. Our results give a width of about 20-30 times larger than the
average interaction strength. More importantly, by turning off the diffusion
process, we do not observe order of magnitude change in the spectral line
width.

This device consists of two modes propagating into two waveguides, each of them
includes a localized and/or a trapped atom. These waveguides are placed close
enough to allow exchanging energy between them via evanescent waves. Each mode
interacts with the atom in the same waveguide in the standard way, i.e. as the
Jaynes-Cummings model (JCM), and with the atom-mode in the second waveguide via
evanescent wave. We present the Hamiltonian for the system and deduce the exact
form for the wavefunction. We investigate the atomic inversions and the
second-order correlation function. In contrast to the conventional linear
coupler, the atomic quantum coupler is able to generate nonclassical effects.
The atomic inversions can exhibit long revival-collapse phenomenon as well as
subsidiary revivals based on the competition among the switching mechanisms in
the system. Finally, under certain conditions, the system can yield the results
of the two-mode JCM.

information transport properties of a medium or material. For this analysis the
special features of quantum information have to be taken into account. We find
that quantum communication over an isotropic medium, as opposed to classical
information transfer, requires the transmitter to direct the signal towards the
receiver. Furthermore, for large classes of media there is a threshold, in the
sense that `sufficiently much' of the signal has to be collected. Therefore,
the medium's capacity for quantum communication can be characterized in terms
of how the size of the transmitter and receiver has to scale with the
transmission distance to maintain quantum information transmission. To
demonstrate the applicability of this concept, an n-dimensional spin lattice is
considered, yielding a sufficient scaling of d^(n/3) with the distance d.

dimensions. In the case of free electrons, it is well known that the propagator
in momentum space takes the simple form $S_F(p)=1/(\gamma\cdot p-m)$. In the
presence of external electromagnetic fields, electron asymptotic states are no
longer plane-waves, and hence the propagator in the basis of momentum
eigenstates has a more intricate form. Nevertheless, in the basis of the
eigenfunctions of the operator $(\gamma\cdot \Pi)^2$, where $\Pi_\mu$ is the
canonical momentum operator, it acquires the free form $S_F(p)=1/(\gamma\cdot
\bar{p}-m)$ where $\bar{p}_\mu$ depends on the dynamical quantum numbers. We
construct the electron propagator in the basis of the $(\gamma\cdot \Pi)^2$
eigenfunctions. In the (2+1)-dimensional case, we obtain it in an irreducible
representation of the Clifford algebra incorporating to all orders the effects
of a magnetic field of arbitrary spatial shape pointing perpendicularly to the
plane of motion of the electrons. Such an exercise is of relevance in graphene
in the massless limit. The specific examples considered include the uniform
magnetic field and the exponentially damped static magnetic field. We further
consider the electron propagator for the massive Schwinger model incorporating
the effects of a constant electric field to all orders within this framework.

assuming f is guaranteed to be constant or balanced. Classically it appears

the well known quantum solution solves the problem with probability one in
exactly one black-box call. It has been found that in some cases the algorithm

are not maximally non-local, and it is natural to ask whether there are
compelling reasons for rejecting theories in which stronger violations are
possible. To shed light on this question, we consider post-quantum theories in
which maximally non-local states (non-local boxes) occur. It has previously
been conjectured that the set of dynamical transformations possible in such
theories is severely limited. We settle the question affirmatively in the case
of reversible dynamics, by completely characterizing all such transformations
allowed in this setting. We find that the dynamical group is trivial, in the
sense that it is generated solely by local operations and permutations of

cannot be prepared from product states (in other words, no analogues of
entangling unitary operations exist), and classical computers can efficiently
simulate all such processes.

  Control of Electronic Excitation Transfer</title><description>  We investigate the control of electronic energy transfer in molecular dimers
through the preparation of specific vibrational coherences prior to electronic
excitation, and its observation by nonlinear wave-packet interferometry.
Laser-driven coherent nuclear motion can affect the instantaneous resonance
between site-excited electronic states and thereby influence short-time
electronic excitation transfer (EET). We first illustrate this control
mechanism with calculations on a dimer whose constituent monomers undergo
harmonic vibrations. We then consider the use of nonlinear wave-packet
interferometry (nl-WPI) experiments to monitor the nuclear dynamics
accompanying EET in general dimer complexes following impulsive vibrational
excitation by a sub-resonant control pulse (or control pulse sequence). In
measurements of this kind, two pairs of polarized phase-related femtosecond
pulses following the control pulse generate superpositions of coherent nuclear
wave packets in optically accessible electronic states. Interference
contributions to the time- and frequency-integrated fluorescence signal due to
overlaps among the superposed wave packets provide amplitude-level information
on the nuclear and electronic dynamics. We derive the basic expression for a
control-pulse-dependent nl-WPI signal. The electronic transition moments of the
constituent monomers are assumed to have a fixed relative orientation, while
the overall orientation of the complex is distributed isotropically. We include
the limiting case of coincident arrival by pulses within each phase-related
pair in which control-influenced nl-WPI reduces to a fluorescence-detected
pump-probe difference experiment. Numerical calculations of pump-probe signals
based on these theoretical expressions are presented in the following paper.

  Transfer</title><description>  The preceding paper describes a strategy for externally influencing the
course of short-time electronic excitation transfer (EET) in molecular dimers
and observing the process by nonlinear wave-packet interferometry (nl-WPI).
Within a sample of isotropically oriented dimers having a specified internal
geometry, a vibrational mode internal to the acceptor chromophore can be
preferentially driven by electronically nonresonant impulsive stimulated Raman
(or resonant infrared) excitation with a short polarized control pulse. A
subsequent electronically resonant polarized pump then preferentially excites
the donor, and EET ensues. Here we test both the control strategy and its
spectroscopic investigation-with some sacrifice of amplitude-level detail-by
calculating the pump-probe difference signal. That signal is the limiting case
of the control-influenced nl-WPI signal in which the two pulses in the pump
pulse-pair coincide, as do the two pulses in the probe pulse-pair. We present
calculated pump-probe difference signals for (1) a model excitation-transfer
complex in which two equal-energy monomers each support one moderately
Franck-Condon active intramolecular vibration; (2) a simplified model of the
covalent dimer dithia-anthracenophane, representing its EET dynamics following
selective impulsive excitation of the weakly Franck-Condon active anthracene
vibration at 385 cm-1; and (3) a model complex featuring moderate
electronic-vibrational coupling in which the site energy of the acceptor
chromophore is lower than that of the donor.

histories of a classical algorithm that knows in advance 50% of the information
about the solution of the problem - each history is a possible way of getting
the advanced information and a possible result of computing the missing
information. We gave a theoretical justification of this 50% advanced
information rule and checked that it holds for a large variety of quantum
algorithms. Now we discuss the theoretical justification in further detail and
counter a possible objection. We show that the rule is the generalization of a
simple, well known, explanation of quantum nonlocality - where logical
correlation between measurement outcomes is physically backed by a
causal/deterministic/local process with causality allowed to go backward in
time with backdated state vector reduction. The possible objection is that
quantum algorithms often produce the solution of the problem in an apparently
deterministic way (when their unitary part produces an eigenstate of the
observable to be measured and measurement produces the corresponding eigenvalue
- the solution - with probability 1), while the present explanation of the
speed up relies on the nondeterministic character of quantum measurement. We
show that this objection would mistake the nondeterministic production of a
definite outcome for a deterministic production.

compatible with the Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol which suits
single-mode as well as multi-mode threshold detectors. The proof shows that,
when a given detector is symmetric under cyclic group C_4, and a certain
observable associated with it has rank two as a matrix, then there always
exists a corresponding squash operator. Next, we go on to investigate whether
the above restriction of &quot;rank two&quot; can be eliminated; i.e., is cyclic symmetry
alone sufficient to guarantee the existence of a squash operator? The
motivation behind this question is that, if this were true, it would imply that
one could realize a device-independent and unconditionally secure quantum key
distribution protocol. However, the answer turns out to be negative, and
moreover, one can instead prove a no-go theorem that any symmetry is, by
itself, insufficient to guarantee the existence of a squash operator.

Science. Rather than seeking to construct a simplified toy model, we aim for a
`big toy model', in which both quantum and classical systems can be faithfully
represented - as well as, possibly, more exotic kinds of systems.
  To this end, we show how Chu spaces can be used to represent physical systems
of various kinds. In particular, we show how quantum systems can be represented
as Chu spaces over the unit interval in such a way that the Chu morphisms
correspond exactly to the physically meaningful symmetries of the systems - the
unitaries and antiunitaries. In this way we obtain a full and faithful functor
from the groupoid of Hilbert spaces and their symmetries to Chu spaces. We also
consider whether it is possible to use a finite value set rather than the unit
interval; we show that three values suffice, while the two standard
possibilistic reductions to two values both fail to preserve fullness.

obscure, and their physical interpretation and their degree of generality is
presently unclear. In this paper, we show that all of the commonly-used

of some sort: either algebraically by generators and relations as in Jones'
original presentation, or as a diagram algebra modulo planar isotopy as in
Kauffman's presentation. We shall use tools from Geometry of Interaction, a
dynamical interpretation of proofs under Cut Elimination developed as an
off-shoot of Linear Logic, to give a direct description of the Temperley-Lieb
category -- a &quot;fully abstract presentation&quot;, in Computer Science terminology.
This also brings something new to the Geometry of Interaction, since we are led
to develop a planar version of it, and to verify that the interpretation of
Cut-Elimination (the &quot;Execution Formula&quot;, or &quot;composition by feedback&quot;)
preserves planarity.
  - We shall also show how the Temperley-Lieb algebra provides a natural
setting in which computation can be performed diagrammatically as geometric
simplification -- &quot;yanking lines straight&quot;. We shall introduce a &quot;planar
lambda-calculus&quot; for this purpose, and show how it can be interpreted in the
Temperley-Lieb category.

addition of two n-bit binary numbers with no ancillary qubits. The exact size
is 7n-6, which is smaller than that of any other quantum circuit ever
constructed for addition with no ancillary qubits. Using the circuit, we then
propose a method for constructing an O(d(n))-depth O(n)-size quantum circuit
for addition with O(n/d(n)) ancillary qubits for any d(n)=\Omega(log n). If we
are allowed to use unbounded fan-out gates with length O(n^c) for an arbitrary
small positive constant c, we can modify the method and construct an
O(e(n))-depth O(n)-size circuit with o(n) ancillary qubits for any
e(n)=\Omega(log* n). In particular, these methods yield efficient circuits with
depth O(log n) and with depth O(log* n), respectively. We apply our circuits to
constructing efficient quantum circuits for Shor's discrete logarithm

  space</title><description>  In this paper we provide a novel and general way to construct the result of
the action of any bosonic or fermionic operator represented in second quantized
form on a state vector, without resorting to the matrix representation of
operators and even to its elements. The new approach is based on our proposal
to compactly enumerate the configurations (i.e., determinants for fermions,
permanents for bosons) which are the elements of the state vector. This
extremely simplifies the calculation of the action of an operator on a state
vector. The computations of statical properties and of the evolution dynamics
of a system become much more efficient and applications to systems made of more
particles become feasible. Explicit formulations are given for spin-polarized
fermionic systems and spinless bosonic systems, as well as to general
(two-component) fermionic systems, two-component bosonic systems, and mixtures
thereof.

scheme in which time development of quantum states plays an essential role. Our

relation/property (FR/FP) meaning that the n-th level energy E_n is given
linearly, with real coefficients, by the two preceding ones E_{n-1}, E_{n-2}.
We first prove that the PDOs do not fall in the Fibonacci class. Then, three
different paths of generalizing the usual FP are developed for these
oscillators: we prove that the PDOs satisfy respective k-term generalized
Fibonacci (or &quot;k-bonacci&quot;) relations; for these same oscillators we examine two
other generalizations of the FR, the inhomogeneous FR and the &quot;quasi-Fibonacci&quot;
relation. Extended families of deformed oscillators are studied too: the
(q;\mu)-oscillator with \phi(n) quadratic in the basic q-number [n]_q is shown
to be Tribonacci one, while the (p,q;\mu)-oscillators with \phi(n) quadratic
(cubic) in the p,q-number [n]_{p,q} are proven to obey the Pentanacci
(Nine-bonacci) relations. Oscillators with general \phi(n), polynomial in
[n]_{q} or [n]_{p,q}, are also studied.

quantum teleportation implemented with entangled non-Gaussian resources. We
discuss in a unified framework the main decoherence mechanisms, including
imperfect Bell measurements and propagation of optical fields in lossy fibers,
applying the formalism of the characteristic function. By exploiting
appropriate displacement strategies, we compute analytically the success
probability of teleportation for input coherent states, and two classes of
non-Gaussian entangled resources: Two-mode squeezed Bell-like states (that
include as particular cases photon-added and photon-subtracted de-Gaussified
states), and two-mode squeezed cat-like states. We discuss the optimization
procedure on the free parameters of the non-Gaussian resources at fixed values
of the squeezing and of the experimental quantities determining the
inefficiencies of the non-ideal protocol. It is found that non-Gaussian
resources enhance significantly the efficiency of teleportation and are more
robust against decoherence than the corresponding Gaussian ones. Partial
information on the alphabet of input states allows further significant
improvement in the performance of the non-ideal teleportation protocol.

distributions correspond to quantum states. Quantum state space may thus be
thought of as a restricted subset of all potentially available probabilities. A
recent publication [1] advocates such a representation using symmetric
informationally complete (SIC) measurements. Building upon this work we study
how this subset--quantum-state space--might be characterized. Our leading
characteristic is that the inner products of the probabilities are bounded, a
simple condition with nontrivial consequences. To get quantum-state space
something more detailed about the extreme points is needed. No definitive

therefore, the degree of entanglement that is obtained for the overall chain of
N qubits. In particular, we work out the parameter regions for which the W

exponential in nature, obtaining the two-time second-order correlation function
is essentially claimed to be reduced to carrying out relatively simple

transferred to the density operator. Moreover, manipulation in reordering the
operators is performed by applying the usual trace operation. With all details,
it is basically observed that the two-time correlation can be readily

Since working with c-number equation is far more handy than the associated

Abelian anyonic walks demonstrate the expected quadratic quantum speedup.
Non-Abelian anyonic walks are much more subtle. The exponential increase of the

scaling in the steady-state energy spectrum as k-1 in small scales. Due to the
lack of dissipation, no evidence of the Kolmogorov-type forward energy cascade
in 3D or the inverse energy cascade in 2D is found, but the rotational and
potential flow components do approach equi-partition in the scaling regime. In
addition, the 3D vortex line-line correlation exhibits universal behaviour,
scaled as \Deltar^-2, where \Deltar is the separation between any two vortex
line elements, in fully developed turbulence. We also show that the quantum
vortex is not frozen to the matter, nor is the vortex motion induced by other
vortices via Biot-Savart's law. Thus, the quantum vortex is actually a
nonlinear wave, propagating at a speed very different from a classical vortex.

is studied. It is assumed that the scattering process does not destroy the
atomic wave function describing the state of the atom before the scattering
process takes place, but only induces a certain shift and change of its phase.
We find that the visibility of the interference strongly depends on the
statistical distribution of transferred momenta to the atom during the
photon-atom scattering event. This also explains the experimentally observed
(Chapman et al 1995 Phys. Rev. Lett. 75 2783) dependence of the visibility on
the ratio d_p/\lambda_i = y'_{12} (2\pi/kd\lambda_i), where y'_{12} is distance
between the place where the scattering event occurs and the first grating, k is
the wave number of the atomic center-of-mass motion, $d$ is the grating
constant and \lambda_i is the photon wavelength. Furthermore, it is remarkable
that photon-atom scattering events happen experimentally within the Fresnel
region, i.e. the near field region, associated with the first grating, which
should be taken into account when drawing conclusions about the relevance of

the analytic properties of this quantity as a function of n in some quantum
critical Ising-like models in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions. Although we find no true
singularities for n&gt;0, there is a threshold value of n close to 2 which
separates two very different `phases'. The region with larger n is
characterized by rapidly convergent Taylor expansions and is very smooth. The
region with smaller n has a very rich and varied structure in the complex n
plane and is characterized by Taylor coefficients which instead of being
monotone decreasing, have a maximum growing with the size of the subsystem.
Finite truncations of the Taylor expansion in this region lead to increasingly
poor approximations of $\tr\rho_A^n$. The computation of the entanglement
entropy from the knowledge of $\tr\rho^n_A$ for positive integer n becomes
extremely difficult particularly in spatial dimensions larger than one, where
one cannot use conformal field theory as a guidance in the extrapolations to

cryptography is that whenever a spy tries to eavesdrop the communication he
causes disturbances in the transmission of the message. Ultimately this
unavoidable disturbance is a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
that limits the joint knowledge of complementary observables. Now, a problem
remains: in order to initialize quantum key distribution, Alice and Bob need to
share a short shared key in order to be able to identify each other
unambiguously. Therefore a trusted courier is needed. We propose in this paper
a solution to the trusted courrier problem that was inspired by quantum
cryptography. The idea is to encode the key that Alice sends to Bob into
unstable nuclei in such a way that the message gets revealed only after the
courrier has delivered it to Bob. In this approach, we replace Heisenberg
uncertainties by another type of uncertainty, that characterizes the knowledge
of the time at which an unstable nucleus decays. As we shall show, this scheme
makes it possible to refresh a key even in the case that we do not trust the
courier who carries the key.

this article presents a unified framework for describing the set of possible

  nanomechanical resonators</title><description>  The observation of quantized nanomechanical oscillations by detecting
femtometer-scale displacements is a significant challenge for experimentalists.
We propose that phonon blockade can serve as a signature of quantum behavior in
nanomechanical resonators. In analogy to photon blockade and Coulomb blockade
for electrons, the main idea for phonon blockade is that the second phonon
cannot be excited when there is one phonon in the nonlinear oscillator. To
realize phonon blockade, a superconducting quantum two-level system is coupled
to the nanomechanical resonator and is used to induce the phonon
self-interaction. Using Monte Carlo simulations, the dynamics of the induced
nonlinear oscillator is studied via the Cahill-Glauber $s$-parametrized
quasiprobability distributions. We show how the oscillation of the resonator
can occur in the quantum regime and demonstrate how the phonon blockade can be
observed with currently accessible experimental parameters.

two inequivalent classes of genuine tripartite entanglement, namely the
GHZ-class and the W-class. Any two states within the same class can be
transformed into each other with stochastic local operations and classical
communication (SLOCC) with a non-zero probability. The optimal conversion
probability, however, is only known for special cases. Here, we derive new
lower and upper bounds for the optimal probability of transformation from a
GHZ-state to other states of the GHZ-class. A key idea in the derivation of the
upper bounds is to consider the action of the LOCC protocol on a different
input state, namely $1/\sqrt{2} [\ket{000} - \ket{111}]$, and demand that the
probability of an outcome remains bounded by 1. We also find an upper bound for
more general cases by using the constraints of the so-called interference term
and 3-tangle. Moreover, we generalize some of our results to the case where
each party holds a higher-dimensional system. In particular, we found that the
GHZ state generalized to three qutrits, i.e., $\ket{\mathrm{GHZ}_3} =
1/\sqrt{3} [ \ket{000} + \ket{111} + \ket{222} ] $, shared among three parties
can be transformed to {\it any} tripartite 3-qubit pure state with probability
1 via LOCC. Some of our results can also be generalized to the case of a
multipartite state shared by more than three parties.

operators are applied to the design of quantum adiabatic algorithms. The
conventional, standard adiabatic quantum computation proceeds along
eigenenergies of parameter-dependent Hamiltonians. By contrast, discrete
adiabatic computation utilizes adiabatic passage along the quasienergies of
parameter-dependent unitary operators. For example, such computation can be
realized by a concatenation of parameterized quantum circuits, with an
adiabatic though inevitably discrete change of the parameter. A design
principle of adiabatic passage along quasienergy is recently proposed: Cheon's
quasienergy and eigenspace anholonomies on unitary operators is available to
realize anholonomic adiabatic algorithms [Tanaka and Miyamoto, Phys. Rev. Lett.
98, 160407 (2007)], which compose a nontrivial family of discrete adiabatic
algorithms. It is straightforward to port a standard adiabatic algorithm to an
anholonomic adiabatic one, except an introduction of a parameter |v&gt;, which is
available to adjust the gaps of the quasienergies to control the running time
steps. In Grover's database search problem, the costs to prepare |v&gt; for the
qualitatively different, i.e., power or exponential, running time steps are
shown to be qualitatively different. Curiously, in establishing the equivalence
between the standard quantum computation based on the circuit model and the
anholonomic adiabatic quantum computation model, it is shown that the cost for
|v&gt; to enlarge the gaps of the eigenvalue is qualitatively negligible.

Superconductivity in these loops is carried by $\sim 10^6$ -- $10^{10}$

that the number of microscopic constituents participating in superposition

result from the Fermi statistics of the electrons and the large disparity

  using coherent light and squeezed vacuum</title><description>  Two path interferometry with coherent states and squeezed vacuum can achieve
phase sensitivities close to the Heisenberg limit when the average photon
number of the squeezed vacuum is close to the average photon number of the
coherent light. Here, we investigate the phase sensitivity of such states in
the presence of photon losses. It is shown that the Cramer-Rao bound of phase
sensitivity can be achieved experimentally by using a weak local oscillator and
photon counting in the output. The phase sensitivity is then given by the
Fisher information F of the state. In the limit of high squeezing, the ratio
(F-N)/N^2 of Fisher information above shot noise to the square of the average
photon number N depends only on the average number of photons lost, n_loss, and
the fraction of squeezed vacuum photons mu. For mu=1/2, the effect of losses is
given by (F-N)/N^2=1/(1+2 n_loss). The possibility of increasing the robustness
against losses by lowering the squeezing fraction mu is considered and an
optimized result is derived. However, the improvements are rather small, with a
maximal improvement by a factor of two at high losses.

These information-theoretic measures of the associated Rakhmanov probability
density, which are direct measures of the polynomial spreading in the sense of
having the same units as the variable, share interesting properties: invariance
under translations and reflections, linear scaling and vanishing in the limit
that the variable tends towards a given definite value. The expressions of the
Renyi and Fisher lengths for the Hermite polynomials are computed in terms of
the polynomial degree. The combinatorial multivariable Bell polynomials, which
are shown to characterize the finite power of an arbitrary polynomial, play a
relevant role for the computation of these information-theoretic lengths.
Indeed these polynomials allow us to design an error-free computing approach
for the entropic moments (weighted L^q-norms) of Hermite polynomials and
subsequently for the Renyi and Tsallis entropies, as well as for the Renyi
spreading lengths. Sharp bounds for the Shannon length of these polynomials are
also given by means of an information-theoretic-based optimization procedure.
Moreover, it is computationally proved the existence of a linear correlation
between the Shannon length (as well as the second-order Renyi length) and the
standard deviation. Finally, the application to the most popular

some relevant asymptotical open issues related to the entropic moments

(T3) the orthogonality and isolation of the different branches of the state
vector. These three imply the particle-like properties of mass, energy,
momentum, spin, charge, and locality are actually properties of the state
vector; and this in turn implies there is no evidence for the existence of
particles. Experimentally there is no evidence for collapse (E1) and
theoretically linearity prohibits collapse. One also has the experimentally
verified probability law (E2), which is found to rule out the many-worlds
interpretation. The failure of these three major interpretation, particles,
collapse, and many-worlds, apparently implies an acceptable interpretation must
be based on perception. Rather than being a separate principle, probability
follows in this interpretation from a weak assumption on perception plus the
combinatorics when an experiment is run many times. This suggests a relatively
simple experimental test of the perception interpretation.

captured, and provide mathematical tools such as final coalgebras, bisimulation
and coalgebraic logic. However, the standard coalgebraic framework does not
accommodate contravariance, and is too rigid to allow physical symmetries to be

contravariance is represented by indexing. We use this structure to give a
universal semantics for quantum systems based on a final coalgebra
construction. We characterize equality in this semantics as projective
equivalence. We also define an analogous indexed structure for Chu spaces, and
use this to obtain a novel categorical description of the category of Chu

reversible discrete-time dynamics, it is intuitive that as much &quot;quantum
information&quot; as moves into any given block of cells from the left, has to exit
that block to the right. For two types of such systems - namely quantum walks
and cellular automata - we make this intuition precise by defining an index, a
quantity that measures the &quot;net flow of quantum information&quot; through the
system. The index supplies a complete characterization of two properties of the
discrete dynamics. First, two systems S_1, S_2 can be pieced together, in the
sense that there is a system S which locally acts like S_1 in one region and
like S_2 in some other region, if and only if S_1 and S_2 have the same index.
Second, the index labels connected components of such systems: equality of the
index is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a continuous deformation
of S_1 into S_2. In the case of quantum walks, the index is integer-valued,
whereas for cellular automata, it takes values in the group of positive
rationals. In both cases, the map S -&gt; ind S is a group homomorphism if
composition of the discrete dynamics is taken as the group law of the quantum
systems. Systems with trivial index are precisely those which can be realized
by partitioned unitaries, and the prototypes of systems with non-trivial index
are shifts.

This is done by relating the problem of detecting when a channel is close to an

  Quantum Aspects</title><description>  We extend the framework of Nambu-Hamiltonian Mechanics to include dissipation
in $R^{3}$ phase space. We demonstrate that it accommodates the phase space
dynamics of low dimensional dissipative systems such as the much studied Lorenz
and R\&quot;{o}ssler Strange attractors, as well as the more recent constructions of
Chen and Leipnik-Newton. The rotational, volume preserving part of the flow
preserves in time a family of two intersecting surfaces, the so called {\em
Nambu Hamiltonians}. They foliate the entire phase space and are, in turn,
deformed in time by Dissipation which represents their irrotational part of the
flow. It is given by the gradient of a scalar function and is responsible for
the emergence of the Strange Attractors.
  Based on our recent work on Quantum Nambu Mechanics, we provide an explicit
quantization of the Lorenz attractor through the introduction of
Non-commutative phase space coordinates as Hermitian $ N \times N $ matrices in
$ R^{3}$. They satisfy the commutation relations induced by one of the two
Nambu Hamiltonians, the second one generating a unique time evolution.
Dissipation is incorporated quantum mechanically in a self-consistent way
having the correct classical limit without the introduction of external degrees
of freedom. Due to its volume phase space contraction it violates the quantum
commutation relations. We demonstrate that the Heisenberg-Nambu evolution
equations for the Quantum Lorenz system give rise to an attracting ellipsoid in
the $3 N^{2}$ dimensional phase space.

left-right isomerism is viewed in terms of a double-bottomed harmonic potential
well. The active molecule is assumed to be embedded in a gas, liquid or solid,
submitted to a perturbing potential U created by the molecules of the sample.
In our model we take into account the difference of energy E due to the weak
interactions between the left (L) and right (R) configurations. We have shown
that when E is equal to zero the system cannot be optically stable: the optical
activity tends asymptotically to zero in the case of dilute gases or compressed
gases and liquids or oscillates periodically around zero when the molecules are
isolated or submitted to a static potential. Only when E is different of zero
the system can be optically stable depending on the strength parameters of the
potential U and on the magnitude of the spontaneous tunneling.

purely dissipative effect disappears if the frequencies are different because
of the &quot;ergodic average&quot; used by this approach. However, there are physical
situations where this technique is too rough to capture all the relevant

existing protocols is low as two-way classical communication is used. We show
that, if Bell pairs are generated between neighboring stations with a
probability of heralded success greater than 0.65 and fidelity greater than
0.96, two-way classical communication can be entirely avoided and quantum
information can be sent over arbitrary distances with arbitrarily low error at
a rate limited only by the local gate speed. The number of qubits per repeater
scales logarithmically with the communication distance. If the probability of
heralded success is less than 0.65 and Bell pairs between neighboring stations
with fidelity no less than 0.92 are generated only every T_B seconds, the
logarithmic resource scaling remains and the communication rate through N links
is proportional to 1/(T_B log^2 N).

by O(1/d). Second, we show that the state is highly entangled in the sense that
a large number of ebits are needed in order to create the state: entanglement

a single parameter (supercircular exponent or exponent) semi-empirical formula,

put to test by comparing the obtained eigenvalues for several low lying states
with their corresponding numerical estimates. It is seen that the formula gives

quantum communication with continuous polarization variables. In our
prepare-and-measure setup, coherent polarization states are transmitted through
an atmospheric quantum channel of 100m length on the roof of our institute's
building. The signal states are measured by homodyne detection with the help of
a local oscillator (LO) which propagates in the same spatial mode as the
signal, orthogonally polarized to it. Thus the interference of signal and LO is
excellent and atmospheric fluctuations are autocompensated. The LO also acts as
spatial and spectral filter, which allows for unrestrained daylight operation.
Important characteristics for our system are atmospheric channel influences
that could cause polarization, intensity and position excess noise. Therefore
we study these influences in detail. Our results indicate that the channel is
suitable for our quantum communication system in most weather conditions.

splitter, the EBS can directly split a photon-spin product state into two
constituent entangled states via transmission and reflection with high fidelity
and high efficiency (up to 100 percent). This device is based on giant optical
circular birefringence induced by a single spin as a result of cavity quantum
electrodynamics and the spin selection rule of trion transition (Pauli
blocking). The EBS is robust and it is immune to the fine structure splitting
in a realistic quantum dot. This quantum device can be used for
deterministically creating photon-spin, photon-photon and spin-spin
entanglement as well as a single-shot quantum non-demolition measurement of a
single spin. Therefore, the EBS can find wide applications in quantum

dynamics, which reduces the problem to one of parameter estimation. This allows
part of the problem to be tackled using efficient convex methods, which, when
coupled with a constraint on some parameters allows globally optimal estimates
for the Kraus operators to be determined from experimental data. Parameterising
the maps provides further advantages: it allows the incorporation of mixed
states of the environment as well as some initial correlation between the
system and environment, both of which are common physical situations following
excitation of the system away from thermal equilibrium. Although the approach
is not universal, in cases where it is valid it returns a complete set of
positive maps for the dynamical evolution of a quantum system at all times.

the partial trace to one of the component spaces of the total Hilbert space,
then all one particle states are identical. The particles are
indistinguishable. This is often thought to be a typical quantum mechanical
phenomenon. I will show however that an analogous procedure to define particle
states exists in classical mechanics, which results in classical
indistinguishable identical particles. From this analogy it follows that the
indistinguishability of identical particles depends on how we define particle
states. It is not an inevitable result of the symmetry postulate.
  Indeed, if particles are defined by partial traces, consistent use of the
symmetry postulate leads to the conclusion that all identical particles in the
universe are indistinguishable, so that particles can never be pointed at, not
even in the classical limit. This does not correspond to the way the term
particle is actually used in practice. I will argue that a particle should be
defined in such a way that in the classical limit the quantum particle state
becomes the state of a classical particle. This will lead us to a definition of
particles which is in line with the way the term particle is actually used by
physicists.

complexity of optimizing quantum mechanical control systems. The study is based
on a topology analysis of the corresponding quantum control landscape, which is
referred to as the optimization objective as a functional of control fields. We
find that the degree of controllability is closely relevant with the ruggedness
of the landscape, which determines the search efficiency for global optima.
This effect is demonstrated via the gate fidelity control landscape of a system
whose controllability is restricted on a SU(2) dynamic symmetry group. We show
that multiple local false traps (i.e., non-global suboptima) exist even if the
target gate is realizable and that the number of these traps is increased by
the loss of controllability, while the controllable systems are always devoid
of false traps.

  First, we show that there exists an oracle relation problem (i.e., a problem

yields a non-oracle relation problem that is solvable in quantum logarithmic

  Second, we show that an oracle decision problem separating BQP from PH would
follow from the Generalized Linial-Nisan Conjecture, which we formulate here

system of a free electron interacting with a quantized mode of the
electromagnetic radiation. Wave packets of the dressed states so obtained are
constructed in order to describe the spatio-temporal separation of the
subsystems before and after the interaction. The joint probability amplitudes
are calculated for the detection of the electron at some space-time location

time evolution of entanglement between the initially separated electron wave
packet and the radiation mode leads to the conclusion that in general there are
non-vanishing entropy remnants in the subsystems after the interaction. On the
basis of the simple model to be presented here, the calculated values of the
entropy remnants crucially depend on the character of the switching-on and off

example of this phenomenon is the measurement process, in which the wave
function of the laboratory (quantum system + apparatus + environment)
decomposes into n parts, corresponding to the n outcomes of the measurement:
the parts are non-overlapping, because they represent a macroscopic pointer in
different positions, and they are permanently non-overlapping due to the
irreversible interaction with the environment. PSD is often mentioned in the
literature, but until now no formal definition or systematic study of this
phenomenon has been undertaken. The aim of this paper is to partially fill this

have novel structures such that they are inverted-bell shaped and the supports
of them are bounded. In the present paper we claim that these properties of the
SQW$^{(d)}$ can be explained by the theory of relativistic quantum mechanics.
We show that the Dirac equation with a proper ultraviolet cutoff can provide a
quantum walk model in three dimensions, where the walker has a four-component
qubit. We clarify that the pseudovelocity $\V(t)$ of the quantum walker, which
solves the Dirac equation, is identified with the relativistic velocity. Since
the quantum walker should be a tardyon, not a tachyon, $|\V(t)| &lt; c$, where $c$
is the speed of light, and this restriction (the causality) is the origin of
the finiteness of supports of the limit distributions universally found in
quantum walk models. By reducing the number of components of momentum in the
Dirac equation, we obtain the limit distributions of pseudovelocities for the
lower dimensional quantum walks. We show that the obtained limit distributions
for the one- and two-dimensional systems have the common features with those of
SQW$^{(1)}$ and SQW$^{(2)}$.

challenges of both basic and applied science. The complexity of interparticle
interaction and environment coupling increases rapidly with the number of
to-be-entangled subsystems, rendering the requirements on the control of
many-body quantum systems ever more restrictive. We propose an approach that
allows to derive optimal control Hamiltonians in a purely algebraic fashion.
These drive a composite quantum system rapidly into that highly entangled state
which can be created most efficiently for a given interaction mechanism, and
which bears entanglement that is robust against decoherence.

first order Correlation Functions (CF) in the fluorescence fields, as a very

metal half spaces; here both in the form of the torsion pendulum experiment by
Lamoreaux and in the form of the Casimir pressure measurement between a gold
sphere and a gold plate as performed by Decca et al.; theory predicts a large

third experiment is the measurement of the Casimir force between a metal plate

dissipative quantum system. Optimal control using Pontryagin maximum principle
is specifically derived. The influences of Ohmic reservoir with Lorentz-Drude
regularization are numerically studied in a two-level system under the
following three conditions: \omega_0\ll\omega_c, \omega_0\approx\omega_c or
\omega_0\gg\omega_c, where \omega_0 is the characteristic frequency of the
quantum system of interest, and \omega_c the cut-off frequency of Ohmic
reservoir. The optimal control process shows its remarkable influences on the
decoherence dynamics. The temperature is a key factor in the decoherence
dynamics. We analyze the optimal decoherence control in high temperature,
intermediate temperature, and low temperature reservoirs respectively. It
implies that designing some engineered reservoirs with the controlled coupling
and state of the environment can slow down the decoherence rate and delay the
decoherence time. Moreover, we compare the non-Markovian optimal decoherence
control with the Markovian one and find that with non-Markovian the engineered
artificial reservoirs are better than with the Markovian approximation in
controlling the open, dissipative quantum system's decoherence.

which provably finds a good approximation of the ground state of 1D systems

Product State of bond dimension $D$ whose energy approximates the minimal
energy such states can achieve. The running time is exponential in D, and so
the algorithm can be considered tractable even for D which is logarithmic in
the size of the chain. The result also implies trivially that the ground state
of any local commuting Hamiltonian in 1D can be approximated efficiently; we
improve this to an exact algorithm.

often decoherence may equally well be described by random unitary dynamics
without invoking a quantum environment at all. For a single qubit, for
instance, pure decoherence (or phase damping) is always of random unitary type.
Here, we construct a simple example of true quantum decoherence of two qubits:
we present a feasible phase damping channel of which we show that it cannot be

geometrical measure for the positive distance of our channel to the convex set
of random unitary channels and find remarkable agreement with the so-called

circular photon polarizations. To account for the measurement of the photons as
well as dephasing effects, we choose a stochastic Schroedinger equation and a

the classical deterministic Newtonian world. We argue that in fact the Newton
determinism in classical world does not hold and in classical mechanics there
is fundamental and irreducible randomness. The classical Newtonian trajectory
does not have a direct physical meaning since arbitrary real numbers are not
observable. There are classical uncertainty relations, i.e. the uncertainty
(errors of observation) in the determination of coordinate and momentum is
always positive (non zero).
  A &quot;functional&quot; formulation of classical mechanics was suggested. The
fundamental equation of the microscopic dynamics in the functional approach is
not the Newton equation but the Liouville equation for the distribution
function of the single particle. Solutions of the Liouville equation have the
property of delocalization which accounts for irreversibility. The Newton
equation in this approach appears as an approximate equation describing the
dynamics of the average values of the position and momenta for not too long
time intervals. Corrections to the Newton trajectories are computed. An
interpretation of quantum mechanics is attempted in which both classical and
quantum mechanics contain fundamental randomness. Instead of an ensemble of
events one introduces an ensemble of observers.

localized Wannier functions. We show that such obstructions are $K$-theoretic
obstructions to approximating almost commuting, complex-valued matrices by
commuting matrices, and we demonstrate numerically the presence of this
obstruction for a lattice model of the quantum Hall effect in a spherical
geometry. The numerical calculation of the obstruction is straightforward, and
does not require translational invariance or introducing a flux torus.
  We further show that there is a $Z_2$ index obstruction to approximating
almost commuting self-dual matrices by exactly commuting self-dual matrices,
and present additional conjectures regarding the approximation of almost
commuting real and self-dual matrices by exactly commuting real and self-dual
matrices. The motivation for considering this problem is the case of physical
systems with additional antiunitary symmetries such as time reversal or
particle-hole conjugation.
  Finally, in the case of the sphere--mathematically speaking three almost

first quantitative result showing this index is the only obstruction to finding
commuting approximations. We review the known non-quantitative results for the

of a single photon, to investigate entanglement generation by a common
environment. The two qubits are represented by the photon polarization and
Hermite-Gauss transverse modes, while the environment corresponds to the photon
path. For an initially two-qubit separable state, the increase of entanglement
is analyzed, as the probability of an environment-induced transition ranges
from zero to one. An entanglement witness that is invariant throughout the
evolution of the system yields a direct measurement of the concurrence of the

that assignment maps can be made linear at the expense of positivity or

computation theory (t-QCT), where the computation time is defined by the
physical one and the Hamiltonian contains only one- and two-qubit interactions.
This version of t-QCT is also considered as optimality by sub-Riemannian
geodesic length. The work has two aims: one is to develop a t-QCT itself based
on physically natural concept of time, and the other is to pursue the
possibility of using t-QCT as a tool to estimate the complexity in conventional
gate-optimal quantum computation theory (g-QCT). In particular, we investigate
to what extent is true the statement: time complexity is polynomial in the
number of qubits if and only if so is gate complexity. In the analysis, we
relate t-QCT and optimal control theory (OCT) through fidelity-optimal
computation theory (f-QCT); f-QCT is equivalent to t-QCT in the limit of unit
optimal fidelity, while it is formally similar to OCT. We then develop an
efficient numerical scheme for f-QCT by modifying Krotov's method in OCT, which
has monotonic convergence property. We implemented the scheme and obtained
solutions of f-QCT and of t-QCT for the quantum Fourier transform and a unitary
operator that does not have an apparent symmetry. The former has a polynomial
gate complexity and the latter is expected to have exponential one because a
series of generic unitary operators has a exponential gate complexity. The time
complexity for the former is found to be linear in the number of qubits, which
is understood naturally by the existence of an upper bound. The time complexity
for the latter is exponential. Thus the both targets are examples satisfyng the
statement above. The typical characteristics of the optimal Hamiltonians are
symmetry under time-reversal and constancy of one-qubit operation, which are
mathematically shown to hold in fairly general situations.

their interplay plays a crucial role in preserving the entanglement in the
steady state. When the non-Markovian effect is neglected, the entanglement
sudden death (ESD) is reproduced. On the other hand, when the non-Markovian is
significantly strong but the bound state is absent, the phenomenon of the ESD

channels. In particular, we focus on the entanglement dynamics as a function of
the initial states and the channel parameters like the temperature and the
ratio $r$ between $\omega_0$ the characteristic frequency of the quantum system
of interest, and $\omega_c$ the cut-off frequency of Ohmic reservoir. We give a
stationary analysis of the concurrence and find that the dynamic of
non-markovian entanglement concurrence $\mathcal{C}_{\rho}(t)$ at temperature
$k_BT=0$ is different from the $k_BT&gt;0$ case. We find that &quot;entanglement sudden
death&quot; (ESD) depends on the initial state when $k_BT=0$, otherwise the
concurrence always disappear at finite time when $k_BT&gt;0$, which means that ESD
must happen. The main result of this paper is that the non-Markovian
entanglement dynamic is fundamentally different from the Markovian one. In the
Markovian channel, entanglement decays exponentially and vanishes only
asymptotically, but in the non-Markovian channel the concurrence
$\mathcal{C}_{\rho}(t)$ oscillates, especially in the high temperature case.
Then an open-loop controller adjusted by the temperature is proposed to control
the entanglement and prolong the ESD time.

  Rope Tricks</title><description>  Using the cubic honeycomb (cubic tessellation) of Euclidean 3-space, we
define a quantum system whose states, called quantum knots, represent a closed
knotted piece of rope, i.e., represent the particular spatial configuration of
a knot tied in a rope in 3-space. This quantum system, called a quantum knot
system, is physically implementable in the same sense as Shor's quantum
factoring algorithm is implementable.
  To define a quantum knot system, we replace the standard three Reidemeister
knot moves with an equivalent set of three moves, called respectively wiggle,
wag, and tug, so named because they mimic how a dog might wag its tail. We
argue that these moves are in fact more &quot;physics friendly&quot; because, unlike the
Reidemeister moves, they respect the differential geometry of 3-space, and
moreover they can be transformed into infinitesimal moves.
  These three moves wiggle, wag, and tug generate a unitary group, called the
lattice ambient group, which acts on the state space of the quantum system. The
lattice ambient group represents all possible ways of moving a rope around in
3-space without cutting the rope, and without letting the rope pass through
itself.
  We then investigate those quantum observables of the quantum knot system
which are knot invariants. We also study Hamiltonians associated with the
generators of the lattice ambient group. We conclude with a list of open
questions.

  temperature</title><description>  The problem of infrared divergence of the effective electromagnetic field at
finite temperature (T) is revisited. A model of single spatially localized
electron interacting with thermal photons is considered in the limit T to 0
using two different regularization schemes. The first is based on the shift i 0
to i varepsilon of the electron propagator pole in the complex energy plane,
and is used to explicitly calculate the effective field in the one-loop
approximation. We show that the matrix-valued imaginary part of the electron
self-energy can be consistently related to the pole shift, and that the
presence of the heat bath leads to appearance of an effective varepsilon sim T,
thus providing a natural infrared regulator of the theory. We find that the
one-loop effective Coulomb field calculated using this varepsilon vanishes. The
other scheme combines an infrared momentum cutoff with smearing of the
delta-functions in the interaction vertices. We prove that this regularization
admits factorization of the infrared contributions in multi-loop diagrams, and
sum the corresponding infinite series. The effective electromagnetic field is
found to vanish in this case too. An essentially perturbative nature of this
result is emphasized and discussed in connection with the long-range expansion
of the effective field.

entanglement concentration at the Shannon bound. Alice and Bob begin with N
identical (but unknown) two-qubit pure states, each containing E ebits of
entanglement. They each run a reversible algorithm on their qubits, and end up
with Y perfect EPR pairs, where Y = NE +- O(\sqrt N). Our protocol is
streaming, so the N input systems are fed in one at a time, and perfect EPR
pairs start popping out almost immediately. It matches the optimal block
protocol exactly at each stage, so the average yield after n inputs is &lt;Y&gt; = nE
- O(log n). So, somewhat surprisingly, there is no tradeoff between yield and
lag -- our protocol optimizes both. In contrast, the optimal N-qubit block
protocol achieves the same yield, but since no EPR pairs are produced until the
entire input block is read, its lag is O(N). Finally, our algorithm runs in
O(log N) space, so a lot of entanglement can be efficiently concentrated using
a very small (e.g., current or near-future technology) quantum processor. Along
the way, we find an optimal streaming protocol for extracting randomness from
classical i.i.d. sources and a more space-efficient implementation of the Schur

quantum entanglement between the detectors can be created by the quantum field

other's light cone in this setup. In the weak coupling limit, this entanglement
creation can occur only if the initial moment is placed early enough and the
proper acceleration of the detectors is not too large or too small compared to
the natural frequency of the detectors. Once entanglement is created it lasts
only a finite duration, and always disappears at late times. Prior result by
Reznik derived using the time-dependent perturbation theory with extended

vacuum fluctuations experienced by each detector locally always dominate over
the cross correlations between the detectors, so entanglement between the

ordinary pump photon down-conversion to either extraordinary signal and
ordinary idler paired photons, or to ordinary signal and extraordinary idler
paired photons. In contrast to single type-II phase-matching, these two
processes, when enabled together, can lead to the direct production of
cross-polarization-entangled state for non degenerate signal and idler
wavelengths. Such a scheme should be of great interest in applications
requiring polarization-entangled non degenerate paired photons with, for

Then, we focus on large rates of decoherence and calculate the probability

This shows that the mixing time decreases with increasing the range of

thermodynamic entropy and that individual eigenstates possess thermodynamic
characteristics analogous to those of generic isolated systems. We examine
large systems with eigenstate energies equivalent to finite temperatures. When
quasi-static evolution of a system is adiabatic (in the quantum mechanical
sense), two coupled subsystems can transfer heat from one subsystem to another
yet remain in an energy eigenstate. To explicitly construct the entropy from
the wave function, degrees of freedom are divided into two unequal parts. It is
argued that the entanglement entropy between these two subsystems is the
thermodynamic entropy per degree of freedom for the smaller subsystem. This is
done by tracing over the larger subsystem to obtain a density matrix, and
calculating the diagonal and off-diagonal contributions to the entanglement
entropy.

succeeded in providing ever more and refined explanations of macroscopic
phenomena that were based on an improved understanding of molecular structures
and mechanisms. Simultaneously, quantum physics, originally rooted in a world
view of quantum coherences, entanglement and other non-classical effects, has
been heading towards systems of increasing complexity. The present perspective
article shall serve as a pedestrian guide to the growing interconnections
between the two fields. We recapitulate the generic and sometimes unintuitive

One
of the main questions in this area is the \emph{parallel repetition question}:
If the game is played $\ell$ times in parallel, does the maximum winning
probability decay exponentially in $\ell$? In the classical setting, this
question was answered in the affirmative by Raz. More recently the question
arose whether the decay is of the form $(1-\Theta(\eps))^\ell$ where $1-\eps$
is the value of the game and $\ell$ is the number of repetitions. This question
is known as the \emph{strong parallel repetition question} and was motivated by
its connections to the unique games conjecture. It was resolved by Raz who
showed that strong parallel repetition does \emph{not} hold, even in the very
special case of games known as XOR games.
  This opens the question whether strong parallel repetition holds in the case
when the provers share entanglement. Evidence for this is provided by the
behavior of XOR games, which have strong (in fact \emph{perfect}) parallel
repetition, and by the recently proved strong parallel repetition of linear
unique games. A similar question was open for games with so-called
non-signaling provers. Here the best known parallel repetition theorem is due
to Holenstein, and is of the form $(1-\Theta(\eps^2))^\ell$.
  We show that strong parallel repetition holds neither with entangled provers
nor with non-signaling provers. In particular we obtain that Holenstein's bound
is tight. Along the way we also provide a tight characterization of the
asymptotic behavior of the entangled value under parallel repetition of unique
games in terms of a semidefinite program.

Part of our work is to justify why the definitions and results we describe here
are natural generalizations of the classical concepts of Thermodynamic
Formalism (in the sense of R. Bowen, Y. Sinai and D. Ruelle). It is well-known
that the concept of density operator should replace the concept of measure for
the cases in which we consider a quantum formalism. We consider the operator
$\Lambda$ acting on the space of density matrices $\mathcal{M}_N$ over a finite
$N$-dimensional complex Hilbert space $$ \Lambda(\rho):=\sum_{i=1}^k tr(W_i\rho
W_i^*)\frac{V_i\rho V_i^*}{tr(V_i\rho V_i^*)}, $$ where $W_i$ and $V_i$,
$i=1,2,..., k$ are linear operators in this Hilbert space. In some sense this
operator is a version of an Iterated Function System (IFS). Namely, the
$V_i\,(.)\,V_i^*=:F_i(.)$, $i=1,2,...,k$, play the role of the inverse branches
(i.e., the dynamics on the configuration space of density matrices) and the
$W_i$ play the role of the weights one can consider on the IFS. In this way a
family $W:=\{W_i\}_{i=1,..., k}$ determines a Quantum Iterated Function System
(QIFS). We also present some estimates related to the Holevo bound.

since the last decade. This topic is very close to potential applications to
the so called Quantum Computer. In our point of view it makes sense to develop
a more &quot;dynamical point of view&quot; of this theory. We want to consider the
concepts of entropy and pressure for &quot;stationary systems&quot; acting on density
matrices which generalize the usual ones in Ergodic Theory (in the sense of the
Thermodynamic Formalism of R. Bowen, Y. Sinai and D. Ruelle). We consider the
operator $\mathcal{L}$ acting on density matrices $\rho\in \mathcal{M}_N$ over
a finite $N$-dimensional complex Hilbert space $\mathcal{L}(\rho):=\sum_{i=1}^k
tr(W_i\rho W_i^*)V_i\rho V_i^*,$ where $W_i$ and $V_i$, $i=1,2,... k$ are
operators in this Hilbert space. $\mathcal{L}$ is not a linear operator. In
some sense this operator is a version of an Iterated Function System (IFS).
Namely, the $V_i (.) V_i^*=:F_i(.)$, $i=1,2,...,k$, play the role of the
inverse branches (acting on the configuration space of density matrices $\rho$)
and the $W_i$ play the role of the weights one can consider on the IFS. We also
analyze the discrete Wigner function.
  We suppose that for all $\rho$ we have that $\sum_{i=1}^k tr(W_i\rho
W_i^*)=1$. A family $W:=\{W_i\}_{i=1,..., k}$ determines a Quantum Iterated

  presence of electric currents</title><description>  We discuss the dynamics of a classical spinless quantum particle carrying
electric charge and constrained to move on a non singular static surface in
ordinary three dimensional space in the presence of arbitrary configurations of
time independent electric currents. Starting from the canonical action in the
embedding space we show that a charged particle with charge $q$ couples to a
term linear in $qA^3M$, where $A^3$ is the transverse component of the
electromagnetic vector potential and $M$ is the mean curvature in the surface.
This term cancels exactly a curvature contribution to the orbital magnetic
moment of the particle. It is shown that particles, independently of the value
of the charge, in addition to the known couplings to the geometry also couple
to the mean curvature in the surface when a Neumann type of constraint is
applied on the transverse fluctuations of the wave function. In contrast to a
Dirrichlet constraint on the transverse fluctuations a Neumann type of
constraint on these degrees of freedom will in general make the equations of
motion non separable. The exceptions are the equations of motion for
electrically neutral particles on surfaces with constant mean curvature. In the
presence of electric currents the equation of motion of a charged particle is
generally non separable independently of the coupling to the geometry and the
boundary constraints.

with quantum gases,&quot; where a quantum description of both light and atomic
motion is equally important. Due to the dynamical entanglement of atomic motion
and light, the measurement of light affects the many-body atomic state as well.
The conditional atomic dynamics can be described using the Quantum Monte Carlo
Wave Function Simulation method. In this paper, we emphasize how this usually
complicated numerical procedure can be reduced to an analytical solution after
some assumptions and approximations valid for macroscopic Bose-Einstein
condensates (BEC) with large atom numbers. The theory can be applied for
lattices with both low filling factors (e.g. one atom per lattice site in
average) and very high filling factors (e.g. a BEC in a double-well potential).
The purity of the resulting multipartite entangled atomic state is analyzed.

as well as to precisely measure both the resonator's frequency and the

limited by the coherence time. If the relaxation time of the resonator were to

entangled polarization state. A birefringent double-slit is illuminated by one
of the down-converted photons, and it acts as a single-photon two-qubits
controlled not gate that couples the polarization with the transversal momentum
of these photons. The other photon, that acts as a which-path marker, is sent
through a Mach-Zehnder-like interferometer. When the interferometer is
partially unbalanced, it behaves as a controlled source of decoherence for
polarization states of down-converted photons. We show the transition from
wave-like to particle-like behavior of the signal photons crossing the
double-slit as a function of the decoherence parameter, which depends on the
length path difference at the interferometer.

simple, comprehensible physical principles from which the theory can be
uniquely derived. A broad class of probabilistic theories exist which all share
some features with quantum theory, such as probabilistic predictions for
individual outcomes (indeterminism), the impossibility of information transfer
faster than speed of light (no-signaling) or the impossibility of copying of
unknown states (no-cloning). A vast majority of attempts to find physical
principles behind quantum theory either fall short of deriving the theory
uniquely from the principles or are based on abstract mathematical assumptions
that require themselves a more conclusive physical motivation. Here, we show
that classical probability theory and quantum theory can be reconstructed from
three reasonable axioms: (1) (Information capacity) All systems with
information carrying capacity of one bit are equivalent. (2) (Locality) The
state of a composite system is completely determined by measurements on its
subsystems. (3) (Reversibility) Between any two pure states there exists a
reversible transformation. If one requires the transformation from the last
axiom to be continuous, one separates quantum theory from the classical
probabilistic one. A remarkable result following from our reconstruction is
that no probability theory other than quantum theory can exhibit entanglement
without contradicting one or more axioms.

FC-QKD optical fiber system under the low modulation index regime is presented
which accounts for all the possible tandem combinations. The properties and the
parameter selection of the modulators to achieve each one are summarized. We
also address which protocol (B92, BB84 or either) is feasible to be implemented
with each configuration. The results confirm those reported for the
configurations previously reported in the literature and, at the same time,
show the existence of four novel tandem modulator configurations that can also
be employed. We have also provided experimental evidence of the successful
operation of the novel configurations that confirm the behavior predicted by
the theoretical results.

  Entanglements</title><description>  Braiding operators corresponding to the third Reidemeister move in the theory
of knots and links are realized in terms of parametrized unitary matrices for
all dimensions. Two distinct classes are considered. Their (non-local) unitary
actions on separable pure product states of three identical subsystems (say,
the spin projections of three particles) are explicitly evaluated for all
dimensions. This, for our classes, is shown to generate entangled superposition
of four terms in the base space. The 3-body and 2-body entanglements (in three
2-body subsystems), the 3-tangles and 2-tangles are explicitly evaluated for
each class. For our matrices, these are parametrized. Varying parameters they
can be made to sweep over the domain (0,1).Thus braiding operators
corresponding to over- and under-crossings of three braids and, on closing
ends, to topologically entangled Borromean rings are shown, in another context,
to generate quantum entanglements. For higher dimensions, starting with
different initial triplets one can entangle by turns, each state with all the
rest. A specific coupling of three angular momenta is briefly discussed to
throw more light on three body entanglements.

computational abilities of quantum systems and the Church-Turing Thesis role in
Physics. We propose here the idea of geometry of effective physical process as
the essentially physical notion of computation. In Quantum mechanics we cannot
use the traditional Euclidean geometry but we introduce more sophisticate non
Euclidean geometry which include a new kind of information diffuse in the
entire universe and that we can represent as Fisher information or active
information. We remark that from the Fisher information we can obtain the Bohm
and Hiley quantum potential and the classical Schrodinger equation. We can see
the quantum phenomena do not affect a limited region of the space but is
reflected in a change of the geometry of all the universe. In conclusion any
local physical change or physical process is reflected in all the universe by
the change of its geometry, This is the deepest meaning of the entanglement in
Quantum mechanics and quantum computing. We stress the connection between
metric and information as measure of change. Because computation is not
restricted to calculus but is the environment changing via physical processes,
super-Turing potentialities derive from an incomputable information source
embedded into the geometry of the universe in accordance with Bell's
constraints. In the general relativity we define the geometry of the space
time. In our approach quantum phenomena define the geometry of the parameters
of the probability distribution that include also the space time parameters. To
study this new approach to the computation we use the new theory of Morphogenic
systems.

multi-local decoherence undergo distillability sudden death whereas their
locally equivalent states do not exhibit such behavior. We have found that
their basic equation of motion missed some terms and therefore the subsequent
calculations and conclusions are not correct/valid except that distillability
sudden death may occur. We provide the missing terms and point out the

we have studied this feature for certain entangled states under global,

just a single particle, when one considers the subsystems to be distant spatial

a bipartite Bell inequality. In this paper, we introduce an N-party Hardy-like
proof of impossibility of local elements of reality and a Bell inequality for
local realistic theories for a single particle superposed symmetrical over N
spatial field modes (i.e. a N qubit W state). We show that, in the limit of

  Operating in the Quantum Hall Effect Regime</title><description>  Interference of edge channels is expected to be a prominent tool for studying
statistics of charged quasiparticles in the quantum Hall effect (QHE) [A. Stern
(2008), Ann. Phys. 1:204; C. Chamon et al. (1997), Phys. Rev. B, 55:2331]. We
present here a detailed study of an electronic Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI)
operating in the QHE regime [C. Chamon et al. (1997), Phys. Rev. B, 55:2331],
with the phase of the interfering quasiparticles controlled by the
Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect. Our main finding is that Coulomb interactions among
the electrons dominate the interference, even in a relatively large area FPI,
leading to a strong dependence of the area enclosed by the interference loop on
the magnetic field. In particular, for a composite edge structure, with a few
independent edge channels propagating along the edge, interference of the
outmost edge channel (belonging to the lowest Landau level) was insensitive to
magnetic field; suggesting a constant enclosed flux. However, when any of the
inner edge channels interfered, the enclosed flux decreased when the magnetic
field increased. By intentionally varying the enclosed area with a biased
metallic gate and observing the periodicity of the interference pattern,
charges e (for integer filling factors) and e/3 (for a fractional filling
factor) were found to be expelled from the FPI. Moreover, these observations
provided also a novel way of detecting the charge of the interfering
quasiparticles.

a large many-body system where all the pairs are generally entangled with each

&quot;decided&quot; by a sequence of quantum (random) outcomes.

  First, we show that for any problem that is invariant under permuting inputs

imperfectly transferred from a sender to a remote receiver in a
continuous-variable setting. We recall the ingenious scheme proposed by
Braunstein and Kimble for teleporting a one-mode state of the quantum radiation
field. By analyzing this protocol, we have previously proven the factorization
of the characteristic function of the output state. This indicates that
teleportation is a noisy process that alters, to some extent, the input state.
Teleportation with a two-mode Gaussian EPR state can be described in terms of
the superposition of a distorting field with the input one. Here we analyze the
one-mode Gaussian distorting-field state. Some of its most important properties
are determined by the statistics of a positive EPR operator in the two-mode
Gaussian resource state. We finally examine the fidelity of teleportation of a

Therefore, the probability space behaves like a gauge parameter. We discuss the
technical issues of this theory and apply the concept to classically emulate
quantum entangled states and even `super-quantum' systems. We exhibit bipartite
examples leading to maximum violation of Bell-CHSH inequalities like EPR pairs
or exceeding the Tsirelson bound like PR-boxes, as well as tripartite cases
simulating GHZ or W-states. We address also the question of partially
correlated systems and multipartite entanglements. In this model, the classical
equivalent of the entanglement entropy is identified with the Kullback-Leibler

multipartite systems, leading to a simple evaluation of the degree of
entanglement and determining the bounds of maximum entanglement. Finally, we

channels and the distance that it induces. We adopt an information-geometric
approach and define a metric derived from the Bures-Fisher metric for quantum

Bures-Fisher metric and is operationally motivated from distinguishability
considerations: It serves as an upper bound to the attainable quantum Fisher
information for the channel parameters using Gaussian states, under generic
constraints on the physically available resources. Our approach naturally
includes the use of entangled Gaussian probe states. We prove that the metric
enjoys some desirable properties like stability and covariance. As a byproduct,
we also obtain some general results in Gaussian channel estimation that are the
continuous-variable analogs of previously known results in finite dimensions.
We prove that optimal probe states are always pure and bounded in the number of
ancillary modes, even in the presence of constraints on the reduced state input
in the channel. This has experimental and computational implications: It limits
the complexity of optimal experimental setups for channel estimation and
reduces the computational requirements for the evaluation of the metric:
Indeed, we construct a converging algorithm for its computation. We provide
explicit formulae for computing the multiparametric quantum Fisher information
for dissipative channels probed with arbitrary Gaussian states, and provide the
optimal observables for the estimation of the channel parameters (e.g. bath
couplings, squeezing, and temperature).

1-generate $\phi$. This gives a stronger reality filter that may produce a
unique coevent called the ``actual reality'' for a physical system. What we

1 or 2-generate coevents except in a few simple cases. Examples are given which

sufficient condition for stabilizer states that violate the LU-LC conjecture is
missing. In this paper, we investigate further the properties of stabilizer
states with respect to local equivalence. Our first result shows that there
exist infinitely many stabilizer states which violate the LU-LC conjecture. In
particular, we show that for all numbers of qubits $n\geq 28$, there exist
distance two stabilizer states which are counterexamples to the LU-LC
conjecture. We prove that for all odd $n\geq 195$, there exist stabilizer
states with distance greater than two which are LU equivalent but not LC
equivalent. Two important classes of stabilizer states that are of great
interest in quantum computation are the cluster states and stabilizer states of
the surface codes. To date, the status of these states with respect to the
LU-LC conjecture was not studied. We show that, under some minimal
restrictions, both these classes of states preclude any counterexamples. In
this context, we also show that the associated surface codes do not have any
encoded non-Clifford transversal gates. We characterize the CSS surface code
states in terms of a class of minor closed binary matroids. In addition to
making connection with an important open problem in binary matroid theory, this
characterization does in some cases provide an efficient test for CSS states

  We then apply our results to the recently studied model of random k-QSAT.
Recent works have shown that the satisfiable region extends up to a density of
1 in the large k limit, where the density is the ratio of projectors to qubits.
Using a hybrid approach building on work by Laumann et al. we greatly extend
the known satisfiable region for random k-QSAT to a density of
$\Omega(2^k/k^2)$. Since our tool allows us to show the existence of joint
satisfying states without the need to construct them, we are able to penetrate
into regions where the satisfying states are conjectured to be entangled,
avoiding the need to construct them, which has limited previous approaches to
product states.

an ion to state-dependent displacement operations interleaved with quantum coin
tossing operations. To analyze the ion's motional state after each step we
apply a technique that directly maps the probability density distribution onto
the ion's internal state. The measured probability distributions and the
position's second moment clearly show the non-classical character of the

Finally, we extend the quantum walk by using two ions, giving the walker the

Landau-Zener transition. When a two-level system (TLS) is subject to periodic
driving with sufficiently large amplitude, a sequence of transitions occurs.
The phase accumulated between transitions (commonly known as the Stuckelberg
phase) may result in constructive or destructive interference. Accordingly, the
physical observables of the system exhibit periodic dependence on the various
system parameters. This phenomenon is often referred to as
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg (LZS) interferometry. Phenomena related to LZS
interferometry occur in a variety of physical systems. In particular, recent
experiments on LZS interferometry in superconducting TLSs (qubits) have
demonstrated the potential for using this kind of interferometry as an
effective tool for obtaining the parameters characterizing the TLS as well as
its interaction with the control fields and with the environment. Furthermore,
strong driving could allow for fast and reliable control of the quantum system.
Here we review recent experimental results on LZS interferometry, and we

well-known theories that represent a basis for modern physics. The two
described theories are well known and have been well studied. As these theories
contain numerous paradoxes, many scientists doubt their internal consistencies.
However, these paradoxes can be resolved within the framework of the existing
physics without the introduction of new laws. To clarify the paper for the
inexperienced reader, we include certain necessary basic concepts of
statistical physics and quantum mechanics in this paper without the use of
formulas. Exact formulas and explanations are included in the Appendices. The
text is supplemented by illustrations to enhance the understanding of the
paper. The paradoxes underlying thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are also
discussed. The approaches to the solutions of these paradoxes are suggested.
The first approach is dependent on the influence of the external observer
(environment), which disrupts the correlations in the system. The second
approach is based on the limits of the self-knowledge of the system for the
case in which both the external observer and the environment are included in
the considered system. The concepts of observable dynamics, ideal dynamics, and
unpredictable dynamics are introduced. The phenomenon of complex (living)
systems is contemplated from the point of view of these dynamics.

standard statistical models and all Abelian discrete lattice gauge theories
(LGTs), can be expressed as a special instance of the partition function of a
4-dimensional pure LGT with gauge group Z_2 (4D Z_2 LGT). This provides a
unification of models with apparently very different features into a single
complete model. The result uses an equality between the Hamilton function of
any classical spin model and the Hamilton function of a model with all possible
k-body Ising-type interactions, for all k, which we also prove. Here, we
elaborate on the proof of the result, and we illustrate it by computing
quantities of a specific model as a function of the partition function of the
4D Z_2 LGT. The result also allows one to establish a new method to compute the
mean-field theory of Z_2 LGTs with d &gt; 3, and to show that computing the
partition function of the 4D Z_2 LGT is computationally hard (#P hard). The

  the Newcomb problem</title><description>  I apply some of the lessons from quantum theory, in particular from Bell's
theorem, to a debate on the foundations of decision theory and causation. By
tracing a formal analogy between the basic assumptions of Causal Decision
Theory (CDT)--which was developed partly in response to Newcomb's problem-- and
those of a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) theory in the context of quantum
mechanics, I show that an agent who acts according to CDT and gives any nonzero
credence to some possible causal interpretations underlying quantum phenomena
should bet against quantum mechanics in some feasible game scenarios involving
entangled systems, no matter what evidence they acquire. As a consequence,
either the most accepted version of decision theory is wrong, or it provides a
practical distinction, in terms of the prescribed behaviour of rational agents,
between some metaphysical hypotheses regarding the causal structure underlying
quantum mechanics.

  could have told Einstein at Solvay had he known about Bell experiments)</title><description>  The 1964 theorem of John Bell shows that no model that reproduces the
predictions of quantum mechanics can simultaneously satisfy the assumptions of
locality and determinism. On the other hand, the assumptions of \emph{signal
locality} plus \emph{predictability} are also sufficient to derive Bell
inequalities. This simple theorem, previously noted but published only
relatively recently by Masanes, Acin and Gisin, has fundamental implications
not entirely appreciated. Firstly, nothing can be concluded about the
ontological assumptions of locality or determinism independently of each other
-- it is possible to reproduce quantum mechanics with deterministic models that
violate locality as well as indeterministic models that satisfy locality. On
the other hand, the operational assumption of signal locality is an empirically
testable (and well-tested) consequence of relativity. Thus Bell inequality
violations imply that we can trust that some events are fundamentally
\emph{unpredictable}, even if we cannot trust that they are indeterministic.
This result grounds the quantum-mechanical prohibition of arbitrarily accurate
predictions on the assumption of no superluminal signalling, regardless of any
postulates of quantum mechanics. It also sheds a new light on an early stage of
the historical debate between Einstein and Bohr.

Physique des Lasers and dedicated to an optical measurement of the Boltzmann
constant. With the proposed innovative technique, determining comes down to an
ordinary frequency measurement. The method consists in measuring as accurately
as possible the Doppler absorption profile of a rovibrational line of ammonia
in thermal equilibrium. This profile is related to the Maxwell-Boltzmann
molecular velocity distribution along the laser beam. A fit of the absorption
line shape leads to a determination of the Doppler width proportional to
sqrt(kT) and thus to a determination of the Boltzmann constant. The laser
source is an ultra-stable CO2 laser with a wavelength . The absorption cell is
placed in a thermostat keeping the temperature at 273.15 K within 1.4 mK. We
were able to measure with a relative uncertainty as small as 3.8x10-5, which
represents an improvement of an order of magnitude for an integration time

dynamically evolving closed quantum systems locally appear as if they had truly

understanding of relaxation in suddenly quenched quantum many-body systems. The

  electromagnetic field in scale relativity</title><description>  Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations are the motion equations for relativistic
particles with spin 0 (so-called scalar particles) and 1/2 (electron/positron)
respectively. For a free particle, the Dirac equation is derived from the
Klein-Gordon equation by taking its square root in a bi-quaternionic formalism
fully justified by the first principles of the scale relativity theory. This is
no more true when an external electro-magnetic field comes into play. If one
tries to derive the electro-magnetic Dirac equation in a manner analogous to
the one used when this field is absent, one obtains an additional term which is
the relativistic analogue of the spin-magnetic field coupling term encountered
in the Pauli equation, valid for a non-relativistic particle with spin 1/2.
There is however a method to recover the standard form of the electro-magnetic
Dirac equation, with no additional term, which amounts modifying the way both
covariances involved here, quantum and scale, are implemented. Without going
into technical details, it will be shown how these results suggest this last
method is based on more profound roots of the scale relativity theory since it

discussion of the ordinary Casimir force on and the Casimir stress in a metal
(plasma) slab in a planar cavity. We demonstrate strong dependence of the
Casimir stress in a thin slab on properties of the bounding medium in the
symmetric Lifshitz configuration. Contrary to this, the stress in a thick slab
gradually becomes insensitive on external boundary conditions. We also consider
the position dependence of the Casimir force on and stress in a thin metal slab

increases when it approaches a mirror the stress in the slab decreases and
eventually changes the sign. Generally, the stress decreases with the cavity

using the Glauber representation of coherent laser radiation. The objective is
to find optimal (or suboptimal) measurement operators and to evaluate the
corresponding error probability. For PPM, the correct formulation of quantum
states is given by the tensorial product of m identical Hilbert spaces, where m
is the PPM order. The presence of mixed states, due to thermal noise, generates
an optimization problem involving matrices of huge dimensions, which already
for 4-PPM, are of the order of ten thousand. To overcome this computational
complexity, the currently available methods of quantum detection, which are
based on explicit results, convex linear programming and square root
measurement, are compared to find the computationally less expensive one. In
this paper a fundamental role is played by the geometrically uniform symmetry
of the quantum PPM format. The evaluation of error probability confirms the

However, the topologically protected operations that may be obtained by

  Dielectric Media in Thermal Equilibrium</title><description>  The derivation of Casimir forces between dielectrics can be simplified by
ignoring absorption, calculating energy changes due to displacements of the
dielectrics, and only then admitting absorption by allowing permittivities to
be complex. As a first step towards a better understanding of this situation we
consider in this paper the model of a dielectric as a collection of
oscillators, each of which is coupled to a reservoir giving rise to damping and
Langevin forces on the oscillators and a noise polarization acting as a source
of a fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) field in the dielectric. The model leads
naturally to expressions for the quantized EM fields that are consistent with
those obtained by different approaches, and also results in a
fluctuation-dissipation relation between the noise polarization and the
imaginary part of the permittivity; comparison with the Rytov
fluctuation-dissipation relation employed in the well-known Lifshitz theory for
the van der Waals (or Casimir) force shows that the Lifshitz theory is actually
a classical stochastic electrodynamical theory. The approximate classical
expression for the energy density in a band of frequencies at which absorption
in a dielectric is negligible is shown to be exact as a spectral thermal
equilibrium expectation value in the quantum-electrodynamical theory. Our main
result is the derivation of an expression for the QED energy density of a
uniform dispersive, absorbing media in thermal equilibrium. The spectral
density of the energy is found to have the same form with or without
absorption. We also show how the fluctuation-dissipation theorem ensures a
detailed balance of energy exchange between the (absorbing) medium, the
reservoir and the EM field in thermal equilibrium.

universality of the principles of new cybernetics.
  The second paper: recent letter by Maccone presents a solution based on the
existing laws of quantum mechanics to the arrow-of-time dilemma. He argues that
all phenomena in which the entropy decreases must not leave any information (in
the observer's memory) of their having occurred because the observer is a part
of the whole system. Maccone concludes that quantum mechanics is necessary to
his argument, which he believes does not otherwise work in classical mechanics.
This Comment consists of four parts. We discuss the basic problems in the first
part. This Comment and the previously published Comment by Jennings and Rudolph
describes flaws in Maccone's arguments. However, the main argument (erasure of
the observer's memory), which was previously formulated in our work and was
repeated by Maccone, is correct under the conditions described in this Comment.
Moreover, this argument can be used to resolve a reduction paradox (the
Schrodinger's Cat paradox) in quantum mechanics. This use is demonstrated in
the second part. In the third part, the synchronisation (decoherence) of time
arrows is discussed. In the fourth part, the synchronisation (decoherence) of
time arrows in quantum gravity is considered.

an effective way of preparing decoy states in principle, in practice passive
preparation might be desirable in some scenarios. Typical passive schemes
involve parametric down-conversion. More recently, it has been shown that phase
randomized weak coherent pulses (WCP) can also be used for the same purpose [M.
Curty {\it et al.}, Opt. Lett. {\bf 34}, 3238 (2009).] This proposal requires
only linear optics together with a simple threshold photon detector, which
shows the practical feasibility of the method. Most importantly, the resulting
secret key rate is comparable to the one delivered by an active decoy state
setup with an infinite number of decoy settings. In this paper we extend these
results, now showing specifically the analysis for other practical scenarios

sources emitting thermal states, phase randomized WCP, and strong coherent
light in combination with several types of photo-detectors, like, for instance,
threshold photon detectors, photon number resolving detectors, and classical
photo-detectors. Our analysis includes as well the effect that detection
inefficiencies and noise in the form of dark counts shown by current threshold

  sterile neutrino</title><description>  We conjecture that the neutrino mixing matrix must be such that in the
flavour oscillation process the energy expectation values enjoy flavour
independence. Based on this conjecture we present unitarity and energy
conservation constraints on neutrino oscillation parameters. In our analysis
\theta_{13} depends on the ratio of the mass-squared differences \zeta and on
\theta_{12} alone; while \delta_{CP} is completely determined by \zeta,
\theta_{12}, and \theta_{23}. The standard neutrino oscillation phenomenology
(SNOP) suggests \zeta \approx 30. The resulting prediction for \theta_{13}
conflicts with SNOP expectation for all values of \theta_{12}. This leads to
the suggestion that some non-standard neutrino interactions may be intervening
to invalidate the SNOP inferred \zeta and \theta_{13}. An alternate inference
is to go beyond the three flavours of SNOP and incorporate sterile neutrinos in
the analysis.

  coupling</title><description>  We describe a relation between the requirement of complete population
transfer in a four-mode system and the generating function of Pythagorean
triples from number theory. We show that complete population transfer will
occur if ratios between coupling coefficients exactly match one of the
Pythagorean triples (a; b; c) in Z, c^{2} = a^{2} + b^{2}. For a four-level
ladder system this relation takes a simple form (V12; V23; V34) ~ (c; b; a),
where coefficients Vij describe the coupling between modes. We find that the
structure of the evolution operator and the period of complete population
transfer are determined by two distinct frequencies. A combination of these
frequencies provides a generalization of the two-mode Rabi frequency for a
four-mode system.

  in the Electro-Vibrational Ground State</title><description>  We consider two-color heteronuclear photoassociation of atoms into dipolar
molecules in the J=1 electro-vibrational ground state, where a free-ground
laser couples atoms directly to the ground state and a free-bound laser couples
the atoms to an electronically-excited state. This problem raises an interest
because heteronuclear photoassociation from atoms to near-ground state
molecules is limited by the small size of the target state. Nevertheless, the
addition of the excited state creates a second pathway for creating ground
state molecules, leading to quantum interference between direct
photoassociation and photoassociation via the excited molecular state, as well
as a dispersive-like shift of the free-ground resonance position. Using LiNa as
an example, these results are shown to depend on the detuning and intensity of
the free-bound laser, as well as the semi-classical size of both molecular

electro-vibrational ground state is possible only in a limited regime near the

initial correlations with an environment. Here the standard formalism of
describing evolution by completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) quantum
operations can fail and non-completely positive (non-CP) maps may be observed.
  A new classification of correlations between a system and environment using
quantum discord is explored. However, we find quantum discord is not a
symmetric quantity between exchange of systems and this leads to ambiguity in
classifications - states which are both quantum and classically correlated
depending on the order of the two systems.
  State preparation in quantum process tomography is investigated with regard
to non-CP maps. In SQPT the preparation procedure can influence the
complete-positivity of the reconstructed quantum operation if our system is
initially correlated with an environment. We examine a recently proposed
preparation procedures using projective measurements, and propose our own
protocol that uses a single measurement followed by unitary rotations. The
former can give rise to non-CP evolution while the later will always give rise
to a CP map. State preparation in AAPT was found always to give rise to CP
evolution.
  We examine the effect of statistical noise in process tomography and find it
can result in the identification of a non-CP when the evolution should be CP.
The variance of the distribution for reconstructed processes is found to be
inversely proportional to the number of copies of a state used to perform
tomography. Finally, we detail an experiment using currently available linear
optics QC devices to demonstrate non-CP maps arising in SQPT.

  quantum-classical problem: A new approach</title><description>  We present a new approach to the quantum-classical problem, which treats it
as the problem of modelling the quantum phenomenon described by a coherent
superposition of microscopically distinct substates (CSMDS) as a compound one
consisting of alternative subprocesses creating unremovable contexts for each
other, or as that of reducing a non-Kolmogorovian quantum probability space to
underlie a CSMDS to the sum of Kolmogorovian ones. We develop such models for a
1D completed scattering and double slit diffraction. The quantum-classical
problem disappears when, in quantum theory with its integral superposition
principle, CSMDSs obey the &quot;either-or&quot; rule to guide alternative random events.
There is no observable which could be associated with the whole ensemble of
statistical data described by a CSMDS, because such data are incompatible -- in
the case of a CSMDS, any observable splits into noncommuting observables
associated with the substates. To calculate the average value of any observable
as well as to introduce characteristic times is meaningful only for the
substates of a CSMDS. Ignoring this feature in the conventional description of
CSMDSs just leads to paradoxical results (e.g., to the Hartman effect and
passing a particle through two slits in the screen simultaneously).

physical process. Inaccuracies in the theoretical modelling of such processes

reliability of random number generators in ways that are difficult to control

of genuine randomness. It is thereby possible to design of a new type of
cryptographically secure random number generator which does not require any

randomness generation is impossible classically and possible in quantum systems
only if certified by a Bell inequality violation. We carry out a

simulation, electrostatic simulation, and computer assisted design (CAD)
lay-out packages are used to develop a three dimensional (3D) classical
capacitance model. The agreement of the capacitances of the classical model is
tested against two different, experimentally measured, topographically complex

non-orthogonal states of a qubit against dephasing--we experimentally explore
the use of weak measurements in feedback control. We find that, despite the
intrinsic difficultly of implementing them, weak measurements allow us to
control the qubit better in practice than is even theoretically possible
without them. Our work shows that these more general quantum measurements can
play an important role for feedback control of quantum systems.

after local measurements on multipartite systems. Sufficient conditions for a
quantum system to be fully-nonlocal according to a given partition, as well as
being (genuinely) multipartite fully-nonlocal, are derived. These conditions
allow us to identify all completely-connected graph states as multipartite
fully-nonlocal quantum states. Moreover, we show that this feature can also be
observed in mixed states: the tensor product of five copies of the Smolin
state, a biseparable and bound entangled state, is multipartite fully-nonlocal.

dispersion can be neglected during the atomic excited-state lifetime. Different
from previous treatments using common or statistically independent reservoirs,
a continuous transition between these limits is observed, that depends on the

entanglement sudden death and birth as predicted here deviates from the case
where the inter-atomic distance is treated classically by a static value.
Moreover, the creation of a dark state is predicted, which manifests itself by
a stationary entanglement that even may be created from an initially separable

applications. Tasks such state transfer or quantum computation have been well
studied with a linear chain, but hardly with systems, which do not possess a
linear structure. While this difference does not disturb the end-to-end
dynamics of a single excitation, the evolution is significantly changed in
other subspaces. Here we quantify the difference between a linear chain and a
pseudo-chain, which have more than one spin at some site (block). We show how
to estimate a number of all spins in the system and the intra-block coupling
constants. We also suggest how it is possible to eliminate excitations trapped
in such blocks, which may disturb the state transfer. Importantly, one uses
only at-ends data and needs to be able to put the system to either the
maximally magnetized or the maximally mixed state. This can obtained by
controlling a global decoherence parameter, such as temperature.

envisaged a machine capable of simulating generic quantum mechanical systems, a
task that is believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a machine
would have a wide range of applications in the simulation of many-body quantum
physics, including condensed matter physics, chemistry, and high energy
physics. Part of Feynman's challenge was met by Lloyd who showed how to
approximately decompose the time-evolution operator of interacting quantum
particles into a short sequence of elementary gates, suitable for operation on
a quantum computer. However, this left open the problem of how to simulate the
equilibrium and static properties of quantum systems. This requires the
preparation of ground and Gibbs states on a quantum computer. For classical
systems, this problem is solved by the ubiquitous Metropolis algorithm, a
method that basically acquired a monopoly for the simulation of interacting
particles. Here, we demonstrate how to implement a quantum version of the
Metropolis algorithm on a quantum computer. This algorithm permits to sample
directly from the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian and thus evades the sign
problem present in classical simulations. A small scale implementation of this
algorithm can already be achieved with today's technology

In the
first, we discuss the task of coin tossing, principally in order to highlight
the effect different physical theories have on security in a straightforward
manner, but, also, to introduce a new protocol for non-relativistic strong coin
tossing. This protocol matches the security of the best protocol known to date
while using a conceptually different approach to achieve the task.
  In the second part variable bias coin tossing is introduced. This is a
variant of coin tossing in which one party secretly chooses one of two biased
coins to toss. It is shown that this can be achieved with unconditional
security for a specified range of biases, and with cheat-evident security for
any bias. We also discuss two further protocols which are conjectured to be
unconditionally secure for any bias.
  The third section looks at other two-party secure computations for which,
prior to our work, protocols and no-go theorems were unknown. We introduce a
general model for such computations, and show that, within this model, a wide
range of functions are impossible to compute securely. We give explicit
cheating attacks for such functions.
  In the final chapter we discuss the task of expanding a private random
string, while dropping the usual assumption that the protocol's user trusts her
devices. Instead we assume that all quantum devices are supplied by an
arbitrarily malicious adversary. We give two protocols that we conjecture
securely perform this task. The first allows a private random string to be
expanded by a finite amount, while the second generates an arbitrarily large
expansion of such a string.

limitations on the asymptotic stability of quantum information stored in

implementation of the protecting Hamiltonian in the form of perturbations or
weak coupling to a ground state environment. We prove that, regardless of the
protecting Hamiltonian, there exists a perturbed evolution that necessitates a
final error correcting step when the state of the memory is read. Such an error
correction step is shown to require a finite error threshold, the lack thereof
being exemplified by the 3D compass model. We go on to present explicit weak
Hamiltonian perturbations which destroy the logical information stored in the
2D toric code in a time O(log(N)).

  clique-wise entanglement</title><description>  XOR games are a simple computational model with connections to many areas of
complexity theory. Perhaps the earliest use of XOR games was in the study of
quantum correlations. XOR games also have an interesting connection to
Grothendieck's inequality, a fundamental theorem of analysis, which shows that
two players sharing entanglement can achieve at most a constant factor
advantage over players following classical strategies in an XOR game.
  Perez-Garcia et al. show that when the players share GHZ states, this
advantage is bounded by a constant. We use a multilinear generalization of
Grothendieck's inequality due to Blei and Tonge to simplify the proof of the
second result and extend it to the case of so-called Schmidt states, answering
an open problem of Perez-Garcia et al. Via a reduction given in that paper,
this answers a 35-year-old problem in operator algebras due to Varopoulos,
showing that the space of compact operators on a Hilbert space is a Q-algebra
under Schur product.
  A further generalization of Grothendieck's inequality due to Carne lets us
show that the gap between the entangled and classical value is at most a
constant in any multiplayer XOR game in which the players are allowed to share
combinations of GHZ states and EPR pairs of any dimension.
  As an application of our results, we show that the discrepancy method in
communication complexity remains a lower bound in the multiparty model where
the players have quantum communication and the kinds of entanglement discussed
above. This answers an open question of Lee, Schechtman, and Shraibman.

emergence of the objective, classical world from the quantum substrate. The key
to this emergence is the proliferation of redundant information throughout the
environment where observers can then intercept it. We study this process for a
purely decohering interaction when the environment, E, is in a non-ideal (e.g.,
mixed) initial state. In the case of good decoherence, that is, after the
pointer states have been unambiguously selected, the mutual information between
the system, S, and an environment fragment, F, is given solely by F's entropy
increase. This demonstrates that the environment's capacity for recording the
state of S is directly related to its ability to increase its entropy.
Environments that remain nearly invariant under the interaction with S, either
because they have a large initial entropy or a misaligned initial state,
therefore have a diminished ability to acquire information. To elucidate the
concept of good decoherence, we show that - when decoherence is not complete -
the deviation of the mutual information from F's entropy change is quantified
by the quantum discord, i.e., the excess mutual information between S and F is
information regarding the initial coherence between pointer states of S. In
addition to illustrating these results with a single qubit system interacting
with a multi-qubit environment, we find scaling relations for the redundancy of
information acquired by the environment that display a universal behavior
independent of the initial state of S. Our results demonstrate that Quantum
Darwinism is robust with respect to non-ideal initial states of the
environment: the environment almost always acquires redundant information about
the system but its rate of acquisition can be reduced.

  tomography</title><description>  Given an experimental set-up and a fixed number of measurements, how should
one take data in order to optimally reconstruct the state of a quantum system?
The problem of optimal experiment design (OED) for quantum state tomography was
first broached by Kosut et al. [arXiv:quant-ph/0411093v1]. Here we provide
efficient numerical algorithms for finding the optimal design, and analytic
results for the case of 'minimal tomography'. We also introduce the average
OED, which is independent of the state to be reconstructed, and the optimal
design for tomography (ODT), which minimizes tomographic bias. We find that
these two designs are generally similar. Monte-Carlo simulations confirm the
utility of our results for qubits. Finally, we adapt our approach to deal with
constrained techniques such as maximum likelihood estimation. We find that
these are less amenable to optimization than cruder reconstruction methods,
such as linear inversion.

study the relation between spin squeezing parameters and entanglement through
the quantum entropy of a system starts initially in a pure state when the
cavity is binomial. We show that spin squeezing can be a convenient tool to
give some insight into the subsystems entanglement dynamics when the bipartite
subsystem interacts simultaneously with the cavity field subsystem, specially
when the interaction occurs off-resonantly without and with a nonlinear medium
contained in the cavity field subsystem. We illustrate that, in case of large
off-resonance interaction, spin squeezing clarifies the properties of
entanglement almost with full success. However, it is not a general rule when
the cavity is assumed to be filled with a non-linear medium. In this case, we
illustrate that the insight into entanglement dynamics becomes more clearly in
case of a weak nonlinear medium than in strong nonlinear medium. In parallel,
the role of the phase space distribution in quantifying entanglement is also
studied. The numerical results of Husimi $Q$-function show that the integer
strength of the nonlinear medium produces Schr\&quot;{o}dinger cat states which is

on the impossibility of faster-than-light signaling; however, their protocol is
inefficient and cannot tolerate any noise. While their key-distribution scheme
uses quantum entanglement, its security only relies on the impossibility of
superluminal signaling, rather than the correctness and completeness of quantum
theory. In particular, the resulting security is device independent. Here we
introduce a new protocol which is efficient in terms of both classical and
quantum communication, and that can tolerate noise in the quantum channel. We
prove that it offers device-independent security under the sole assumption that
certain non-signaling conditions are satisfied. Our main insight is that the
XOR of a number of bits that are partially secret according to the
non-signaling conditions turns out to be highly secret. Note that similar
statements have been well-known in classical contexts. Earlier results had
indicated that amplification of such non-signaling-based privacy is impossible

Analytic solutions using the two-state model are obtained and found to be

  In particular, a simple formula for the decoherence rate in terms of the
noise parameters in the two-state model is reviewed and verified for the full

multiple sources of noise or different &quot;dephasing&quot; axes at the same time.
Furthermore, the old formula for the &quot;Turing-Watched Pot&quot; effect is generalized

  Various forms for the noise signal are investigated. An interesting result is
the importance of the noise power at low frequency. If it vanishes there is, in
leading order, no decoherence. This is verified in a numerical simulation where
two apparently similar noise signals, but differing in the power at zero
frequency, give strikingly different decoherence effects. A short discussion of

  Averaging Assumptions</title><description>  We consider two-dimensional Hamiltonians on a torus with finite range, finite
strength interactions and a unique ground state with a non-vanishing spectral
gap, and a conserved local charge, as defined precisely in the text. Using the
local charge operators, we introduce a boundary magnetic flux in the horizontal
and vertical direction and evolve the ground state quasi-adiabatically around a
square of size one magnetic flux, in flux space. At the end of the evolution we
obtain a trivial Berry phase, which we compare, via a method reminiscent of
Stokes' Theorem, to the Berry phase obtained from an evolution around a small
loop near the origin. As a result, we prove, without any averaging assumption,
that the Hall conductance for interacting electron systems is quantized in
integer multiples of e^2/h up to small corrections bounded by a function that
decays as a stretched exponential in the linear size L. Finally, we discuss
extensions to the fractional case under an additional topological order
assumption to describe the multiple degenerate ground states.

Because all stabilizer states are equivalent to a graph state by local unitary

detection of cell membrane ion channel operation with wide-field capability.
Existing techniques are generally invasive, require specialized nano
structures, or are only applicable to certain ion channel species. We show that
quantum nanotechnology has enormous potential to provide a novel solution to
this problem. The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centre in nano-diamond is currently of
great interest as a novel single atom quantum probe for nanoscale processes.
However, until now, beyond the use of diamond nanocrystals as fluorescence
markers, nothing was known about the quantum behaviour of a NV probe in the
complex room temperature extra-cellular environment. For the first time we
explore in detail the quantum dynamics of a NV probe in proximity to the ion
channel, lipid bilayer and surrounding aqueous environment. Our theoretical
results indicate that real-time detection of ion channel operation at
millisecond resolution is possible by directly monitoring the quantum
decoherence of the NV probe. With the potential to scan and scale-up to an
array-based system this conclusion may have wide ranging implications for
nanoscale biology and drug discovery.

conditions completely define the final state of the system, and in the case of

first such extractor to achieve an output length $\Theta(K-b)$, where $K$ is
the source's entropy and $b$ the adversary's storage, together with a
poly-logarithmic seed length. Another instantiation achieves a logarithmic key
length, with a slightly smaller output length $\Theta((K-b)/K^\gamma)$ for any
$\gamma&gt;0$. In contrast, the previous best construction \cite{TS09} could only
extract $(K/b)^{1/15}$ bits. Some of our constructions have the additional
advantage that every bit of the output is a function of only a polylogarithmic
number of bits from the source, which is crucial for some cryptographic
applications.
  Our argument is based on bounds for a generalization of quantum random access

it lets us avoid the local list-decoding algorithm central to the approach in

pulse on the three-level $\Lambda$ - type atom in microcavity is studied. The
duration of the pulse is considered to be short enough, so that the hyperfine
structure of the upper level remains totally unresolved, while that of the
lower level is totally resolved. The coherent laser pulse is assumed to be in
resonance with the transition between one hyperfine structure component of the
lower atomic level and all hyperfine structure components of the upper level,
while the quantized cavity field is assumed to be in resonance with the
transition between the other hyperfine structure component of the lower level
and all components of the upper one. The dependence of the photon emission
probability on the mutual orientation of polarization vectors of the cavity
mode and of the coherent laser pulse is analyzed. Particularly, the case is
investigated, when the total electronic angular momentum of the lower atomic
level equals 1/2, which is true for the ground states of alkali atoms employed
in the experiments on deterministic single photon emission. It is shown, that
in this case the probability of photon emission equals zero for collinear
polarizations of the photon and of the laser pulse, and the probability obtains
its maximum value, when the angle between their polarizations equals 60
degrees.

calculations, for a system of two single-photon wavepackets interacting via an
ideal, localized Kerr medium. It is shown that, because of spontaneous emission
into the initially unoccupied temporal modes, the cross-phase modulation in the
Schrodinger picture is very small as long as the spectral width of the
single-photon pulses is well within the medium's bandwidth. In this limit, the
Hamiltonian used can be derived from the &quot;giant Kerr effect&quot; for a four-level
atom, under conditions of electromagnetically-induced transparency; it is shown
explicitly that the linear absorption in this system increases as the pulse's
spectral width approaches the medium's transparency bandwidth, and hence, as
long as the absorption probability remains small, the maximum cross-phase
modulation is limited to essentially useless values. These results are in

is one of the central problems in quantum mechanics, and in this respect, the
local density of states (LDOS) provides an in- depth description of such a
response. The LDOS is the distribution of the overlaps squared connecting the
set of eigenfunctions with the perturbed one. Here, we show that in the case of
closed systems with classically chaotic dynamics, the LDOS is a Breit-Wigner

Consequently, we derive a semiclassical expression for the width of the LDOS

This Letter demonstrates the universal response of quantum systems with

algorithms exploit the Fourier transform in some way. In Shor's algorithm,
sampling from the quantum Fourier spectrum is used to discover periodicity of
the modular exponentiation function. In a generalization of this idea, quantum
Fourier sampling can be used to discover hidden subgroup structures of some
functions much more efficiently than it is possible classically. Another
problem for which the Fourier transform has been recruited successfully on a
quantum computer is the hidden shift problem. Quantum algorithms for hidden
shift problems usually have a slightly different flavor from hidden subgroup
algorithms, as they use the Fourier transform to perform a correlation with a
given reference function, instead of sampling from the Fourier spectrum
directly. In this paper we show that hidden shifts can be extracted efficiently
from Boolean functions that are quadratic forms. We also show how to identify
an unknown quadratic form on n variables using a linear number of queries, in
contrast to the classical case were this takes Theta(n^2) many queries to a
black box. What is more, we show that our quantum algorithm is robust in the
sense that it can also infer the shift if the function is close to a quadratic,
where we consider a Boolean function to be close to a quadratic if it has a
large Gowers U_3 norm.

calculate the differential rate and concurrence for a backscattering setup of

two atomic states but may induce considerable phase shifts. The acquired phases
are usually calculated by using the adiabatic-elimination approximation. We
analyze the accuracy of this approximation and derive the conditions for its
applicability to the calculation of the phases. We account for various sources
of imperfections, ranging from higher terms in the adiabatic-elimination
expansion and irreversible population loss to couplings to additional states.
We find that, as far as the phase shifts are concerned, the adiabatic
elimination is accurate only for a very large detuning. We show that the
adiabatic approximation is a far more accurate method for evaluating the phase
shifts, with a vast domain of validity; the accuracy is further enhanced by
superadiabatic corrections, which reduce the error well below $10^{-4}$.
Moreover, owing to the effect of adiabatic population return, the adiabatic and
superadiabatic approximations allow one to calculate the phase shifts even for
a moderately large detuning, and even when the peak Rabi frequency is larger
than the detuning; in these regimes the adiabatic elimination is completely
inapplicable. We also derive several exact expressions for the phases using
exactly soluble two-state and three-state analytical models.

specifically consider the situation where the evolution of the optical field is
governed by the quantum nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger equation (NLSE). Although this
kind of nonlinearity is quite general, we focus on a realistic implementation
involving cold atoms loaded in a hollow-core optical fiber, where the atomic
system provides a tunable nonlinearity that can be large even at a
single-photon level. In particular, we show that when the interaction between
photons is effectively repulsive, the transmission of multi-photon components
of the field is suppressed. This leads to anti-bunching of the transmitted
light and indicates that the system acts as a single-photon switch. On the
other hand, in the case of attractive interaction, the system can exhibit
either anti-bunching or bunching, which is in stark contrast to semiclassical
calculations. We show that the bunching behavior is related to the resonant

discretization spacing $\Delta$. Here we show that the method based on the
diagonalization of the short-time evolution operators leads to substantially
smaller discretization errors, vanishing exponentially with $1/\Delta^2$. As a
result, the presented calculation scheme is particularly well suited for
numerical studies of few-body quantum systems. The analytically derived
discretization errors estimates are numerically shown to hold for several
models. In the followup paper [1] we present and analyze substantial

short-time expansion of the propagator up to very high orders to calculate

It is a crucial open problem to unravel a replacement in such theories which is

that the singularity in the path integral, arising from the zero mode in the

This formal contradiction can be consistently overcome by the finite size

addition to causality, the following postulates have been considered: PFAITH
(existence of a pure preparationally faithful state), and FAITHE (existence of
a faithful effect). These postulates have exhibited an unexpected theoretical
power, excluding all known nonquantum probabilistic theories. Later in Ref. [2]
in addition to causality and PFAITH, postulate LDISCR (local discriminability)
and PURIFY (purifiability of all states) have been considered, narrowing the
probabilistic theory to something very close to Quantum Mechanics. In the
present paper we test the above postulates on some nonquantum probabilistic
models. The first model, &quot;the two-box world&quot; is an extension of the
Popescu-Rohrlich model, which achieves the greatest violation of the CHSH
inequality compatible with the no-signaling principle. The second model &quot;the

  structure of quantum mechanics</title><description>  Most quantum logics do not allow for a reasonable calculus of conditional
probability. However, those ones which do so provide a very general and rich
mathematical structure, including classical probabilities, quantum mechanics as
well as Jordan algebras. This structure exhibits some similarities with Alfsen
and Shultz's non-commutative spectral theory, but these two mathematical
approaches are not identical. Barnum, Emerson and Ududec adapted the concept of
higher-order interference, introduced by Sorkin in 1994, into a general
probabilistic framework. Their adaption is used here to reveal a close link
between the existence of the Jordan product and the non-existence of
interference of third or higher order in those quantum logics which entail a
reasonable calculus of conditional probability. The complete characterization
of the Jordan algebraic structure requires the following three further
postulates: a Hahn-Jordan decomposition property for the states, a polynomial
functional calculus for the observables, and the positivity of the square of an
observable. While classical probabilities are characterized by the absence of
any kind of interference, the absence of interference of third (and higher)
order thus characterizes a probability calculus which comes close to quantum
mechanics, but still includes the exceptional Jordan algebras.

usually demonstrated by three-level atomic or atom-like systems. In contrast to
the usual case, we theoretically study the EIT and EIA in an equivalent
three-level system, which is constructed by dressing a superconducting
two-level system (qubit) dressed by a single-mode cavity field. In this
equivalent system, we find that both the EIT and the EIA can be tuned by
controlling the level-spacing of the superconducting qubit and hence
controlling the dressed system. This tunability is due to the dressed
relaxation and dephasing rates which vary parametrically with the level-spacing
of the original qubit and thus affect the transition properties of the dressed
qubit and the susceptibility. These dressed relaxation and dephasing rates
characterize the reaction of the dressed qubit to an incident probe field. We
also use recent experimental data on superconducting qubits (charge, phase, and
flux qubits) to demonstrate our approach and show the possibility of
experimentally realizing this proposal.

same thermodynamics, i.e. the same energy spectrum. By performing exact
diagonalization, we investigate the behavior of pairwise and block entanglement

that pairwise entanglement fails in the characterization of the infinite-order

Entanglement entropy is then shown to be able to identify the quantum phase

  oracles</title><description>  We study the problem of identifying an n-bit string using a single quantum
query to an oracle that computes the Hamming distance between the query and
hidden strings. The standard action of the oracle on a response register of
dimension r is by powers of the cycle (1...r), all of which, of course,
commute. We introduce a new model for the action of an oracle--by general
permutations in S_r--and explore how the success probability depends on r and
on the map from Hamming distances to permutations. In particular, we prove that
when r = 2, for even n the success probability is 1 with the right choice of
the map, while for odd n the success probability cannot be 1 for any choice.
Furthermore, for small odd n and r = 3, we demonstrate numerically that the
image of the optimal map generates a non-abelian group of permutations.

  transparency. Influence of Doppler width</title><description>  The propagation of a pair of quantized fields inside a medium of three-level
atoms in $\Lambda$ configuration is analyzed. We calculate the stationary
quadrature noise spectrum of the field after propagating through the medium in
the case where the field has a general (but small) noise spectrum and the atoms
are in a coherent population trapping state and show electromagnetically
induced transparency (EIT). Although the mean values of the field remain
unaltered as the field propagates, there is an oscillatory interchange of noise
properties between the probe and pump fields. Also, as the field propagates,
there is an oscillatory creation and annihilation of correlations between the
probe and pump quadratures. We further study the field propagation of squeezed
states when there is two-photon resonance, but the field has a detuning
$\delta$ from atomic resonance. We show that the field propagation is very
sensitive to $\delta$. The propagation in this case can be explained as a
combination of a frequency dependent rotation of maximum squeezed quadrature
with an interchange of noise properties between pump and probe fields. It is
also shown that the effect of the Doppler width in a squeezed state propagation
is considerable.

This is why adiabatic quantum optimization has attracted so much attention, as
it provided a new approach to tackle NP-complete problems using a quantum
computer. The efficiency of this approach is limited by small spectral gaps
between the ground and excited states of the quantum computer's Hamiltonian. We
show that the statistics of the gaps can be analyzed in a novel way, borrowed
from the study of quantum disordered systems in statistical mechanics. It turns
out that due to a phenomenon similar to Anderson localization, exponentially
small gaps appear close to the end of the adiabatic algorithm for large random
instances of NP-complete problems. This implies that unfortunately, adiabatic
quantum optimization fails: the system gets trapped in one of the numerous
local minima.

method to train a strong binary classifier constructed as a thresholded sum
over weak classifiers. Our motivation was to cast the training of a classifier
into a format amenable to solution by the quantum adiabatic algorithm. Applying
adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) promises to yield solutions that are superior
to those which can be achieved with classical heuristic solvers. Interestingly
we found that by using heuristic solvers to obtain approximate solutions we
could already gain an advantage over the standard method AdaBoost. In this
communication we generalize the baseline method to large scale classifier
training. By large scale we mean that either the cardinality of the dictionary
of candidate weak classifiers or the number of weak learners used in the strong
classifier exceed the number of variables that can be handled effectively in a
single global optimization. For such situations we propose an iterative and
piecewise approach in which a subset of weak classifiers is selected in each
iteration via global optimization. The strong classifier is then constructed by
concatenating the subsets of weak classifiers. We show in numerical studies
that the generalized method again successfully competes with AdaBoost. We also
provide theoretical arguments as to why the proposed optimization method, which
does not only minimize the empirical loss but also adds L0-norm regularization,
is superior to versions of boosting that only minimize the empirical loss. By
conducting a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation we gather evidence that the quantum
adiabatic algorithm is able to handle a generic training problem efficiently.

  neither the classical physics</title><description>  The basic Leggett inequalities, i.e. those inequalities in which the
particular assumptions of Leggett's hidden-variable model (e.g. Malus law) were
not yet introduced, are usually derived using hidden-variable distributions of
probabilities (although in some cases completely general, positive
probabilities would lead to the same result). This fact creates sometimes the
illusion that these basic inequalities are a belonging of the hidden-variable
theories and are bound to contradict the quantum theory. In the present text
the basic Leggett inequalities are derived in the most general way, i.e. no
assumption is made that the distribution of probabilities would result from
some wave function, or from some set of classical variables. The consequence is
that as long as one and the same probability distribution is used in the
calculus of all the averages appearing in the basic Leggett inequalities, no
contradiction may occur. These inequalities may be violated only when different
averages are calculated with different distributions, for example, some of them
calculated with the quantum formalism and the others with some distribution of
classical parameters.

When quantum effects are significant, the future shows all the signs of quantum
weirdness, including duality, uncertainty, and entanglement. With the passage
of time, after the time-irreversible process of state-vector reduction has
taken place, the past emerges, with the previous quantum uncertainty replaced
by the classical certainty of definite particle identities and states. The
present time is where this transition largely takes place, but the process does
not take place uniformly: Evidence from delayed choice and related experiments
shows that isolated patches of quantum indeterminacy remain, and that their
transition from probability to certainty only takes place later. Thus, when
quantum effects are significant, the picture of a classical Evolving Block
Universe (`EBU') cedes place to one of a Crystallizing Block Universe (`CBU'),
which reflects this quantum transition from indeterminacy to certainty, while
nevertheless resembling the EBU on large enough scales.

an arbitrary element of the correlation function is expressed in a simple

by coupling it quadratically to a $\delta$-like potential, the strength of
which tends to infinity. Neumann conditions, on the other hand, require the
introduction of an even more singular term, which renders the reflection and
transmission coefficients ill-defined because of UV divergences. We present a
possible procedure to tame those divergences, by introducing a minimum length
scale, related to the non-zero `width' of a {\em nonlocal} term. We then use
this setup to reach (either exact or imperfect) Neumann conditions, by taking
the appropriate limits. After defining meaningful reflection coefficients, we
calculate the Casimir energies for flat parallel mirrors, presenting also the
extension of the procedure to the case of arbitrary surfaces. Finally, we
discuss briefly how to generalize the worldline approach to the nonlocal case,
what is potentially useful in order to compute Casimir energies in theories
containing nonlocal potentials; in particular, those which we use to reproduce
Neumann boundary conditions.

(Euclidean or flat) metric--that a generic (nine-dimensional) real two-qubit
system is separable, by implementing the well-known Peres-Horodecki test on the
partial transposes (PT's) of the associated 4 x 4 density matrices). But the
full implementation of the test--requiring that the determinant of the PT be
nonnegative for separability to hold--appears to be, at least presently,
computationally intractable. So, we have previously implemented--using the
auxiliary concept of a diagonal-entry-parameterized separability function
(DESF)--the weaker implied test of nonnegativity of the six 2 x 2 principal
minors of the PT. This yielded an exact upper bound on the separability
probability of 1024/{135 pi^2} =0.76854$. Here, we piece together
(reflection-symmetric) results obtained by requiring that each of the four 3 x
3 principal minors of the PT, in turn, be nonnegative, giving an
improved/reduced upper bound of 22/35 = 0.628571. Then, we conclude that a
still further improved upper bound of 1129/2100 = 0.537619 can be found by
similarly piecing together the (reflection-symmetric) results of enforcing the
simultaneous nonnegativity of certain pairs of the four 3 x 3 principal minors.
In deriving our improved upper bounds, we rely repeatedly upon the use of
certain integrals over cubes that arise. Finally, we apply an independence
assumption to a pair of DESF's that comes close to reproducing our numerical
estimate of the true separability function.

method uses three-level atoms coupled to amplitude modulated probe field and
spatially dependent drive field. The modulation of the probe field allows us to
tap into the steep dispersion normally associated with electromagnetically
induced transparency and offers an avenue to attain sub-nanometer resolution
using just optical fields. We illustrate application of the techniques to the
area of microscopy and lithography and show how multilevel schemes offer the
possibility of improving resolution further.

  of atoms</title><description>  The resonance fluorescence emitted by a system of two dipole-dipole
interacting nearby four-level atoms in J=1/2 - J=1/2 configuration is studied.
This setup is the simplest realistic model system which provides a complete
description of the (interatomic) dipole-dipole interaction for arbitrary
orientation of the interatomic distance vector, and at the same time allows for
intraatomic spontaneously generated coherences. We discuss different methods to
analyze the contribution of the various vacuum-induced coupling constants to
the total resonance fluorescence spectrum. These allow us to find a dressed
state interpretation of the contribution of the different interatomic
dipole-dipole couplings to the total spectrum. We further study the role of the
spontaneously generated coherences, and identify two different contributions to
the single-particle vacuum-induced couplings. We show that they have a
noticeable impact on the total resonance fluorescence spectrum down to small
interatomic distances, even though the dipole-dipole couplings constants then
are much larger in magnitude than the the single-particle coupling constants.
Interestingly, we find that the interatomic couplings can induce an effect of
the intraatomic spontaneously generated coherences on the observed spectra
which is not present in single-atom systems.

provides a possibility to represent averages of quantum observables, including
correlations of observables on subsystems of a composite system, as averages
with respect to fluctuations of classical random fields. PCSFT is a classical
model of the wave type. For example, &quot;electron&quot; is described by electronic
field. In contrast to QM, this field is a real physical field and not a field
of probabilities. An important point is that the prequantum field of e.g.
electron contains the irreducible contribution of the background field, vacuum
fluctuations. In principle, the traditional QM-formalism can be considered as a
special regularization procedure: subtraction of averages with respect to
vacuum fluctuations. In this paper we derive a classical analog of the
Heisenberg-Robertson inequality for dispersions of functionals of classical
(prequantum) fields. PCSFT Robertson-like inequality provides a restriction on
the product of classical dispersions. However, this restriction is not so rigid
as in QM. The quantum dispersion corresponds to the difference between e.g. the
electron field dispersion and the dispersion of vacuum fluctuations. Classical
Robertson-like inequality contains these differences. Hence, it does not imply
such a rigid estimate from below for dispersions as it was done in QM.

characterized by a set of parameters that vary only slowly under free
propagation. They specify bosonic ladder operators that connect modes of
different order, in analogy to the ladder operators connecting
harmonic-oscillator wave functions. The parameter spaces underlying sets of
higher-order modes are isomorphic to the parameter space of the ladder
operators. We study the geometry of this space and the geometric phase that
arises from it. This phase constitutes the ultimate generalization of the Gouy
phase in paraxial wave optics. It reduces to the ordinary Gouy phase and the
geometric phase of non-astigmatic optical modes with orbital angular momentum
states in limiting cases. We briefly discuss the well-known analogy between
geometric phases and the Aharonov-Bohm effect, which provides some
complementary insights in the geometric nature and origin of the generalized
Gouy phase shift. Our method also applies to the quantum-mechanical description
of wave packets. It allows for obtaining complete sets of normalized solutions
of the Schr\&quot;odinger equation. Cyclic transformations of such wave packets give
rise to a phase shift, which has a geometric interpretation in terms of the
other degrees of freedom involved.

  Space</title><description>  We investigate gravitational collapse of a $(3+1)$-dimensional BTZ black
string in AdS space in the context of both classical and quantum mechanics.
This is done by first deriving the conserved mass per unit length of the
cylindrically symmetric domain wall, which is taken as the classical
Hamiltonian of the black string. In the quantum mechanical context, we take
primary interest in the behavior of the collapse near the horizon and near the
origin (classical singularity) from the point of view of an infalling observer.
In the absence of radiation, quantum effects near the horizon do not change the
classical conclusions for an infalling observer, meaning that the horizon is
not an obstacle for him/her. The most interesting quantum mechanical effect
comes in when investigating near the origin. First, quantum effects are able to
remove the classical singularity at the origin, since the wave function is
non-singular at the origin. Second, the Schr\&quot;odinger equation describing the
behavior near the origin displays non-local effects, which depend on the energy
density of the domain wall. This is manifest in that derivatives of the
wavefunction at one point are related to the value of the wavefunction at some
other distant point.

capacitor paradox) is considered in a new, quantum discrete form. Simply
speaking we consider well-known usual, photoelectric effect experimental
device, i.e. photo electric cell, where cathode and anode are equivalently
charged but non-connected. It, obviously, represents a capacitor that
initially, i.e. before action of the photons with individual energy equivalent
to work function, holds corresponding energy of the electrical fields between
cathode and anode. Further, we direct quantum discretely photons, one by one,
toward cathode where according to photo-electrical effect electrons discretely,
one by one, will be emitted and directed toward anode. It causes discrete
discharge of the cell, i.e. capacitor and discrete decrease of the electrical
field. Finally, total discharge of the cell, i.e. capacitor, and total
disappearance of the electrical field and its energy will occur. Given,
seemingly paradoxical, capacitor total energy loss can be simply explained
without any dissipative effects (Joule heating or electromagnetic waves
emission can be neglected as high order small corrections) by work done by the
electrical field by movement of the electrons from cathode to anode.
(Remarkable two capacitors paradox can be, obviously, formulated and explained
in the completely analogous way.)

from the standard quantum circuit model. Here we introduce a model based on

Hermitian operator evolving under repeated application of a single random
unitary map, U_0. We show that while this single-parameter orbit in operator
space is not informationally complete, it can be used to yield surprisingly
high-fidelity reconstruction. For a d-dimensional Hilbert space with the
initial observable in su(d), the measurement record lacks information about a
matrix subspace of dimension &gt; d-2 out of the total dimension d^2-1. We
determine the conditions on U_0 such that the bound is saturated, and show they
are achieved by almost all pseudorandom unitary matrices. When we further
impose the constraint that the physical density matrix must be positive, we
obtain even higher fidelity than that predicted from the missing subspace. With
prior knowledge that the state is pure, the reconstruction will be perfect (in
the limit of vanishing noise) and for arbitrary mixed states, the fidelity is
over 0.96, even for small d, and reaching F &gt; 0.99 for d &gt; 9. We also study the
implementation of this protocol based on the relationship between random
matrices and quantum chaos. We show that the Floquet operator of the quantum

receiver. The two senders exploit both nonlocal and local quantum resources to
encode quantum information with local encoding circuits. They transmit their
encoded quantum data to a single receiver who then decodes the transmitted
quantum information. The nonlocal resources in a bipartite code are ebits and
nonlocal information qubits and the local resources are ancillas and local
information qubits. The technique of bipartite quantum error correction is
useful in both the quantum communication scenario described above and in
fault-tolerant quantum computation. It has application in fault-tolerant
quantum computation because we can prepare nonlocal resources offline and
exploit local encoding circuits. In particular, we derive an encoding circuit
for a bipartite version of the Steane code that is local and additionally
requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. We have simulated this encoding in
the CNOT extended rectangle with a publicly available fault-tolerant simulation
software. The result is that there is an improvement in the &quot;pseudothreshold&quot;

exact ground states in several parameter regimes, and study the composite
structures by using the generating function method generalized here to be
applicable to a mixture of two species of spinor gases. The most interesting
phase is the so-called entangled Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), which is
fragmented BEC with quantum entanglement between the two species, and with both
interspecies and intraspecies singlet pairs. For comparison, we also apply the
generating function method to a mixture of two species of pseudospin-1/2 atoms,
for which the total spin quantum number of each species is fixed as half of the
atom number, in contrast with the case of spin-1, for which it is a variable
determined by energetics. Consequently, singlet pairs in entangled BEC of a
pseudospin-1/2 mixture are all interspecies. Interspecies spin exchange leads
to novel features beyond those of spinor BEC of a single species of atoms as
well as mixtures without interspecies spin exchange.

laser using transitions in neutral praseodymium. Because of its five outer
electrons, this element shows a high density of energy levels leading to an
extremely line-rich excitation spectrum with more than 25000 known spectral
lines ranging from the UV to the infrared. We demonstrate the active frequency
stabilization of a diode laser on several praseodymium lines between 1105 and
1123 nm. The excitation signals were recorded in a hollow cathode lamp and
observed via laser-induced fluorescence. These signals are strong enough to
lock the diode laser onto most of the lines by using standard laser locking
techniques. In this way, the frequency drifts of the unlocked laser of more
than 30 MHz/h were eliminated and the laser frequency stabilized to within
1.4(1) MHz for averaging times &gt;0.2 s. Frequency quadrupling the stabilized
diode laser can produce frequency-stable UV-light in the range from 276 to 281
nm. In particular, using a strong hyperfine component of the praseodymium
excitation line E = 16 502.616_7/2 cm^-1 -&gt; E' = 25 442.742_9/2 cm^-1 at lambda

of quantum channels exhibits an extreme form of non-additivity, one which is
not possible for classical channels, or even for the usual capacities of
quantum channels. By combining probabilistic arguments with algebraic geometry,
we prove that there exist channels E1 and E2 with no zero-error classical
capacity whatsoever, C_0(E1) = C_0(E2) = 0, but whose joint zero-error quantum
capacity is positive, Q_0(E1 x E2) &gt;= 1. This striking effect is an extreme
from of the superactivation phenomenon, as it implies that both the classical

simultaneously, whilst being a strictly stronger property of capacities.
Superactivation of the quantum zero-error capacity was not previously known.

  mechanical oscillator</title><description>  Quantum fluctuations in the radiation pressure of light can excite stochastic
motions of mechanical oscillators thereby realizing a linear quantum
opto-mechanical coupling. When performing a precise measurement of the position
of an oscillator, this coupling results in quantum radiation pressure noise. Up
to now this effect has not been observed yet. Generally speaking, the strength
of radiation pressure noise increases when the effective mass of the oscillator
is decreased or when the power of the reflected light is increased. Recently,
extremely light SiN membranes with high mechanical Q-values at room temperature
have attracted attention as low thermal noise mechanical oscillators. However,
the power reflectance of these membranes is much lower than unity which makes
the use of advanced interferometer recycling techniques to amplify the
radiation pressure noise in a standard Michelson interferometer inefficient.
Here, we propose and theoretically analyze a Michelson-Sagnac interferometer
that includes the membrane as a common end mirror for the Michelson
interferometer part. In this new topology, both, power- and signal-recycling
can be used even if the reflectance of the membrane is much lower than unity.
In particular, signal-recycling is a useful tool because it does not involve a
power increase at the membrane. We derive the formulas for the quantum
radiation pressure noise and the shot-noise of an oscillator position
measurement and compare them with theoretical models of the thermal noise of a
SiN membrane with a fundamental resonant frequency of 75 kHz and an effective
mass of 125 ng. We find that quantum radiation pressure noise should be
observable with a power of 1 W at the central beam splitter of the
interferometer and a membrane temperature of 1 K.

approximate and exact solutions exist for systems in equilibrium, examples of
non-equilibrium dynamics of many-body systems, which allow reliable theoretical
analysis, are few and far between. In this paper we discuss a broad class of
time-dependent interacting systems subject to external linear and parabolic

both local and nonlocal interactions and derive appropriate self-consistency

mechanics could be regarded as incomplete. Firstly, the principle of linear
superposition has not been experimentally tested for position eigenstates of
objects having more than about a thousand atoms. Secondly, there is no
universally agreed upon explanation for the process of quantum measurement.
Thirdly, there is no universally agreed upon explanation for the observed fact
that macroscopic objects are not found in superposition of position
eigenstates. Fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, the concept of time is
classical and hence external to quantum mechanics : there should exist an
equivalent reformulation of the theory which does not refer to an external
classical time. In this paper we argue that such a reformulation is the
limiting case of a nonlinear quantum theory, with the nonlinearity becoming
important at the Planck mass scale. Such a nonlinearity can provide insights
into the problems mentioned above. We use a physically motivated model for a
nonlinear Schrodinger equation to show that nonlinearity can help in
understanding quantum measurement. We also show that while the principle of
linear superposition holds to a very high accuracy for atomic systems, the
lifetime of a quantum superposition becomes progressively smaller, as one goes
from microscopic to macroscopic objects. This can explain the observed absence
of position superpositions in macroscopic objects [lifetime is too small]. It
also suggests that ongoing laboratory experiments maybe able to detect the
finite superposition lifetime for mesoscopic objects, in the foreseeable
future.

the output state under the Born approximation using a Gaussian localized

coherent control of the output channels. The robustness of this approximation
is studied by comparing the stationary scattering theory to numerical

weak localized potential that is achievable experimentally. We infer a possible

Then, we detail the non-perturbative regime of the interaction of the guided

principles provide strong constraints on interpretations. They imply the
particle-like properties of mass, energy, momentum, spin, charge, and locality
are actually properties of the wave function, and this in turn implies there is
no evidence for the existence of particles. In addition, there is currently no
experimental evidence for collapse, and a theory of collapse encounters
significant hurdles. Further, the probability law is found to rule out the
many-worlds interpretation, so all three major interpretations encounter
serious to fatal problems. An interpretation which conforms to all the

physical interaction what is the minimum time for reaching a target entangled
state? We show that the minimum time is inversely proportional to the quantum
mechanical uncertainty in the non-local Hamiltonian. We find that the presence
of initial entanglement helps to minimize the waiting time. Furthermore, we
find that in a bi-local rotating frame the entangling capability is actually a
geometric quantity. We give an universal bound for the time average of
entanglement rate for general quantum systems. The time average of entanglement
rate does not depend on the particular Hamiltonian, rather on the fluctuation
in the Hamiltonian. There can be infinite number of nonlocal Hamiltonians which
may give same average entanglement rate. We also prove a composition law for
minimum time when the system evolves under a composite Hamiltonian.

  Dielectric Constant, the Spontaneous Emission and the Zero-Temperature
  Electromagnetic Pressure</title><description>  We study from a critical perspective several quantum-electrodynamic phenomena
commonly related to vacuum electromagnetic (EM) fluctuations in complex media.
We compute the resonance-shift, the spontaneous emission rate, the local
density of states and the van-der-Waals-Casimir pressure in a dielectric medium
using a microscopic diagrammatic approach. We find, in agreement with some
recent works, that these effects cannot be attributed to variations on the
energy of the EM vacuum but to variations of the dielectric self-energy. This
energy is the result of the interaction of the bare polarizability of the
dielectric constituents with the EM fluctuations of an actually polarized
vacuum. We have found an exact expression for the spectrum of these
fluctuations in a statistically homogeneous dielectric. Those fluctuations turn
out to be different to the ones of normal radiative modes. It is the latter
that carry the zero-point-energy (ZPE). Concerning spontaneous emission, we
clarify the nature of the radiation and the origin of the so-called local field
factors. Essential discrepancies are found with respect to previous works. We
perform a detailed analysis of the phenomenon of radiative and non-radiative
energy transfer. Analytical formulae are given for the decay rate of an
interstitial impurity in a Maxwell-Garnett dielectric and for the decay rate of
a substantial impurity sited in a large cavity. The construction of the
effective dielectric constant is found to be a self-consistency problem. The
van-der-Waals pressure in a complex medium is computed in terms of variations
of the dielectric self-energy at zero-temperature. An additional radiative
pressure appears associated to variations of the EM vacuum energy.

that singlets between arbitrary nodes in such networks can be created if and

generalize the method of entanglement percolation, previously developed for
pure states, to mixed states of this form. As part of this, we find and compare
different distillation protocols necessary to convert groups of mixed states
shared between neighboring nodes of the network into singlets. In addition, we
discuss protocols that only rely on local rules for the efficient connection of
two remote nodes in the network via entanglement swapping. Further improvements
of the success probability of singlet generation are developed by using
particular forms of `quantum preprocessing' on the network. This includes
generalized forms of entanglement swapping and we show how such strategies can

that can correct errors by an exhaustive search of different error patterns,
similar to the way that we decode classical non-linear codes. For an n-qubit
quantum code correcting errors on up to t qubits, this brute-force approach
consecutively tests different errors of weight t or less, and employs a
separate n-qubit measurement in each test. In this paper, we suggest an error
grouping technique that allows to simultaneously test large groups of errors in
a single measurement. This structured error recovery technique exponentially
reduces the number of measurements by about 3^t times. While it still leaves
exponentially many measurements for a generic CWS code, the technique is
equivalent to syndrome-based recovery for the special case of additive CWS
codes.

opportunity to establish a direct link between experiment and generic models
which capture the underlying physics. A fundamental concept to describe the
collective matter-light interaction is the Dicke model which has been predicted
to show an intriguing quantum phase transition. Here we realize the Dicke
quantum phase transition in an open system formed by a Bose-Einstein condensate
coupled to an optical cavity, and observe the emergence of a self-organized
supersolid phase. The phase transition is driven by infinitely long-ranged
interactions between the condensed atoms. These are induced by two-photon
processes involving the cavity mode and a pump field. We show that the phase
transition is described by the Dicke Hamiltonian, including counter-rotating
coupling terms, and that the supersolid phase is associated with a
spontaneously broken spatial symmetry. The boundary of the phase transition is
mapped out in quantitative agreement with the Dicke model. The work opens the

through a repulsive square barrier by solving analytically the one dimensional
Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The barrier height and width fix the current-phase
relation $j(\delta\phi)$, which tends to $j\sim\cos(\delta\phi/2)$ for weak
barriers and to the Josephson sinusoidal relation $j\sim\sin(\delta\phi)$ for
strong barriers. Between these two limits, the current-phase relation depends
on the barrier width. In particular, for wide enough barriers, we observe two
families of multivalued current-phase relations. Diagrams belonging to the
first family, already known in the literature, can have two different positive
values of the current at the same phase difference. The second family, new to
our knowledge, can instead allow for three different positive currents still
corresponding to the same phase difference. Finally, we show that the
multivalued behavior arises from the competition between hydrodynamic and
nonlinear-dispersive components of the flow, the latter due to the presence of
a soliton inside the barrier region.

character of quantum mechanics does not originate from uncertainties caused by
the process of measurement or observation, but rather reflects the presence of
objectively existing vacuum fluctuations whose action on massive particles is
calibrated by Planck's constant and effects an additional irregular motion. We
describe a one-particle system by introducing two equally large sub-ensembles
for each of which one obtains an equation of motion that has the form of a
Navier-Stokes- or ''anti''-Navier-Stokes-type equation, respectively. By
averaging over the total ensemble one obtains a new equation of motion which
can be converted into the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. The concept
allows the inclusion of electromagnetic fields and can be extended to
interacting N-particle systems. We analyze the problem of how an experimental
setup can consistently be decomposed into the quantum system under study and
the residual quantum system ''apparatus''. The irregular extra motion of the
particle under study allows a decomposition of the associated ensemble into two
sub-ensembles the members of which perform, respectively, a right-handed or
left-handed irregular circular motion about a given axis which becomes
physically relevant in the presence of a magnetic field. We demonstrate that
this orientation-decomposed ''Zitterbewegung'' behaves - in accordance with
Schroedinger's original idea - as a spin-type angular momentum which appears in
addition to a possible orbital angular moment of the particle. We derive the
non-relativistic time-dependent Pauli equation and propose a theory of the
Stern-Gerlach experiment. The Dirac equation can be derived similarly.

complementary. We determine the marginal observables of a covariant phase space
observable with respect to an arbitrary rotated reference frame, and observe
that these marginal observables are unsharp quadrature observables. The related
distributions constitute the Radon tranform of a phase space distribution of
the covariant phase space observable. Since the quadrature distributions are
the Radon transform of the Wigner function of a state, we also exhibit the
relation between the quadrature observables and the tomography observable, and
show how to construct the phase space observable from the quadrature
observables. Finally, we give a method to measure together with a single
measurement scheme any complementary pair of quadrature observables.

the existence of single photons traveling along the line with finite speed, our

one region, entanglement may only arise due to correlated vacuum fluctuations,
while in the other the contribution from exchanged photons shows up.

confined in optical lattices have led to numerous theoretical proposals devoted
to the quantum simulation of problems e.g. known from condensed matter physics.
Many of those ideas demand for experimental environments with non-cubic lattice
geometries. In this paper we report on the implementation of a versatile
three-beam lattice allowing for the generation of triangular as well as
hexagonal optical lattices. As an important step the superfluid-Mott insulator
(SF-MI) quantum phase transition has been observed and investigated in detail
in this lattice geometry for the first time. In addition to this we study the
physics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in the presence of the
triangular optical lattice potential, especially spin changing dynamics across
the SF-MI transition. Our results suggest that below the SF-MI phase
transition, a well-established mean-field model describes the observed data
when renormalizing the spin-dependent interaction. Interestingly this opens new
perspectives for a lattice driven tuning of a spin dynamics resonance occurring
through the interplay of quadratic Zeeman effect and spin-dependent
interaction. We finally discuss further lattice configurations which can be
realized with our setup.

  via operationally local transformations</title><description>  Recently, it was demonstrated by Son et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{102},
110404 (2009), that a separable bipartite continuous variable quantum system
can violate the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality via operationally
local transformations. Operationally local transformations are parameterized
only by local variables, however in order to allow violation of the CHSH
inequality a maximally entangled ancilla was necessary. The use of the
entangled ancilla in this scheme caused the state under test to become
dependent on the measurement choice one uses to calculate the CHSH inequality
thus violating one of the assumptions used in deriving a Bell inequality,
namely the `free will' or `statistical independence' assumption. The novelty in
this scheme however is that the measurement settings can be external free
parameters. In this paper we generalize these operationally local
transformations for multipartite Bell inequalities (with dichotomic
observables) and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for violation
within this scheme. Namely, a violation of a multipartite Bell inequality in
this setting is contingent on whether an ancillary system admits any realistic,
local hidden variable model i.e. whether the ancilla violates the given Bell
inequality. These results indicate that violation of a Bell inequality
performed on a system does not necessarily imply that the system is nonlocal.
In fact the system under test may be completely classical. However, nonlocality
must have resided somewhere, this may have been in the environment, the
physical variables used to manipulate the system or the detectors themselves
provided the measurement settings are external free variables.

for the deviation density matrix an expression for the relaxing initial pure

product state with all atoms in the same, but otherwise arbitrary
single-particle state. We apply our description to two different kinds of spin
squeezing: (i) when each spin-F atom is individually squeezed without creating
interatomic entanglement and (ii) when a particular collective atomic
oscillator mode is squeezed via quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement and
feedback. When combined in sequence, the order of the two methods is relevant
in the final degree of squeezing. We also discuss the role of the two kinds of
squeezing when multi-sublevel atoms are used as quantum memories for light.

  NOON-state fidelity</title><description>  &quot;Schrodinger's cat&quot; is a gedankenexperiment intended to highlight conceptual
difficulties in the interpretation of quantum mechanics. The generation of
'cat-like' states is central to numerous quantum information protocols. In
particular, much attention has been drawn by states containing N photons in a
superposition of all being in one of two designated modes. These maximally path
entangled states, known as 'NOON' states, exhibit enhanced phase sensitivity
and allow reaching the fundamental quantum limit of precision measurement. Such
states could also be used for obtaining 'super-resolution' in quantum
lithography. Creation of NOON states in the lab, has been limited to N=3.
Surpassing this has proven a formidable experimental challenge. Here, we
realize a scheme for generation of high fidelity NOON states with arbitrarily
large N. We demonstrate the versatility of the scheme by measuring up to N=5 in
a single setup, this is in contrast to previous experiments which were
custom-designed for a specific N. The scheme is based on high order
interference between 'quantum' down-converted light and 'classical' coherent
light in the photon number basis. Our results verify the high degree of path
entanglement which emerges naturally from the interference of two ubiquitous,
easy to generate, states of light.

Accordingly the review is divided into two parts. The first part revolves

excitation of a gapless many-body system scales with a power of the driving

resources required by this method to approximate an open system coupled to an
infinite bath, we simulate a weakly damped system and compare to the evolution
given by the relevant Markovian master equation. We obtain the Markovian

spontaneously broken in exactly the same way. The order associated with this
form of spontaneous symmetry breaking is characterised by the emergence of
quantum state reduction: systems which spontaneously break time translation
symmetry act as ideal measurement machines. In this review the breaking of time
translation symmetry is first compared to that of other symmetries such as
spatial translations and rotations. It is then discussed how broken time
translation symmetry gives rise to the process of quantum state reduction and
how it generates a pointer basis, Born's rule, etc. After a comparison between
this model and alternative approaches to the problem of quantum state

The $n$ two-qubit controlled-phase gates, forming this multiqubit phase gate,

independent of the number $n$ of qubits. This phase gate controlling at once
$n$ qubits is insensitive to the initial state of the cavity mode and can be

based on tuning the qubit frequency while the other method tunes the resonator
frequency. Using superconducting qubits coupled to a resonator as an example,
we show how to implement the proposed gate with one superconducting qubit
simultaneously controlling $n$ qubits selected from $N$ qubits coupled to a

The problem to define a Lorentz invariant stochastic dynamics for the

orthogonal to the deterministic, unitary time evolution inside the

(2009)] we have shown the possibility to achieve strong coupling of the
quantized motion of a micron-sized mechanical system to the motion of a single
trapped atom. In the proposed setup the coherent coupling between a SiN
membrane and a single atom is mediated by the field of a high finesse cavity,
and can be much larger than the relevant decoherence rates. This makes the
well-developed tools of CQED (cavity quantum electrodynamics) with single atoms
available in the realm of cavity optomechanics. In this paper we elaborate on
this scheme and provide detailed derivations and technical comments. Moreover,
we give numerical as well as analytical results for a number of possible
applications for transfer of squeezed or Fock states from atom to membrane as
well as entanglement generation, taking full account of dissipation. In the
limit of strong-coupling the preparation and verification of non-classical
states of a mesoscopic mechanical system is within reach.

nonrelativistic potential scattering we investigate new variational
approximations in this framework. By means of the Feynman-Jensen variational
principle and the most general ansatz quadratic in the velocity variables --
over which one has to integrate functionally -- we obtain variational equations
which contain classical elements (trajectories) as well as quantum-mechanical
ones (wave spreading).We analyse these equations and solve them numerically by

Comparison is made with exact partial-wave results for scattering from a
Gaussian potential and better agreement is found at large scattering angles
where the standard eikonal-type approximations fail.

one-dimensional systems. For two body collisions excitations of transverse
modes are the prerequisite for energy exchange and thermalzation. At very low
temperatures excitations of transverse modes are exponentially suppressed,
thermalization by two body collisions stops and the system should become
integrable. In quantum mechanics virtual excitations of higher radial modes are
possible. These virtually excited radial modes give rise to effective
three-body velocity-changing collisions which lead to thermalization. We show
that these three-body elastic interactions are suppressed by pairwise quantum
correlations when approaching the strongly correlated regime. If the relative
momentum $k$ is small compared to the two-body coupling constant $c$ the
three-particle scattering state is suppressed by a factor of $(k/c)^{12}$,
which is proportional to $\gamma ^{12}$, that is to the square of the
three-body correlation function at zero distance in the limit of the
Lieb-Liniger parameter $\gamma \gg 1$. This demonstrates that in one
dimensional quantum systems it is not the freeze-out of two body collisions but
the strong quantum correlations which ensures absence of thermalization on
experimentally relevant time scales.

Hamiltonian of electrons in a d-dimensional space. The electrons interact via
the Coulomb potential. In the case of atoms (d=3), the electrons are attracted
by the nucleus, via the Coulomb potential. In the case of quantum dots (d=2),
the electrons are confined by an external potential, whose shape can be varied.
We show that the dominant terms of the ground state energy are those given by a
semiclassical Hartree-exchange energy, whose N to infinity limit corresponds to
Thomas-Fermi theory. This semiclassical Hartree-exchange theory creates
oscillations in the ground state energy as a function of N. These oscillations
reflect the dynamics of a classical particle moving in the presence of the
Thomas-Fermi potential. The dynamics is regular for atoms and some dots, but in
general in the case of dots, the motion contains a chaotic component. We
compute the correlation effects. They appear at the order N ln N for atoms, in

of operationally understood circuits is laid out. Circuits are comprised of
operations and wires. An operation is one use of an apparatus and a wire is a
diagrammatic device for showing how apertures on the apparatuses are placed
next to each other. Mathematical objects are defined in terms of the circuit
understood graphically. In particular, we do not think of the circuit as
sitting in a background time. Circuits can be foliated by hypersurfaces
comprised of sets of wires. Systems are defined to be associated with wires. A
closable set of operations is defined to be one for which the probability
associated with any circuit built from this set is independent both of choices
on other circuits and of extra circuitry that may be added to outputs from this
circuit. States can be associated with circuit fragments corresponding to
preparations. These states evolve on passing through circuit fragments
corresponding to transformations. The composition of transformations is
treated. A number of theorems are proven including one which rules out
quaternionic quantum theory. The case of locally tomographic theories (where
local measurements on a systems components suffice to determine the global
state) is considered. For such theories the probability can be calculated for a
circuit from matrices pertaining the operations that comprise that circuit.
Classical probability theory and quantum theory are exhibited as examples in
this framework.

nonclassical properties. We finally discuss some questions related to the
possible experimental observation of the nonclassical states and the effect of
decoherence.

consider the winning non-transitive strategies R, S and P such as R beats S, S
beats P, and P beats R. The game behaves as a noiseless game for maximum value
of the quantum noise parameter. It is seen that Alice's payoff is heavily
influenced by the depolarizing noise as compared to the amplitude damping
noise. Depolarizing channel causes a monotonic decrease in players payoffs as
we increase the amount of of quantum noise. In case of amplitude damping
channel, the Alice's payoff function reaches its minimum for alpha=0.5 and is
symmetrical. This means that larger values of quantum noise influence the game
weakly. On the other hand, phase damping channel does not influence the game's
payoff. Furthermore, the game's Nash equilibrium and non-transitive character
of the game are not affected under the influence of quantum noise.

chemical processes on the atomic and molecular scale. This work presents a
perspective of progress in the field of control over quantum phenomena, tracing
the evolution of theoretical concepts and experimental methods from early
developments to the most recent advances. The current experimental successes
would be impossible without the development of intense femtosecond laser
sources and pulse shapers. The two most critical theoretical insights were (1)
realizing that ultrafast atomic and molecular dynamics can be controlled via
manipulation of quantum interferences and (2) understanding that optimally
shaped ultrafast laser pulses are the most effective means for producing the
desired quantum interference patterns in the controlled system. Finally, these
theoretical and experimental advances were brought together by the crucial
concept of adaptive feedback control, which is a laboratory procedure employing
measurement-driven, closed-loop optimization to identify the best shapes of
femtosecond laser control pulses for steering quantum dynamics towards the
desired objective. Optimization in adaptive feedback control experiments is
guided by a learning algorithm, with stochastic methods proving to be
especially effective. Adaptive feedback control of quantum phenomena has found
numerous applications in many areas of the physical and chemical sciences, and
this paper reviews the extensive experiments. Other subjects discussed include
quantum optimal control theory, quantum control landscapes, the role of
theoretical control designs in experimental realizations, and real-time quantum
feedback control. The paper concludes with a prospective of open research
directions that are likely to attract significant attention in the future.

quantum computation, which is based on the cluster model of encoded qubits. In
this cluster-based architecture, concatenated computation is implemented in a
quite different way from the usual circuit-based architecture where physical
gates are recursively replaced by logical gates with error-correction gadgets.
Instead, some relevant cluster states, say fundamental clusters, are
recursively constructed through verification and postselection in advance for
the higher-level one-way computation, which namely provides error-precorrection
of gate operations. A suitable code such as the Steane seven-qubit code is
adopted for transversal operations. This concatenated construction of verified
fundamental clusters has a simple transversal structure of logical errors, and
achieves a high noise threshold ~ 3 % for computation by using appropriate
verification procedures. Since the postselection is localized within each
fundamental cluster with the help of deterministic bare controlled-Z gates
without verification, divergence of resources is restrained, which reconciles
postselection with scalability.

the original quantum system: either identify the state successfully or distill
some pure entanglement. Remarkably, if many copies are available, we show that
any finite set of entangled pure states, whatever orthogonal or not, can be
locally distinguished in this way, which further implies that pure entanglement

eigenstates of the corresponding linear Hamiltonian. The equation leads to the
usual continuity equation and thus maintains the unitarity of the wave
function. For the non-stationary solutions, numerical calculations are carried
out for the one-dimensional infinite square-well potential and for several
time-dependent potentials that tend to the former as time increases. Results
show that for various initial states, the wave function always evolves into
some eigenstate of the corresponding linear Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional
infinite square-well potential. For a small time-dependent perturbation

This nonlinear Schrodinger equation thus presents the state evolution similar

  information processing</title><description>  On the basis of introspective analysis, we establish a crucial requirement
for the physical computation basis of consciousness: it should allow processing
a significant amount of information together at the same time. Classical
computation does not satisfy the requirement. At the fundamental physical
level, it is a network of two body interactions, each the input-output
transformation of a universal Boolean gate. Thus, it cannot process together at
the same time more than the three bit input of this gate - many such gates in
parallel do not count since the information is not processed together. Quantum
computation satisfies the requirement. At the light of our recent explanation
of the speed up, quantum measurement of the solution of the problem is
analogous to a many body interaction between the parts of a perfect classical
machine, whose mechanical constraints represent the problem to be solved. The
many body interaction satisfies all the constraints together at the same time,
producing the solution in one shot. This shades light on the physical
computation level of the theories that place consciousness in quantum
measurement and explains how informations coming from disparate sensorial
channels come together in the unity of subjective experience. The fact that the
fundamental mechanism of consciousness is the same of the quantum speed up,
gives quantum consciousness a potentially enormous evolutionary advantage.

which one can {\em almost} derive the appratus of finite dimensional quantum
theory. Stated informally, these require that systems appear completely
classical as restricted to a single measurement, that different measurements,
and likewise different pure states, be equivalent (up to the action of a
compact group of symmetries), and that every state be the marginal of a
bipartite non-signaling state perfectly correlating two measurements.
  This much yields a mathematical representation of measurements and states
that is already very suggestive of quantum mechanics. In particular, in any
theory satisfying these axioms, measurements can be represented by orthonormal
subsets of, and states, by vectors in, an ordered real Hilbert space -- in the
quantum case, the space of Hermitian operators, with its usual tracial inner
product. One final postulate (a simple minimization principle, still in need of
a clear interpretation) forces the positive cone of this space to be
homogeneous and self-dual and hence, to be the the state space of a formally
real Jordan algebra. From here, the route to the standard framework of
finite-dimensional quantum mechanics is quite short.

biological systems to standard tests or measures of quantumness. These tests
and measures should elucidate if non-trivial quantum effects may be present in
biological systems. Two such measures of quantum correlations are the quantum
discord and the relative entropy of entanglement. Here, we show that the
relative entropy of entanglement admits a simple analytic form when dynamics
and accessible degrees of freedom are restricted to a zero- and
single-excitation subspace. We also simulate and calculate the amount of
quantum discord that is present in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson protein complex
during the transfer of an excitation from a chlorosome antenna to a reaction
center. We find that the single-excitation quantum discord and relative entropy
of entanglement are equal for all of our numerical simulations, but a proof of
their general equality for this setting evades us for now. Also, some of our
simulations demonstrate that the relative entropy of entanglement without the
single-excitation restriction is much lower than the quantum discord. The first
picosecond of dynamics is the relevant timescale for the transfer of the
excitation, according to some sources in the literature. Our simulation results
indicate that quantum correlations contribute a significant fraction of the
total correlation during this first picosecond in many cases, at both cryogenic

applications, where side information about the values taken by classical random

particularly relevant in the context of cryptography, where an adversary may
make use of quantum devices. Here, we show that the well known construction
paradigm for extractors proposed by Trevisan is sound in the presence of
quantum side information.
  We exploit the modularity of this paradigm to give several concrete extractor
constructions, which, e.g, extract all the conditional (smooth) min-entropy of

  Theories</title><description>  In any probabilistic theory, we may say a bipartite state on a composite
system AB steers its marginal state (on, say, system B) if, for any
decomposition of the marginal as a mixture, with probabilities p_i, of states
b_i of B, there exists an observable a_i on A such that the states of B
conditional on getting outcome a_i on A, are exactly the states b_i, and the
probabilities of outcomes a_i are p_i. This is always so for pure bipartite
states in quantum mechanics, a fact first observed by Schroedinger in 1935.
Here, we show that, for weakly self-dual state spaces (those isomorphic, but
perhaps not canonically isomorphic, to their dual spaces), the assumption that
every state of a system A is steered by some bipartite state of a composite AA
consisting of two copies of A, amounts to the homogeneity of the state cone. If
the state space is actually self-dual, and not just weakly so, this implies
(via the Koecher-Vinberg Theorem) that it is the self-adjoint part of a
formally real Jordan algebra, and hence, quite close to being quantum
mechanical.

algorithms whose queries to the input do not depend on the result of previous
queries. First, we show that any bounded-error nonadaptive quantum query
algorithm that computes some total boolean function depending on n variables
must make Omega(n) queries to the input in total. Second, we show that, if
there exists a quantum algorithm that uses k nonadaptive oracle queries to
learn which one of a set of m boolean functions it has been given, there exists
a nonadaptive classical algorithm using O(k log m) queries to solve the same
problem. Thus, in the nonadaptive setting, quantum algorithms can achieve at
most a very limited speed-up over classical query algorithms.

  properties of coherent light beam</title><description>  We present direct measurement of Kirkwood-Rihaczek (KR) distribution for
spatial properties of coherent light beam in terms of position and momentum
(angle) coordinates. We employ a two-local oscillator (LO) balanced heterodyne
detection (BHD) to simultaneously extract distribution of transverse position
and momentum of a light beam. The two-LO BHD could measure KR distribution for
any complex wave field (including quantum mechanical wave function) without
applying tomography methods (inverse Radon transformation). Transformation of
KR distribution to Wigner, Glauber Sudarshan P- and Husimi or Q- distributions
in spatial coordinates are illustrated through experimental data. The direct
measurement of KR distribution could provide local information of wave field,
which is suitable for studying particle properties of a quantum system. While
Wigner function is suitable for studying wave properties such as interference,
and hence provides nonlocal information of the wave field. The method developed
here can be used for exploring spatial quantum state for quantum mapping and
computing, optical phase space imaging for biomedical applications.

quantum) channel is used to simulate a noiseless one, reverse Shannon theorems
concern the use of noiseless channels to simulate noisy ones, and more
generally the use of one noisy channel to simulate another. For channels of
nonzero capacity, this simulation is always possible, but for it to be
efficient, auxiliary resources of the proper kind and amount are generally
required. In the classical case, shared randomness between sender and receiver
is a sufficient auxiliary resource, regardless of the nature of the source, but
in the quantum case the requisite auxiliary resources for efficient simulation
depend on both the channel being simulated, and the source from which the
channel inputs are coming. For tensor power sources (the quantum generalization
of classical IID sources), entanglement in the form of standard ebits
(maximally entangled pairs of qubits) is sufficient, but for general sources,
which may be arbitrarily correlated or entangled across channel inputs,
additional resources, such as entanglement-embezzling states or backward
communication, are generally needed. Combining existing and new results, we
establish the amounts of communication and auxiliary resources needed in both
the classical and quantum cases, the tradeoffs among them, and the loss of
simulation efficiency when auxiliary resources are absent or insufficient. In
particular we find a new single-letter expression for the excess forward
communication cost of coherent feedback simulations of quantum channels (i.e.
simulations in which the sender retains what would escape into the environment
in an ordinary simulation), on non-tensor-power sources in the presence of
unlimited ebits but no other auxiliary resource. Our results on tensor power
sources establish a strong converse to the entanglement-assisted capacity
theorem.

  Measurements</title><description>  Examples of symmetric informationally complete positive operator valued
measures (SIC-POVMs) have been constructed in every dimension less than or
equal to 67. However, it remains an open question whether they exist in all
finite dimensions. A SIC-POVM is usually thought of as a highly symmetric
structure in quantum state space. However, its elements can equally well be
regarded as a basis for the Lie algebra gl(d,C). In this paper we examine the
resulting structure constants, which are calculated from the traces of the
triple products of the SIC-POVM elements and which, it turns out, characterize
the SIC-POVM up to unitary equivalence. We show that the structure constants
have numerous remarkable properties. In particular we show that the existence
of a SIC-POVM in dimension d is equivalent to the existence of a certain
structure in the adjoint representation of gl(d,C). We hope that transforming
the problem in this way, from a question about quantum state space to a
question about Lie algebras, may help to make the existence problem tractable.

proposals of hybrid computation by S. Lloyd and P. van Loock et. al. The model
is based on two observations made about both the discrete and continuous
algorithms already available. First, the Fourier transform is a single-step
operation in a continuous-variable (CV) setting. Additionally, any
implementation of the oracle is nontrivial in both schemes. The steps of the
computation are very similar to those in the CV algorithm, with the main
difference being the way in which the qunats, or quantum units of analogic
information, and the qubits interact in the oracle. Using both discrete and
continuous states of light, linear devices, and photo-detection, an optical
implementation of the oracle is proposed. For simplicity, infinitely squeezed
states are used in the continuous register, whereas the optical qubit is
encoded in the dual-rail logic of the KLM protocol. The initial assumption of
ideal states as qunats will be dropped to study the effects of finite squeezing
in the quality of the computation.

that takes advantage of a quantum sensor's environment to amplify its response
to weak external perturbations. An individual qubit is used to sense the
dynamics of surrounding ancillary qubits, which are in turn affected by the
external field to be measured. The resulting sensitivity enhancement is
determined by the number of ancillas that are coupled strongly to the sensor
qubit; it does not depend on the exact values of the coupling strengths and is
resilient to many forms of decoherence. The method achieves nearly
Heisenberg-limited precision measurement, using a novel class of entangled
states. We discuss specific applications to improve clock sensitivity using
trapped ions and magnetic sensing based on electronic spins in diamond.

  two-dimensional superfluids following a quantum quench</title><description>  We study the dynamics of the relative phase of a bilayer of two-dimensional
superfluids after the two superfluids have been decoupled. We find that on
short time scales the relative phase shows &quot;light cone&quot; like dynamics and
creates a metastable superfluid state, which can be supercritical. We also
demonstrate similar light cone dynamics for the transverse field Ising model.
On longer time scales the supercritical state relaxes to a disordered state due
to dynamical vortex unbinding. This scenario of dynamically suppressed vortex
proliferation constitutes a reverse-Kibble-Zurek effect. We study this effect
both numerically using truncated Wigner approximation and analytically within a
newly suggested time dependent renormalization group approach (RG). In
particular, within RG we show that there are two possible fixed points for the
real time evolution corresponding to the superfluid and normal steady states.
So depending on the initial conditions and the microscopic parameters of the
Hamiltonian the system undergoes a non-equilibrium phase transition of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless type. The time scales for the vortex unbinding near the
critical point are exponentially divergent, similar to the equilibrium case.

TG gas in an external magnetic field. When the number of bosons $N$ is
commensurate with the number of potential cycles $M$, the probability of this
TG gas in the ground state is bigger than the TG gas raised by Girardeau in
1960. Through the comparison of properties between this TG gas and Fermi gas,
we find that the following issues are always of the same: their average value
of particle's coordinate and potential energy, system's total momentum,
single-particle density and the pair distribution function. But the reduced
single-particle matrices and their momentum distributions between them are
different.
