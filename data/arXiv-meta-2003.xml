states have, and what kinds of laws entanglement and also transformation
between entanglement states subject to. Therefore, it is essentialy important
to use proper measures of entanglement which have nice properties. One of the
major candidates of such measures is &quot;entanglement of formation&quot;, and whether
this measurement is additive or not is an important open problem. We aim at
certain states so-called &quot;antisymmetric states&quot; for which the additivity are

strategies, which can help improve outcomes for the participants. With many
players, such quantum games can involve entanglement among many states which is
difficult to implement, especially if the states must be communicated over some

significant $n$-player public goods game that requires only two-particle
entanglement and is thus much easier to implement than more general quantum
mechanisms. In spite of the large temptation to free ride on the efforts of
others in this game, two-particle entanglement is sufficient to give near
optimal expected payoff when players use a simple mixed strategy for which no
player can benefit by making different choices. This mechanism can also address
some heterogeneous preferences among the players.

explained by invoking the ``collapse of the wave function.'' This is a rather
mysterious idea; it would be better to explain the Stern-Gerlach results
without using it. We re-analyze the Stern-Gerlach experiment using path
integrals. We find if we model explicitly the finite width of the beam,
coherent interference within the beam itself provides the space quantization --
without need to invoke the collapse. If we insist on employing only wave
functions with the space and spin parts kept forcibly disentangled, we recreate
the need to invoke the collapse. The collapse-free approach makes more specific
predictions about the shape and position of the scattered beams; if the
interaction region has finite length, these may be testable. Pending
experimental disambiguation, the chief arguments in favor of the collapse-free
approach are that it is simpler and less mysterious, has no adjustable
parameters, and requires the invocation of no new forces.

coinciding with a recently proposed multibeam generalization of the inequality

complementarity, according to which an increase of visibility is at the cost of
a loss in path information, and viceversa.

symmetries: these are symmetries based upon groups with a discrete set of
elements (generally a set of elements that can be enumerated by the positive
integers). In physics we find that discrete symmetries frequently arise as
`internal', non-spacetime symmetries. Permutation symmetry is such a discrete
symmetry arising as the mathematical basis underlying the statistical behaviour
of ensembles of certain types of indistinguishable quantum particle (e.g.,
fermions and bosons). Roughly speaking, if such an ensemble is invariant under
a permutation of its constituent particles (i.e., permutation symmetric) then
one doesn't `count' those permutations which merely `exchange'
indistinguishable particles; rather, the exchanged state is identified with the
original state. This principle of invariance is generally called the
`indistinguishability postulate' [IP], but we prefer to use the term
`permutation invariance' [PI]. It is this symmetry principle that is typically
taken to underpin and explain the nature of (fermionic and bosonic) quantum
statistics (although, as we shall see, this characterisation is not
uncontentious), and it is this principle that has important consequences
regarding the metaphysics of identity and individuality for particles
exhibiting such statistical behaviour.

physically relevant branches of solutions everywhere in the classically

the top of the barrier. The method is checked against exact solutions of the

task. This paper considers a different approach to the problem, by studying the
problem of 'quantum state generation'. This approach provides intriguing links
between many different areas: quantum computation, adiabatic evolution,
analysis of spectral gaps and groundstates of Hamiltonians, rapidly mixing
Markov chains, the complexity class statistical zero knowledge, quantum random
walks, and more.
  We first show that many natural candidates for quantum algorithms can be cast
as a state generation problem. We define a paradigm for state generation,
called 'adiabatic state generation' and develop tools for adiabatic state
generation which include methods for implementing very general Hamiltonians and
ways to guarantee non negligible spectral gaps. We use our tools to prove that
adiabatic state generation is equivalent to state generation in the standard
quantum computing model, and finally we show how to apply our techniques to
generate interesting superpositions related to Markov chains.

  anomalous skin effect</title><description>  Temperature correction to the Casimir force is considered for real metals at
low temperatures. With the temperature decrease the mean free path for
electrons becomes larger than the field penetration depth. In this condition
description of metals with the impedance of anomalous skin effect is shown to
be more appropriate than with the permittivity. The effect is crucial for the
temperature correction. It is demonstrated that in the zero frequency limit the
reflection coefficients should coincide with those of ideal metal if we demand
the entropy to be zero at T=0. All the other prescriptions discussed in the
literature for the $n=0$ term in the Lifshitz formula give negative entropy. It
is shown that the temperature correction in the region of anomalous skin effect
is not suppressed as it happens in the plasma model. This correction will be
important in the future cryogenic measurements of the Casimir force.

questioned on the ground of intrinsic phase indeterminacy of the laser field

CVQT with a laser is valid only if the unknown phase of the laser field is

EPR channel and a classical channel, directly linking between a sender and a

decoherence depends not only on the specific system being studied but also on
whether one is considering coordinate, momentum or phase space. We show that
this is best illustrated by considering Wigner phase space where the measure is
again different. Analytic results for the time development of the Wigner

the form of an expression for the Wigner function at time t in terms of the
initial Wigner function. The result is applied to the motion of a Gaussian wave
packet and to that of a pair of such wave packets. A serious divergence arising
from the assumption of an initially uncoupled state is found to be due to the
zero-point oscillations of the bath and not removed in a cutoff model. As a
consequence, worthwhile results for the equation can only be obtained in the
high temperature limit, where zero-point oscillations are neglected. In that
limit closed form expressions for wave packet spreading and attenuation of
coherence are obtained. These results agree within a numerical factor with
those appearing in the literature, which apply for the case of a particle at
zero temperature that is suddenly coupled to a bath at high temperature. On the
other hand very different results are obtained for the physically consistent
case in which the initial particle temperature is arranged to coincide with
that of the bath.

discussed from a practical point of view, when the nonideal efficiency of the
magnetic mirrors, used for filtering the spin state, is taken into account. In
the idealized case the number N of (ideal) mirrors can be indefinitely
increased, yielding an increasingly better QZE. By contrast, in a practical
situation with imperfect mirrors, there is an optimal number of mirrors, N_opt,
at which the QZE becomes maximum: more frequent measurements would deteriorate
the performance. However, a quantitative analysis shows that a good
experimental test of the QZE is still feasible. These conclusions are of
general validity: in a realistic experiment, the presence of losses and
imperfections leads to an optimal frequency N_opt, which is in general finite.
One should not increase N beyond N_opt. A convenient formula for N_opt, valid
in a broad framework, is derived as a function of the parameters characterizing
the experimental setup.

symmetric d-1 parameter family of mixed bipartite quantum states acting on
Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimension d x d. We prove that in this family the
entanglement cost is generically strictly larger than the distillable
entanglement, such that the set of states for which the distillation process is
asymptotically reversible is of measure zero. This remains true even if the
distillation process is catalytically assisted by pure state entanglement and
every operation is allowed, which preserves the positivity of the partial
transpose. It is shown, that reversibility occurs only in cases where the state
is quasi-pure in the sense that all its pure state entanglement can be revealed
by a simple operation on a single copy. The reversible cases are shown to be
completely characterized by minimal uncertainty vectors for entropic
uncertainty relations.

to isolate three independent, competing selective pressures that we term
compression, transmission, and neutrality selection. The first two affect
genome length: the pressure to conserve resources by compressing the code, and
the pressure to acquire additional information that improves the channel,
increasing the rate of information transmission into each offspring. Noisy
transmission channels (replication with mutations) gives rise to a third
pressure that acts on the actual encoding of information; it maximizes the
fraction of mutations that are neutral with respect to the phenotype. This
neutrality selection has important implications for the evolution of
evolvability. We demonstrate each selective pressure in experiments with

triggered by a property carried by the wave-packet that impinges on that
detector. Different authors call this property particle, but according to the
terminology of this hypothesis, the term full wave is used in this text. The
present article discusses the validity of the empty/full waves hypothesis. It
is shown that the energy conservation principle imposes for a full wave a
continuous trajectory from the source to the detector. That gives legitimacy to
the question -- in case the wave function consists in a couple of
space-separated branches -- which wave-packet was a full wave before the click
in the detector, or, in other authors' terminology, where was the particle
before the detector clicked. This question is a counterfactual question. In
some multi-particle experiments, e.g. Hardy's thought-experiment with an
electron and a positron, the combination of the empty/full waves hypothesis and
counterfactual reasoning leads to a contradiction with the predictions of the
quantum theory. However, it is shown here that this contradiction is solvable
if the locality requirement is relaxed. To the difference from the local hidden
variables, it is not possible to prove or disprove the idea of empty/ full
waves, at least at present. But it is possible to ask whether this hypothesis
offers a solution to the quantum puzzles. The answer is negative. For instance
it offers no solution to the before-before loop. The question remains open
whether the empty/full waves hypothesis is correct, or &quot;God plays dice&quot;.

the physical processes and have been very powerful in describing quantum
computation and information processing tasks. We introduce the notion of
relative phase change for a quantum system undergoing quantum operation. We
find that the relative phase shift of a system not only depends on the state of
the system, but also depends on the initial state of the ancilla with which it
might have interacted in the past. The relative phase change during a sequence
of quantum operations is shown to be non-additive in nature. This property can
attribute a `memory' to a quantum channel. Also the notion of relative phase
shift helps us to define what we call `in-phase quantum channels'. We will
present the relative phase shift for a qubit undergoing depolarizing channel
and complete randomization and discuss their implications.

usual family of random variables in order to encompass nondeterministic ones:
this leads to a frame in which two kinds of correlations emerge: the classical
correlation which is coded in the mixed state of the physical system and a new
correlation, to be called probabilistic entanglement, which may occur also at
pure states. We examine to what extent this characterization of correlations
can be applied to quantum mechanics. Explicit calculations on simple examples
outline that a same quantum state can show only classical correlations or only
entanglement depending on its statistical content; situations may also arise in
which the two kinds of correlations compensate each other.

derived for the reduced density matrix of a dilute gas of massive particles
undergoing scattering interactions with an environment of light particles. The
dynamical variable that naturally decoheres (the pointer basis) is essentially
the local number density of the dilute gas. Earlier master equations for this
sort of system (such as that derived by Joos and Zeh) are recovered on
restricting to the one-particle sector for the distinguished system. The
derivation shows explicitly that the scattering environment stores information
about the system by ``measuring'' the number density. This therefore provides
an important example of the general connection between decoherence and records
indicated by the decoherent histories approach to quantum theory. It also
brings the master equation for this system into a form emphasizing the role of
local densities, which is relevant to current work on deriving hydrodynamic
equations from quantum theory.

5807 (2001) (quant-ph/0106148)), though we deal with pure states. We apply our
method to show that an arbitrary complete multipartite orthogonal basis is
indistinguishable by LOCC, if it contains at least one entangled state. We also
show that probabilistic local distinguishing is possible for full basis if and
only if all vectors are product. We employ our method to prove local
indistinguishability in an example with sets of pure states of 3X3, which shows
that one can have ``more nonlocality with less entanglement'', where ``more
nonlocality'' is in the sense of ``increased local indistinguishability of
orthogonal states''. This example also provides, to our knowledge, the only
known example where d orthogonal states in dXd are locally indistinguishable.

transmitted and reflected particles in the corresponding subsets of identical
experiments, we introduce the notions of scattering channels for transmission
and reflection. We find for both channels the (unitary) scattering matrices and
reconstruct, by known out asymptotes (i.e., by the transmitted and reflected
wave packets), the corresponding in asymptotes. Unlike the out asymptotes for
transmission and reflection, their in asymptotes represent nonorthogonal
functions. As is shown, the position distributions of to-be-transmitted and
to-be-reflected particles, except their average positions, are unpredictable.
At the same time, the momentum distributions of these particles are physically
meaningful and can be observed to the full. We show that both the subensembles
of particles must start (on the average) from the same spatial point, and the
momentum distributions of to-be-scattered and scattered particles must be the
same for each scattering channel. Taking into account these properties, we
define the (individual) delay times for transmission and reflection for wave
packets of an arbitrary width. Besides, to estimate the duration of the
scattering event, we derive the expression for a (total) scattering time.

  Our result provides a general bound on the information-disturbance trade-off

continuous unitary one-parameter groups with bounded spectrum. In contrast,
information gain without disturbance is possible for some completely positive

entangled Bell-like initial states formed from a model two-state atom and sets
of adjacent photon number states of a single mode radiation field is presented.
The entanglement of the initial states and the subsequent time evolution is
assured by finding a positive lower bound on the concurrence of local 2x2
projections of the full 2xinfinity JCM density matrix. It is found that the
time evolution of the lower bound of the concurrence systematically captures
the corresponding collapse and revival features in atomic inversion, relative
entropies of atomic and radiation, mutual entropy, and quantum deficit. The
atom and radiation subsystems exhibit alternating sets of collapses and
revivals in a complementary fashion due to the initially mixed states of the
atom and radiation employed here. This is in contrast with the result obtained
when the initial state of the dissipationless system is a factored pure state
of atom and radiation, where the atomic and radiation entropies are necessarily
the same. The magnitudes of the entanglement lower bound and the atomic and
radiation revivals become larger as both magnitude and phase of the Bell-like
initial state contribution increases. The time evolution of the entropy
difference of the total system and that of the radiation subsystem exhibits
negative regions called &quot;supercorrelated&quot; states which do not appear in the
atomic subsystem. Entangled initial states are found to enhance this
supercorrelated feature. Finally, the effect of phase damping is to randomize
both the subsystems for asymptotically long times .

  Reactions. An Application of an Atom Laser</title><description>  A spectroscopic application of the atom laser is suggested. The spectroscopy
termed 2PACC employs the coherent properties of matter-waves from a two pulse
atom laser. These waves are employed to control a gas-surface chemical
recombination reaction. The method is demonstrated for an Eley-Rideal reaction
of a hydrogen or alkali atom-laser pulse where the surface target is an
adsorbed hydrogen atom. The reaction yields either a hydrogen or alkali hydride
molecule. The desorbed gas phase molecular yield and its internal state is
shown to be controlled by the time and phase delay between two atom-laser
pulses. The calculation is based on solving the time-dependent Schrodinger
equation in a diabatic framework. The probability of desorption which is the
predicted 2PACC signal has been calculated as a function of the pulse
parameters.

separated into a slow part and a fast part. The motion for the slow part is
computed perturbatively in powers of $\omega^{-1}$ to order $\omega^{-4}$ and
the corresponding time independent Hamiltonian is calculated. Such an effective

It is demonstrated that this effective Hamiltonian gives the exact

Resources do not share secret keys with each other, so that the key

shown, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and also a Poisson resummation

has been traditionally called the ``collapse region'', independent of the
initial state of the atoms, provided that the initial pure state of the
radiation field has a photon number probability distribution which is
sufficiently peaked and phase differences that do not vary significantly around
this peak. An approximative analytic expression for the quantity
$\Tr[\rho^2_{A}(t)]$, where $\rho_{A}(t)$ is the reduced density matrix for the

These electrons can be electrostatically held and manipulated much like
electrons in semiconductor heterostructures, but being in a vacuum the spins on

  quantum dot</title><description>  We study theoretically the effects of qubit inhomogeneity on the quantum
logic gate of qubit swap, which is an integral part of the operations of a
quantum computer. Our focus here is to construct a robust pulse sequence for
swap operation in the simultaneous presence of Zeeman inhomogeneity for quantum
dot trapped electron spins and the finite-time ramp-up of exchange coupling in
a double dot. We first present a geometric explanation of spin swap operation,
mapping the two-qubit operation onto a single-qubit rotation. We then show that
in this geometric picture a square-pulse-sequence can be easily designed to
perform swap in the presence of Zeeman inhomogeneity. Finally, we investigate
how finite ramp-up times for the exchange coupling $J$ negatively affect the
performance of the swap gate sequence, and show how to correct the problems
numerically.

polarization on a two-level damped atom. The results demonstrate interesting ac
Stark split of energy levels of damped atom. The split levels have different
energies and lifetimes, both of which depend on the interaction and the damping
rate of atom. When the frequency of the EM wave is tuned to satisfy the
resonance condition in the strong coupling limit, the transition probability
exhibits Rabi oscillation. Momentum transfer between atom and EM wave shows
similar properties as the transition probability under resonance condition. For
a damped atom interacting with EM field, there exists no longer stable state.
More importantly, if the angular frequency of the EM wave is tuned the same as
the atomic transition frequency and its amplitude is adjusted appropriately
according to the damping coefficients, we can prepare a particular 'Dressed
State' of the coupled system between atom and EM field and can keep the system
coherently in this 'Dressed state' for a very long time. This opens another way
to prepare coherent atomic states.

scattering and spin-orbit coupling, encodes an information about {\em
entanglement} of its spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The quantum state--an

elucidated by evaluating quantum information theory measures of entanglement in
the scattering states which determine {\em quantum transport} properties of
spin-polarized electrons injected into a two-dimensional disordered Rashba
spin-split conductor that is attached to the ferromagnetic source and drain
electrodes. Thus, the Landauer transmission matrix, traditionally evaluated to
obtain the spin-resolved conductances, also yields the reduced spin density
operator allowing us to extract quantum-mechanical measures of the detected
electron spin-polarization and spin-coherence, thereby pointing out how to
avoid detrimental {\em decoherence} effects on spin-encoded information

  Coherent Back-action</title><description>  The Casimir-Polder force is an attractive force between a polarizable atom
and a conducting or dielectric boundary. Its original computation was in terms
of the Lamb shift of the atomic ground state in an electromagnetic field (EMF)
modified by boundary conditions along the wall and assuming a stationary atom.
We calculate the corrections to this force due to a moving atom, demanding
maximal preservation of entanglement generated by the moving atom-conducting
wall system. We do this by using non-perturbative path integral techniques
which allow for coherent back-action and thus can treat non-Markovian
processes. We recompute the atom-wall force for a conducting boundary by
allowing the bare atom-EMF ground state to evolve (or self-dress) into the
interacting ground state. We find a clear distinction between the cases of
stationary and adiabatic motions. Our result for the retardation correction for
adiabatic motion is up to twice as much as that computed for stationary atoms.
We give physical interpretations of both the stationary and adiabatic atom-wall
forces in terms of alteration of the virtual photon cloud surrounding the atom
by the wall and the Doppler effect.

spacetime-dependent, while the field operators are constant relative to the

both Poisson (jump) and white-noise (diffusion) measurement processes. In

ensemble of atoms in an optical cavity is considered. Four fields drive a
double-lambda level scheme in the atoms, consisting of a pair of lambda systems
sharing the same set of lower levels. Two of the fields produce maximum
coherence, rho12 = -1/2, between the ground state sublevels 1 and 2. This
pumping scheme involves equal intensity fields that are resonant with both the
one and two-photon transitions of the lambda system. There is no steady-state
absorption of these fields, implying that the fields induce a type
electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) in the medium. An additional
pair of fields interacting with the second lambda system, combined with the EIT
fields, leads to squeezing of the atom spin associated with the ground state
sublevels. Our method involves a new mechanism for creating steady-state spin
squeezing using an optical cavity. As the cooperativity parameter C is
increased, the optimal squeezing varies as C^{-1/3}. For experimentally
accessible values of C, squeezing as large as 90% can be achieved.

  We present an algorithm that is optimal up to a multiplicative constant, as
well as Theta(log n) times faster than previous methods. While our results are
primarily asymptotic, simulation results show that even for relatively small n
our algorithm is faster and yields more efficient circuits than the standard
method. Generically our algorithm can be interpreted as a matrix decomposition
algorithm, yielding an asymptotically efficient decomposition of a binary
matrix into a product of elementary matrices.

symmetric and ordered expansions of non-commuting operators of a bosonic
theory. As a direct application of such quantization rules, we quantize a
classically time evolved function
 $\mathcal{O}(q,p,t)$, and calculate its expectation value in coherent states.
The result can be expressed in terms of the application of a classical operator
which performs a {\em Gaussian smoothing} of the original function
$\mathcal{O}$ evaluated at the center of the coherent state. This scheme
produces a natural semi-classical expansion for the quantum expectation values
at a short time scale. Moreover, since the classical Liouville evolution of a
Gaussian probability density gives the {\bf same} form for the classical
statistical mean value, we can calculate the first order correction in $\hbar$
entirely from the associated classical time evolved function. This allows us to
write a general expression for the Ehrenfest time in terms of the departure of
the centroid of the quantum distribution from the classical trajectory provided
we start with an initially coherent state for each subsystem. In order to
illustrate this approach, we have calculated analytically the Ehrenfest time of
a model with $N$ coupled non-linear oscillators with non-linearity of even
order.

features of coherent control of four-wave mixing as well as of the accompanying
processes in the continuous-wave regime, which involve transitions between
bound and free quantum states. Such opportunities become feasible through
constructive and destructive interference of quantum pathways. Two coupling
schemes of practical importance are investigated. In the first, a ladder energy
level scheme, fully-resonant sum-frequency nonlinear-optical generation of
short-wavelength radiation driven by several strong fields is investigated. The
relaxation processes as well as absorption of the fundamental and generated
radiations, which play an important role, are taken into consideration. It is
shown that the generation output can be considerably increased through the
appropriate adjustment of several laser-induced continuum structures. In the
second, a folded scheme, a possible control of two-photon dissociation
(Lambda-scheme) using auxiliary laser radiation applied to the adjacent
bound-free transition (V-configuration) is investigated. Besides dissociation,
the proposed method enables one to control population transfer between two
upper discreet levels via the lower-energy dissociation continuum, while direct
transition between these states is not allowed. The opportunities of
manipulating these processes as well as of four-wave-mixing-based spectroscopy
are explored both analytically and through a numerical simulation for Na_2

chemical reactions are considered to consist of two processes. One is the
wavepacket propagation on an adiabatic potential energy surface (PES), and the
other is the electronic transition between PES's. Because the latter process is
mathematically equivalent to nonadiabatic transitions between Floquet (dressed)
states, we can control such a process using the semiclassical Zhu-Nakamura
theory for nonadiabatic transitions. For the former process, we incorporate
semiclassical propagation methods such as the Herman-Kluk propagator into
optimization procedures like optimal control theory. We show some numerical
examples for our strategies. We also develop a semiclassical direct algorithm
to treat the adiabatic propagation and nonadiabatic transitions as a whole.

each individual transmitted photon is made to interact with the probe so that
the signal and the probe are left in an entangled state, and projective
measurement by the probe, made subsequent to projective measurement by the
legitimate receiver, yields information about the signal state. The probe
optimization is based on maximizing the Renyi information gain by the probe on
corrected data for a given error rate induced by the probe in the legitimate
receiver. An arbitrary angle is included between the nonorthogonal linear
polarization states of the signal photons. Two sets of optimum probe parameters
are determined which both correspond to the same optimization. Also, a larger
set of optimum probe parameters is found than was known previously for the
standard BB84 protocol. A detailed comparison is made between the complete and
incomplete optimizations, and the latter simpler optimization is also made
complete. Also, the process of key distillation from the quantum transmission
in quantum key distribution is reviewed, with the objective of calculating the
secrecy capacity of the four-state protocol in the presence of the
eavesdropping probe. Emphasis is placed on information leakage to the probe.

QED exhibits no such reduction. Therefore it is possible to test this effect
experimentally.

including Kerr nonlinearity for the field and intensity-dependent atom-field
coupling is discussed. The Hamiltonian for the atom-field system is written in
terms of the elements of a closed algebra, which has
 SU(1,1) and Heisenberg-Weyl algebras as limiting cases. Eigenstates and
eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian are constructed.
 With the field being in a coherent state initially, the dynamical behaviour of
atomic-inversion, field-statistics and uncertainties in the field quadratures
are studied. The appearance of nonclassical features during the evolution of
the field is shown. Further, we explore the overlap of initial and time-evolved
field states.

although formed from a pair of zero-momentum condensate atoms, a condensate
molecule need not dissociate back to the BEC, but may just as well form a
noncondensate atom pair with equal and opposite momentum, i.e., due to rogue
photodissociation. The uncorrelated frequency shift of the photoassociation
spectrum is to the red and linearly dependent on the laser intensity. In
contrast, anomalous correlations due to rogue dissociation lead to a
blueshifted photoassociation spectrum. For sufficiently low light intensities,
the rogue blueshift is dominant and proportional to the squareroot of

its environment is considered. Specifically, for the ground state of the
spin-boson model, the entropy of entanglement of the spin is calculated as a
function of $\alpha$, the strength of the ohmic coupling to the environment,

renormalization group treatment of the related anisotropic Kondo model. For
$\epsilon=0$, the entanglement increases monotonically with $\alpha$, until it
becomes maximal for $\alpha \lim 1^-$. For fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$, the entanglement
is a maximum as a function of $\alpha$ for a value, $\alpha = \alpha_M &lt; 1$.

of a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling and obeying the Robin
boundary condition on a spherical shell in the $D+1$-dimensional global
monopole background. The expressions are derived for the Wightman function, the
vacuum expectation values of the field square, the vacuum energy density,
radial and azimuthal stress components in both regions inside and outside the

generalized Abel-Plana formula for the series over zeros of cylinder functions.
This formula allows us to extract from the vacuum expectation values the parts

asymptotic behavior of the vacuum densities is investigated near the sphere

The second one is strongly non-Markovian and occurs solely during operations on

coherently control quantum mechanical phenomena. In this letter, we establish
physical limits on how closely can a quantum mechanical system be steered to a
desired target state in the presence of relaxation. In particular, we
explicitly compute the maximum coherence or polarization that can be
transferred between coupled nuclear spins in the presence of very general
decoherence mechanisms that include cross-correlated relaxation. We give
analytical expressions for the control laws (pulse sequences) which achieve
these physical limits and provide supporting experimental evidence.
Exploitation of cross-correlation effects has recently led to the development
of powerful methods in NMR spectroscopy to study very large biomolecules in
solution. We demonstrate with experiments that the optimal pulse sequences
provide significant gains over these state of the art methods, opening new
avenues for spectroscopy of much larger proteins. Surprisingly, in spite of
very large relaxation rates, optimal control can transfer coherence without any
loss when cross-correlated relaxation rates are tuned to auto-correlated
relaxation rates.

show that the violation of locality for such an entangled coherent state is
robust against low detection efficiency. Finally, we investigate the
possibility of a bi-chromatic photon blockade realized via the interaction of a

externally driven. We show the effectiveness of the blockade effect even when
more than a single atom is inside the cavity. The possibility to control two
different cavity modes allows some insights into the generation of an entangled

minimally coupled inflaton system is studied with suitable initial conditions
leading to inflation and the system is approximately solved in the limit for
large scale factor. Subsequently normal matter (either non homogeneous inflaton
modes or lighter matter) is introduced as a perturbation and it is seen that
its presence requires the coarse averaging of a gravitational wave function
(which oscillates at trans-Planckian frequencies) having suitable initial
conditions. Such a wave function, which is common for all types of normal
matter, is associated with a ``time density'' in the sense that its modulus is
related to the amount of time spent in a given interval (or the rate of flow of
time). One is then finally led to an effective evolution equation (Schroedinger
Schwinger-Tomonaga) for ``normal'' matter. An analogy with the emergence of a
temperature in statistical mechanics is also pointed out.

for the electron which differs by an additional spin-dependent term from that
originally proposed by de Broglie and Bohm. In this paper we explore some of
the implications of the modified guidance law. We bring out a property of
mutual dependence in the particle coordinates that arises in product states,
and show that the quantum potential has scalar and vector components which
implies the particle is subject to a Lorentz-like force. The conditions for the
classical limit and the limit of negligible spin are given, and the empirical
sufficiency of the model is demonstrated. We then present a series of
calculations of the trajectories based on two-dimensional Gaussian wave packets
which illustrate how the additional spin-dependent term plays a significant
role in structuring both the individual trajectories and the ensemble. The
single packet corresponds to quantum inertial motion. The distinct features
encountered when the wavefunction is a product or a superposition are explored,
and the trajectories that model the two-slit experiment are given. The latter
paths exhibit several new characteristics compared with the original de

degree of reality in terms of quantum measurement theory. In fact, they arise
naturally from considering continuous observation of a damped quantum system. A
particularly useful form of quantum trajectories is as linear (but non-unitary)
stochastic Schrodinger equations. In the limit where a strong local oscillator
is used in the detection, and where the system is not driven, these quantum
trajectories can be solved. This gives an alternate derivation of the
probability distributions for completed homodyne and heterodyne detection
schemes. It also allows the previously intractable problem of real-time
adaptive measurements to be treated. The results for an analytically soluble
example of adaptive phase measurements are presented, and future developments
discussed.

15-dimensional sphere $S^{15}$, which allows for a natural (last) Hopf
fibration with $S^8$ as base and $S^7$ as fiber. A striking feature is, as in
the case of 1 and 2 qubits, that the map is entanglement sensitive, and the two
distinct ways of un-entangling 3 qubits are naturally related to the Hopf map.
We define a quantity that measures the degree of entanglement of the 3-qubit

entanglement constitutes a fundamental recent advance in the field of quantum
information. Such bipartite bound-entangled (BE) quantum states \emph{could}
fall into two distinct categories: (1) Inseparable states with positive partial
transposition (PPT), and (2) States with negative partial transposition (NPT).
While the existence of PPT BE states has been confirmed, \emph{only one} class
of \emph{conjectured} NPT BE states has been discovered so far. We provide
explicit constructions of a variety of multi-copy undistillable NPT states, and
conjecture that they constitute families of NPT BE states. For example, we show
that for every pure state of Schmidt rank greater than or equal to three, one
can construct n-copy undistillable NPT states, for any $n\geq1$. The abundance
of such conjectured NPT BE states, we believe, considerably strengthens the
notion that being NPT is only a necessary condition for a state to be
distillable.

phenomenological representation of Lindblad decoherence mechanisms. We use this
formalism to describe the interaction of a single stationary multilevel atom
with one or more propagating classical or quantum laser fields, and we describe
in detail several manifestations and applications of electromagnetically
induced transparency. In addition to providing a clear description of the
nonlinear optical characteristics of electromagnetically transparent systems
that lead to ``ultraslow light,'' we verify that -- in principle -- a
multi-particle atomic or molecular system could be used as either a low power
optical switch or a quantum phase shifter. However, we demonstrate that the
presence of significant dephasing effects destroys the induced transparency,
and that increasing the number of particles weakly interacting with the probe
field only reduces the nonlinearity further. Finally, a detailed calculation of
the relative quantum phase induced by a system of atoms on a superposition of
spatially distinct Fock states predicts that a significant quasi-Kerr
nonlinearity and a low entropy cannot be simultaneously achieved in the
presence of arbitrary spontaneous emission rates. Within our model, we identify
the constraints that need to be met for this system to act as a one-qubit and a
two-qubit conditional phase gate.

time and query complexity $O(\exp(C\sqrt{\log N}))$. In this problem an oracle
computes a function $f$ on the dihedral group $D_N$ which is invariant under a
hidden reflection in $D_N$. By contrast the classical query complexity of DHSP
is $O(\sqrt{N})$. The algorithm also applies to the hidden shift problem for an
arbitrary finitely generated abelian group.
  The algorithm begins with the quantum character transform on the group, just
as for other hidden subgroup problems. Then it tensors irreducible
representations of $D_N$ and extracts summands to obtain target
representations. Finally, state tomography on the target representations
reveals the hidden subgroup.

framed in the form of a bet, R. D. Gill formulated criteria to assure that all
non-locality is precluded from simulation-algorithms used to test Bell's
theorem. This is achieved in part by parceling out the subroutines for the
source and both detectors to three separate computers. He argues that, in light
of Bell's theorem, following these criteria absolutely precludes mimicking
EPR-B correlations as computed with Quantum Mechanics and observed in
experiments. Herein, nevertheless, we describe just such an local algorithm,
fully faithful to his criteria, that yields results mimicking exactly quantum
correlations. We observe that our simulation-algorithm succeeds by altering an
implicit assumption made by Bell to the equivalent effect that the source of
EPR pairs is a single Poisson process followed by deterministic detection.
Instead we assume the converse, namely that the source is deterministic but
detection involves multiple, independent Poisson processes, one at each
detector with an intensity given by Malus' Law. Finally, we speculate on some
consequences this might have for quantum computing algorithms.

heat kernel expansions, even those including the integrated boundary terms. On
the other hand, it is known that the divergent terms in the regularized (but
not yet renormalized) total vacuum energy are associated with the heat kernel
coefficients. Here a recent study of the relations among the eigenvalue
density, the heat kernel, and the integral kernel of the operator
$e^{-t\sqrt{H}}$ is exploited to characterize this association completely.
Various previously isolated observations about the structure of the regularized
energy emerge naturally. For over 20 years controversies have persisted
stemming from the fact that certain (presumably physically meaningful) terms in
the renormalized vacuum energy density in the interior of a cavity become
singular at the boundary and correlate to certain divergent terms in the
regularized total energy. The point of view of the present paper promises to
help resolve these issues.

mechanics due to Berry and Robbins [Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A (1997) 453,
1771-1790] is generalised within a group-theoretical framework. The
construction of Berry and Robbins is re-formulated in terms of certain locally
flat vector bundles over n-particle configuration space. It is shown how
families of such bundles can be constructed from irreducible representations of
the group SU(2n). The construction of Berry and Robbins, which leads to a
definite connection between spin and statistics (the physically correct
connection), is shown to correspond to the completely symmetric
representations. The spin-statistics connection is typically broken for general
SU(2n) representations, which may admit, for a given value of spin, both bose
and fermi statistics, as well as parastatistics. The determination of the
allowed values of the spin and statistics reduces to the decomposition of
certain zero-weight representations of a (generalised) Weyl group of SU(2n). A
formula for this decomposition is obtained using the Littlewood-Richardson
theorem for the decomposition of representations of U(m+n) into representations
of U(m)*U(n).

creation by spontaneous emission in a system of two non-overlapping two-level
atoms. We calculate and illustrate graphically populations of the collective
atomic states and the Wootters entanglement measure (concurrence) for two sets
of initial atomic conditions. Our calculations include the dipole-dipole
interaction and a spatial separation between the atoms that the antisymmetric
state of the system is included throughout even for small interatomic
separations. It is shown that spontaneous emission can lead to a transient
entanglement between the atoms even if the atoms were prepared initially in an
unentangled state. We find that the ability of spontaneous emission to create
the transient entanglement relies on the absence of population in the
collective symmetric state of the system. For the initial state of only one
atom excited, the entanglement builds up rapidly in time and reaches a maximum
for the parameter values corresponding roughly to zero population in the
symmetric state. On the other hand, for the initial condition of both atoms
excited, the atoms remain unentangled until the symmetric state is depopulated.
A simple physical interpretation of these results is given in terms of the
diagonal states of the density matrix of the system. We also study entanglement
creation in a system of two non-identical atoms of different transition
frequencies. It is found that the entanglement between the atoms can be
enhanced compared to that for identical atoms, and can decay with two different
time scales resulting from the coherent transfer of the population from the
symmetric to the antisymmetric state. In addition, we find that a decaying
initial entanglement between the atoms can display a revival behaviour.

induces a splitting of the cavity resonances with a high frequency component,
that is tuned to the anti-Stokes Raman sideband of the particles oscillating in

Tight confinement in the optical lattice together with the prediction, that

be constructed from A so given d it suffices to compute A. It is known that A
can be exponentially large in d so just to write down A we need exponential
time in the input size log d. Hence we introduce the regulator R=ln A and ask
for the value of R to n decimal places. The best known classical algorithm has
sub-exponential running time O(exp(sqrt(log d)), poly(n)). Hallgren's quantum
algorithm gives the result in polynomial time O(poly(log d),poly(n)) with
probability 1/poly(log d). The idea of the algorithm falls into two parts:
using the formalism of algebraic number theory we convert the problem of
solving Pell's equation into the problem of determining R as the period of a
function on the real numbers. Then we generalise the quantum Fourier transform
period finding algorithm to work in this situation of an irrational period on
the (not finitely generated) abelian group of real numbers.
  These notes are intended to be accessible to a reader having no prior

quantum mechanics to solve the prime factorization problem on a spin ensemble
without any quantum entanglement. The ensemble quantum computation for the
prime factorization is based on the basic principle that both a closed quantum
system and its ensemble obey the same unitary dynamics of quantum mechanics if
there is not any decoherence effect in both the quantum system and its
ensemble. It uses the NMR multiple-quantum measurement techniques to output the
quantum computational results that are the inphase multiple-quantum spectra of
the spin ensemble. It has been shown that the inphase NMR multiple-quantum
spectral intensities used to search for the period of the modular exponential
function may reduce merely in a polynomial form as the qubit number of the spin
ensemble. The time evolution process of the modular exponential operation on
the quantum computer obeys the unitary dynamics of quantum mechanics and hence
the computational output is governed by the quantum dynamics. This essential
difference between the quantum computer and the classical one could be the key
point for the quantum computation outperforming the classical one in the prime
factorization on a spin ensemble without any quantum entanglement. It has been
shown that the prime factorization based on the quantum dynamics on a spin
ensemble is locally efficient at least. This supports the conjecture that the
quantum dynamics could play an important role for the origin of power of
quantum computation and quantum entanglement could not be a unique resource to
achieve power of quantum computation in the prime factorization.

partners so that leaving out any number of them, the rest do not have the
complete information. Strong multiqubit correlations in the state by which
secret sharing is carried out, had been proposed as a criterion for security of
such protocols against individual attacks by an eavesdropper. However we show
that states with weak multiqubit correlations can also be used for secure
secret sharing. That our state has weak multiqubit correlations, is shown from
the perspective of violation of local realism, and also by showing that its
higher order correlations are described by lower ones. We then present a
unified criterion for security of secret sharing in terms of violation of local

Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state (with strong multiqubit correlations), as
well as states of a different class (with weak multiqubit correlations).

known eigenstates and eigenvalues of a number of quasi-exactly solvable
Hamiltonians, but also construct a convergent approximation scheme for locating
those levels, not amenable to analytical treatments. The fact that, the above
method yields an expansion of the wave functions in terms of corresponding
energies, enables one to treat energy as a variational parameter, which can be
effectively used for the identification of the eigenstates. It is particularly
useful for the quasi-exactly solvable systems, where the ground state is known
and a number of eigenstates are bounded, both below and above. The efficacy of
the procedure is illustrated by obtaining, the low-lying excited states of a
prototypical double-well potential, where the conventional techniques are not
very reliable. Our approach yields the approximate eigenfunctions and
eigenvalues, whose accuracy can be improved to any desired level, in a
controlled manner. Comparing the present results with those of an independent
numerical method, it was found that, the first few terms in our approximate
solutions are enough to yield the excited state eigenvalues, accurate upto the
third place of the decimal.

information processing by the universe? We find that an affirmative answer has
important consequences for the measurement problem. In particular, we calculate
the amount of quantum information processing involved in the evolution of
physical systems, assuming a finite degree of fine-graining of Hilbert space.
This assumption is shown to imply that there is a finite capacity to sustain
the immense entanglement that measurement entails. When this capacity is
overwhelmed, the system's unitary evolution becomes computationally unstable
and the system suffers an information transition (`collapse'). Classical
behaviour arises from the rapid cycles of unitary evolution and information
transitions.
  Thus, the fine-graining of Hilbert space determines the location of the
`Heisenberg cut', the mesoscopic threshold separating the microscopic, quantum
system from the macroscopic, classical environment. The model can be viewed as
a probablistic complement to decoherence, that completes the measurement
process by turning decohered improper mixtures of states into proper mixtures.
It is shown to provide a natural resolution to the measurement problem and the
basis problem.

The &quot;coined&quot; walk
uses discrete time steps, and contains, besides the particle making the walk, a
second quantum system, the coin, that determines the direction in which the
particle will move. The continuous walk operates with continuous time. Here a
third model for a quantum walk is proposed, which is based on an analogy to
optical interferometers. It is a discrete-time model, and the unitary operator
that advances the walk one step depends only on the local structure of the
graph on which the walk is taking place. No quantum coin is introduced. This
type of walk allows us to introduce elements, such as phase shifters, that have
no counterpart in classical random walks. Walks on the line and cycle are
discussed in some detail, and a probability current for these walks is
introduced. The relation to the coined quantum walk is also discussed. The
paper concludes by showing how to define these walks for a general graph.

make clear the conceptual and historical context characterizing the new
approach. After having reviewed the mathematical techniques (stochastic
differential calculus) which are essential for the rigorous and precise

and we stress its relevant conceptual achievements. The new proposal requires
also to work out an appropriate interpretation; a procedure which leads us to a

It will be shown that the expectation value of the momentum operator depends in

`locations', when these naturally correspond to a separation of the total
Hilbert space in an orthogonal sum of subspaces, rather than a tensor product
decomposition. It is shown that the set of SL channels decomposes into four
disjoint families of channels. Explicit expressions to generate all channels in

local subspace preserving (LSP) channels, is precisely the intersection between
the set of subspace preserving channels and the SL channels. For a subclass of

operation the internal state has experienced when the particle is returned at
the output. Suppose a particle is put in a superposition between the input of
the first and the second machine. Here it is shown that the total evolution
caused by a pair of such devices is not uniquely determined by the channels of
the two machines. Such `global' channels describing the machine pair are
examples of gluings of the two single machine channels. Under the limiting

two sources to a common receiver. The radiation travels through free space in
the presence of noise. The information resides in a relationship between the
two beams. We inquire into whether itis possible, in principle, that the
locations of the transmitters can be concealed from a party who receives the
radiation and decodes the information. Direction finding entails making a set
of measurements on asignal and constructing an analytic continuation of the
time dependent fields from the results. The fact that this process is generally
different in quantum mechanics and in classical electrodynamics is the basis in
this investigation. We develop a model based upon encoding information into a
microscopic, transverse, non-local quantum image (whose dimensions are of the
order of a few wavelengths) and using a detector of a type recently proposed by
Strekalov et al. The optical system, which uses SPDC (Spontaneous Parametric
Down Conversion), functions like a Heisenberg microscope: the transverse
length, which encodes the signal information, is conjugate to the transverse
momentum of the light. In the model, reading the signal information spoils the
directional resolution of the detector, while determining the directions to the
sources spoils the information content. Each beam, when examined in isolation,
is random and indistinguishable from the background noise. We conclude that
quantum communications can, in principle, be made secure against
direction-finding, even from the party receiving the communication.

with the direction of information loss $\Delta I$ displayed by the random

intrinsic time-arrow becomes uncertain. We propose the heuristic relationship
$1/[1+exp(-s\Delta I)]$ for the probability of the intrinsic time-arrow. The
main parts of the present work are trying to confirm this heuristic equation.
The probability of intrinsic time arrow is defined by Bayesian inference from
the observed random process. From irreversible thermodynamic systems, the
proposed heuristic probabilities follow via the Gallavotti-Cohen relations
between time-reversed random processes. In order to explore the underlying
microscopic mechanism, a trivial microscopic process is analyzed and an obvious
discrepancy is identified. It can be resolved by quantum theory. The
corresponding trivial quantum process will exactly confirm the proposed

a uniform SC expression not only is tractable but it gives remarkably accurate
numerical results for the standard map in both the Fermi-golden-rule and
Lyapunov regimes. Because it allows Monte Carlo evaluation, the uniform

the approximations made by other authors in these regimes, rather than an a

in the classical Kolmogorov probability model. However, this model should be
considered as a calculus of contextual probabilities. In our approach it is
forbidden to consider abstract context independent probabilities: ``first
context and then probability.'' We start with the conventional formula of total
probability for contextual (conditional) probabilities and then we rewrite it
by eliminating combinations of incompatible contexts from consideration. In
this way we obtain interference of probabilities without to appeal to the
Hilbert space formalism or wave mechanics. However, we did not just reconstruct
the probabilistic formalism of conventional quantum mechanics. Our contextual
probabilistic model is essentially more general and, besides the projection to
the complex Hilbert space, it has other projections. The most important new

field, applied parallel to the two-dimensional electron gas in which the
quantum dot is defined, Zeeman splitting of the orbital states is directly
observed by measurements of electron transport through the dot. By applying
short voltage pulses, we can populate the excited spin state with one electron
and monitor relaxation of the spin. We find a lower bound on T1 of 50
microseconds at 7.5 T, only limited by our signal-to-noise ratio. A continuous
measurement of the charge on the dot has no observable effect on the spin
relaxation.

  Bose gas</title><description>  We use the stochastic limit method to study long time quantum dynamics of a
test particle interacting with a dilute Bose gas. The case of arbitrary
form-factors and an arbitrary, not necessarily equilibrium, quasifree low
density state of the Bose gas is considered. Starting from microscopic dynamics
we derive in the low density limit a quantum white noise equation for the
evolution operator. This equation is equivalent to a quantum stochastic
equation driven by a quantum Poisson process with intensity $S-1$, where $S$ is
the one-particle $S$ matrix. The novelty of our approach is that the equations
are derived directly in terms of correlators, without use of a Fock-antiFock
(or Gel'fand-Naimark-Segal) representation. Advantages of our approach are the
simplicity of derivation of the limiting equation and that the algebra of the
master fields and the Ito table do not depend on the initial state of the Bose
gas. The notion of a causal state is introduced. We construct master fields
(white noise and number operators) describing the dynamics in the low density
limit and prove the convergence of chronological (causal) correlators of the
field operators to correlators of the master fields in the causal state.

unless j=k. The definition extends to quantum computations, where j and k vary
over the 2^n binary expressions for integers 0,1 ..., 2^n-1, given n qubits.
Such operators do not affect outcomes of the projective measurement {&lt;j| ; 0 &lt;=
j &lt;= 2^n-1} but rather create arbitrary relative phases among the computational
basis states {|j&gt; ; 0 &lt;= j &lt;= 2^n-1}. These relative phases are often required
in applications.
  Constructing quantum circuits for diagonal computations using standard
techniques requires either O(n^2 2^n) controlled-not gates and one-qubit Bloch
sphere rotations or else O (n 2^n) such gates and a work qubit. This work
provides a recursive, constructive procedure which inputs the matrix
coefficients of U and outputs such a diagram containing 2^{n+1}-3 alternating
controlled-not gates and one-qubit z-axis Bloch sphere rotations. Up to a
factor of two, these circuits are the smallest possible. Moreover, should the
computation U be a tensor of diagonal one-qubit computations of the form
R_z(\alpha)=e^{-i \alpha/2}|0&gt;&lt;0|+ e^{i \alpha/2} |1&gt;&lt;1|, then a cancellation
of controlled-not gates reduces our circuit to that of an n-qubit tensor.

2-D grid of size sqrt(n) by sqrt(n)? The problem is that sqrt(n) time seems to
be needed for each query, just to move amplitude across the grid. Here we show
that this problem can be surmounted, refuting a claim to the contrary by
Benioff. In particular, we show how to search a d-dimensional hypercube in time
O(sqrt n) for d at least 3, or O((sqrt n)(log n)^(3/2)) for d=2. More
generally, we introduce a model of quantum query complexity on graphs,
motivated by fundamental physical limits on information storage, particularly
the holographic principle from black hole thermodynamics. Our results in this
model include almost-tight upper and lower bounds for many search tasks; a
generalized algorithm that works for any graph with good expansion properties,
not just hypercubes; and relationships among several notions of `locality' for
unitary matrices acting on graphs. As an application of our results, we give an

  Model with Intrinsic Friction</title><description>  The fundamentals of a quantum heat engine are derived from first principles.
The study is based on the equation of motion of a minimum set of operators
which is then used to define the state of the system. The relation between the
quantum framework and thermodynamical observables is examined. A four stroke
heat engine model with a coupled two-level-system as a working fluid is used to
explore the fundamental relations. In the model used, the internal Hamiltonian
does not commute with the external control field which defines the two
adiabatic branches. Heat is transferred to the working fluid by coupling to hot
and cold reservoirs under constant field values. Explicit quantum equation of
motion for the relevant observables are derived on all branches. The dynamics
on the heat transfer constant field branches is solved in closed form. On the
adiabats, a general numerical solution is used and compared with a particular
analytic solution. These solutions are combined to construct the cycle of
operation. The engine is then analyzed in terms of frequency-entropy and
entropy-temperature graphs. The irreversible nature of the engine is the result
of finite heat transfer rates and friction-like behavior due to
noncommutability of the internal and external Hamiltonian.

  Extending the `probability via expectation' approach of Whittle to

experiments as mathematical concepts and shows how to model complementarity,
uncertainty, probability, nonlocality and dynamics in these terms. The approach
carries no connotation of unlimited repeatability; hence it can be applied to
unique systems such as the universe.
  Consistent experiments provide an elegant solution to the reality problem,

particular, in the worst-probabilistic setting, we prove that the error of the
QS algorithm using $M - 1$ queries is $3\pi /(4M)$ with probability $8/\pi^2$,
which improves the error bound $\pi M^{-1} + \pi^2 M^{-2}$ of Brassard et al.
We also present bounds with probabilities $p\in (1/2, 8/\pi^2]$ and show they
are sharp for large $M$ and $NM^{-1}$. In the average-probabilistic setting, we
prove that the QS algorithm has error of order $\min\{M^{-1}, N^{-1/2}\}$ if
$M$ is divisible by 4. This bound is optimal, as recently shown in [10]. For M
not divisible by 4, the QS algorithm is far from being optimal if $M \ll
N^{1/2}$ since its error is proportional to $M^{-1}^$.

  protocol</title><description>  We propose a generalization of quantum teleportation: the so-called
many-to-many quantum communication of the information of a d-level system from
N spatially separated senders to M&gt;N receivers situated at different locations.
We extend the concept of asymmetric telecloning from qubits to d-dimensional
systems. We investigate the broadcasting of entanglement by using local 1-&gt;2
optimal universal asymmetric Pauli machines and show that the maximal
fidelities of the two final entangled states are obtained when symmetric
machines are applied. Cloning of entanglement is studied using a nonlocal
optimal universal asymmetric cloning machine and we show that the symmetric
machine optimally copies the entanglement. The &quot;many-to-many&quot; teleportation
scheme is applied in order to distribute entanglement shared between two
observers to two pairs of spatially separated observers.

we need to find the rules that engage observers with quantum mechanical
systems. The author has proposed five rules that are discovered by insisting on
empirical completeness; that is, by requiring the rules to draw empirical
information from Schrodinger's solutions that is more complete than is
currently possible with the (Born) probability interpretation. I discard Born's
interpretation, introducing probability solely through probability current.
These rules tell us something about brains. They require the existence of
observer brain states that are neither conscious nor unconscious. I call them
'ready' brain states because they are on stand-by, ready to become conscious
the moment they are stochastically chosen. Two of the rules are selection rules
involving ready brain states. The place of these rules in a wider theoretical
context is discussed. Key Words: boundary conditions, consciousness,
decoherence, macroscopic superposition, Penrose, state reduction, von Neumann,
wave collapse.

highly structured universe, and these can only come about through quantum
mechanical state reductions - i.e., through measurements. The choice is
between: An 'objective' measurement that allows reduction to occur independent
of conscious observers, and an 'observer' based measurement that ties reduction
to the existence of a conscious observer. It is shown in this paper that that
choice cannot be determined empirically; so how we finally understand state
reduction will be decided by the way that reduction is used in a wider (future)
theoretical framework. Key Words: consciousness, decoherence, stochastic
choice, wave collapse.

where the time that it takes for a particle capture (and reduction of the
original state) is constrained by the Heisenberg uncertainty between time and
energy . The usual interpretation of this equation is found to conflict with
the Hamiltonian dynamics of the interaction. Another interpretation of this
equation seems to solve that problem, but then another difficulty arises. We
conclude that the Penrose theory cannot reflect the timing implicit in the
Hamiltonian dynamics unless it can be amended to take account of the

a desired interaction? Vidal, Hammerer and Cirac [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 (2002)
237902] have obtained a set of powerful results characterizing the time-optimal
simulation of a two-qubit quantum gate using a fixed interaction Hamiltonian
and fast local control over the individual qubits. How practically useful are
these results? We prove that there are two-qubit Hamiltonians such that
time-optimal simulation requires infinitely many steps of evolution, each
infinitesimally small, and thus is physically impractical. A procedure is given
to determine which two-qubit Hamiltonians have this property, and we show that
almost all Hamiltonians do. Finally, we determine some bounds on the penalty
that must be paid in the simulation time if the number of steps is fixed at a
finite number, and show that the cost in simulation time is not too great.

is comparable to the tunneling rate as computed by the instanton method, at

theories to include the amount of space, time, momentum, and energy resources
required to determine properties of systems may influence what is true in
physics and mathematics at a foundational level. Background material, on the
dependence of region or system sizes on both the resources required to study
the regions or systems and the indirectness of the reality status of the
systems, suggests that one associate to each amount, r, of resources a domain,
D_{r}, a theory, T_{r}, and a language, L_{r}. D_{r} is limited in that all
statements in D_{r} require at most r resources to verify or refute. T_{r} is
limited in that any theorem of T_{r} must be provable using at most r
resources. Also any theorem of T_{r} must be true in D_{r}. L_{r} is limited in
that all expressions in L_{r} require at most r resources to create, display,
and maintain. A partial ordering of the resources is used to describe minimal
use of resources, a partial ordering of the T_{r}, and motion of an observer
using resources to acquire knowledge. Reflection principles are used to push
the effect of Godel's incompleteness theorem on consistency up in the partial
ordering. It is suggested that a coherent theory of physics and mathematics, or
theory of everything, is a common extension of all the T_{r}.

in the two-atom Dicke model and identify the source of the discrepancy recently
reported by Banerjee and Zhou et al that one can observe entanglement without
spin squeezing. Our calculations demonstrate that there are two criteria for
entanglement, one associated with the two-photon coherences that create
two-photon entangled states, and the other associated with populations of the
collective states. We find that the spin-squeezing parameter correctly predicts
entanglement in the two-atom Dicke system only if it is associated with
two-photon entangled states, but fails to predict entanglement when it is
associated with the entangled symmetric state. This explicitly identifies the
source of the discrepancy and explains why the system can be entangled without
spin-squeezing. We illustrate these findings in three examples of the
interaction of the system with thermal, classical squeezed vacuum and quantum
squeezed vacuum fields.

  Category</title><description>  A new approach is suggested to the problem of quantising causal sets, or
topologies, or other such models for space-time (or space). The starting point
is the observation that entities of this type can be regarded as objects in a
category whose arrows are structure-preserving maps. This motivates
investigating the general problem of quantising a system whose `configuration
space' (or history-theory analogue) can be regarded as the set of objects in a
category. In this first of a series of papers, we study this question in
general and develop a scheme based on constructing an analogue of the group
that is used in the canonical quantisation of a system whose configuration
space is a manifold $Q\simeq G/H$ where G and H are Lie groups. In particular,
we choose as the analogue of G the monoid of `arrow fields' on the category.
Physically, this means that an arrow between two objects in the category is
viewed as some sort of analogue of momentum. After finding the `category
quantisation monoid', we show how suitable representations can be constructed
using a bundle of Hilbert spaces over the set of objects.

N-dimensional quantum system that requires only an $N^2$-dimensional quantum
environment and random classical fields. This model offers the advantage that
it may be implemented on small quantum information processors in order to
explore the intermediate regime between semiclassical and fully quantum models.
We consider in particular $\sigma_z\sigma_z$ system-environment couplings which
induce coherence (phase) damping, though the model is directly extendable to
other coupling Hamiltonians. Effective, irreversible phase-damping of the
system is obtained by applying an additional stochastic Hamiltonian on the
environment alone, periodically redressing it and thereby irreversibliy
randomizing the system phase information that has leaked into the environment
as a result of the coupling. This model is exactly solvable in the case of
phase-damping, and we use this solution to describe the model's behavior in
some limiting cases. In the limit of small stochastic phase kicks the system's
coherence decays exponentially at a rate which increases linearly with the kick
frequency. In the case of strong kicks we observe an effective decoupling of
the system from the environment. We present a detailed implementation of the
method on an nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor.

argue to the contrary that `true coherence' or `absolute phase' is always
illusory, as the concept of absolute time on a scale beyond direct human
experience is meaningless. All we can ever do is to use an agreed time
standard. In this context, a laser beam is fundamentally as good a `clock' as
any other. I explain in detail why this claim is true, and defend my argument

with Macroscopic Quantum Coherence (MQC) theory, constitutes a complete two-bit
quantum computer. The manipulation of the system is easily implemented with
alternating magnetic fields. A \textit{universal} set of quantum gates is
deemed available by means of all unitary single bit operations and a
controlled-not (\textsc{cnot}) sequence. We use multi-dimensional MQC theory
and time-dependent first order perturbation theory to analyze the model. Our
calculations show that a two qubit arrangement, each having a diameter of
200nm, operating in the flux regime can be operated with a static magnetic
field of $\sim 0.1$T, and an alternating dynamic magnetic field of amplitude
$\sim 1$ Gauss and frequency $\sim 10$Hz. The operational time $\tau_{op}$ is
estimated to be $\sim 10$ns.

Hamiltonian or Hilbert space deviates from the desired one. Two important
examples we address are spin-coupled quantum dots in the presence of spin-orbit
perturbations to the Heisenberg exchange interaction, and off-resonant
transitions of a qubit embedded in a multilevel Hilbert space. We propose a
``dressed qubit'' transformation for dealing with such inherent errors. Unlike
quantum error correction, the dressed qubits method does not require additional
operations or encoding redundancy, is insenstitive to error magnitude, and
imposes no new experimental constraints.

  chains</title><description>  We show that, in a system with defects, two-particle states may experience
destructive quantum interference, or antiresonance. It prevents an excitation
localized on a defect from decaying even where the decay is allowed by energy
conservation. The system studied is a qubit chain or an equivalent spin chain
with an anisotropic ($XXZ$) exchange coupling in a magnetic field. The chain
has a defect with an excess on-site energy. It corresponds to a qubit with the
level spacing different from other qubits. We show that, because of the
interaction between excitations, a single defect may lead to multiple localized
states. The energy spectra and localization lengths are found for
two-excitation states. The localization of excitations facilitates the
operation of a quantum computer. Analytical results for strongly anisotropic
coupling are confirmed by numerical studies.

method for suppressing decoherence in open quantum systems: in both cases
strong coupling to an external system or apparatus induces a dynamical
superselection rule that partitions the open system's Hilbert space into
quantum Zeno subspaces. Our unification makes use of von Neumann's ergodic
theorem and avoids making any of the symmetry assumptions usually made in
discussions of BB. Thus we are able to generalize BB to arbitrary fast and
strong pulse sequences, requiring no symmetry, and to show the existence of two
alternatives to pulsed BB: continuous decoupling, and pulsed measurements. Our
unified treatment enables us to derive limits on the efficacy of the BB method:
we explicitly show that the inverse QZE implies that BB can in some cases
accelerate, rather than inhibit, decoherence.

a single case all the (below cut-off) nonrelativistic solutions, but no such
simplification holds for the relativistic equation, so that qualitatively
different ``shallow'' and ``deep'' tunneling regimes may be identified
relativistically. The nonrelativistic forerunner at a position beyond the
penetration length of the asymptotic stationary wave does not tunnel;
nevertheless, it arrives at the traversal (semiclassical or
B\&quot;uttiker-Landauer) time &quot;tau&quot;. The corresponding relativistic forerunner is
more complex: it oscillates due to the interference between two saddle point
contributions, and may be characterized by two times for the arrival of the
maxima of lower and upper envelops. There is in addition an earlier
relativistic forerunner, right after the causal front, which does tunnel.
Within the penetration length, tunneling is more robust for the precursors of

pulsing the exchange interaction between two single electron quantum dots.
Spin-orbit coupling enters as a small spin precession when electrons tunnel
between dots. For adiabatic pulses the resulting gate is described by a unitary
operator acting on the four-dimensional Hilbert space of two qubits. If the
precession axis is fixed, time-symmetric pulsing constrains the set of possible
gates to those which, when combined with single qubit rotations, can be used in
a simple CNOT construction. Deviations from time-symmetric pulsing spoil this
construction. The effect of time asymmetry is studied by numerically
integrating the Schr\&quot;odinger equation using parameters appropriate for GaAs
quantum dots. Deviations of the implemented gate from the desired form are
shown to be proportional to dimensionless measures of both spin-orbit coupling
and time asymmetry of the pulse.

Bergeron, J. Math. Phys. 42, 3983 (2001)], we
presented a method to obtain a continuous transition from classical to quantum
mechanics starting from the usual phase space formulation of classical
mechanics. This procedure was based on a Koopman-von Neumann approach where
classical equations are reformulated into a quantumlike form. In this article,
we develop a different derivation of quantum equations, based on purely
classical stochastic arguments, taking some elements from the
Bohm-Fenyes-Nelson approach. This study starts from a remark noticed by
different authors [M. Born, Physics in My Generation (Pergamon Press, London,
1956); E. Prugovecki, Stochastic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Spacetime
(Reidel, Dordrecht, 1986)], suggesting that physical continuous observables are
stochastic by nature. Following this idea, we study how intrinsic stochastic
properties can be introduced into the framework of classical mechanics. Then we
analyze how the quantum theory can emerge from this modified classical
framework. This approach allows us to show that the transition from classical
to quantum formalism (for a spinless particle) does not require real
postulates, but rather soft generalizations.

operations by elementary quantum gates. It is now well known that the
collection of 1-bit and 2-bit quantum gates are universal for quantum
computation, i.e., any n-bit unitary operation can be carried out by
concatenations of 1-bit and 2-bit elementary quantum gates.
  Three contemporary quantum devices--cavity QED, ion traps and quantum
dots--have been widely regarded as perhaps the most promising candidates for
the construction of elementary quantum gates. In this paper, we describe the
physical properties of these devices, and show the mathematical derivations
based on the interaction of the laser field as control with atoms, ions or
electron spins, leading to the following: (i) the 1-bit unitary rotation gates;
and (ii) the 2-bit quantum phase gates and the controlled-not gate. This paper
is aimed at providing a sufficiently self-contained survey account of
analytical nature for mathematicians, physicists and computer scientists to aid
interdisciplinary understanding in the research of quantum computation.

  contemporary local quantum physics</title><description>  After recalling episodes from Pascual Jordan's biography including his
pivotal role in the shaping of quantum field theory and his much criticized
conduct during the NS regime, I draw attention to his presentation of the first
phase of development of quantum field theory in a talk presented at the 1929
Kharkov conference. He starts by giving a comprehensive account of the
beginnings of quantum theory, emphasising that particle-like properties arise
as a consequence of treating wave-motions quantum-mechanically. He then goes on
to his recent discovery of quantization of ``wave fields'' and problems of
gauge invariance. The most surprising aspect of Jordan's presentation is
however his strong belief that his field quantization is a transitory not yet
optimal formulation of the principles underlying causal, local quantum physics.
The expectation of a future more radical change coming from the main architect
of field quantization already shortly after his discovery is certainly quite
startling. I try to answer the question to what extent Jordan's 1929
expectations have been vindicated. The larger part of the present essay
consists in arguing that Jordan's plea for a formulation without ``classical
correspondence crutches'', i.e. for an intrinsic approach (which avoids
classical fields altogether), is successfully addressed in past and recent
publications on local quantum physics.

quantum information theory. We propose a new application of this resource to
the theory of quantum measurements. According to Naimark's theorem any rank 1
generalised measurement (POVM) M may be represented as a von Neumann
measurement in an extended (tensor product) space of the system plus ancilla.
By considering a suitable average of the entanglements of these measurement
directions and minimising over all Naimark extensions, we define a notion of
entanglement cost E_min(M) of M.
  We give a constructive means of characterising all Naimark extensions of a
given POVM. We identify various classes of POVMs with zero and non-zero cost
and explicitly characterise all POVMs in 2 dimensions having zero cost. We
prove a constant upper bound on the entanglement cost of any POVM in any
dimension. Hence the asymptotic entanglement cost (i.e. the large n limit of
the cost of n applications of M, divided by n) is zero for all POVMs.
  The trine measurement is defined by three rank 1 elements, with directions
symmetrically placed around a great circle on the Bloch sphere. We give an
analytic expression for its entanglement cost. Defining a normalised cost of
any d-dimensional POVM by E_min(M)/log(d), we show (using a combination of
analytic and numerical techniques) that the trine measurement is more costly
than any other POVM with d&gt;2, or with d=2 and ancilla dimension 2. This
strongly suggests that the trine measurement is the most costly of all POVMs.

complexity of generating a quantum state that serves as a witness for a given
QMA problem. In a certain sense, FQMA is the quantum analogue of FNP (function
problems associated with NP). The latter describes the complexity of finding a
succinct proof for a NP decision problem. Whereas all FNP problems can be
reduced to NP, there is no obvious reduction of FQMA to QMA since the solution
of FQMA is a quantum state and the solution of QMA the answer yes or no.
  We consider quantum state generators that get classical descriptions of
3-local Hamiltonians on n qubits as input and prepare low energy states for
these systems as output. We show that such state generators can be used to
prepare witnesses for QMA problems. Hence low energy state preparation is
FQMA-complete. Our proofs are extensions of the proofs by Kitaev et al. and
Kempe and Regev for the QMA-completeness of k-local Hamiltonian problems. We

With the addition of superlattices it is possible to engineer states with a
specific number of atoms per site (atomic crystals), which are required for
quantum computation and the realisation of models from condensed matter
physics, including doping and spatial patterns. The same techniques can be used
to measure two-body spatial correlation functions. We illustrate these ideas

interesting multibeam generalization of the quantitative formulation of
interferometric wave-particle duality, discovered by Englert for two-beam
interferometers. The proposed generalization is an inequality that relates a
generalized measure of the fringe visibility, to certain measures of the
maximum amount of which-way knowledge that can be stored in a which-way
detector. We construct an explicit example where, with three beams in a pure
state, the scheme proposed by D\&quot;{u}rr leads to the possibility of an ideal
which-way detector, that can achieve a better path-discrimination, at the same
time as a better fringe visibility. In our opinion, this seems to be in
contrast with the intuitive idea of complementarity, as it is implemented in
the two-beams case, where an increase in path discrimination always implies a
decrease of fringe visibility, if the beams and the detector are in pure
states.

lie outside the interval [0,1]. It is characterized by a corresponding
selfadjoint operator, to be called a region or contour operator as appropriate,
which is determined by the characteristic function of that region or contour.
The spectral problem is studied for commuting families of region and contour
operators associated with concentric disks and circles of given radius a. Their
respective eigenvalues are determined as functions of a, in terms of the
Gauss-Laguerre polynomials. These polynomials provide a basis of vectors in
Hilbert space carrying the positive discrete series representations of the
algebra su(1,1)or so(2,1). The explicit relation between the spectra of
operators associated with disks and circles with proportional radii, is given
in terms of the dicrete variable Meixner polynomials.

general curvature coupling and obeying the Robin boundary conditions given on
two concentric spherical shells with radii $a $ and $b$ in the
$D+1$-dimensional global monopole background. The expressions are derived for
the Wightman function, the vacuum expectation values of the field square, the
vacuum energy density, radial and azimuthal stress components in the region
between the shells. A regularization procedure is carried out by making use of
the generalized Abel-Plana formula for the series over zeros of combinations of
the cylinder functions. This formula allows us to extract from the vacuum
expectation values the parts due to a single sphere on background of the global
monopole gravitational field, and to present the &quot;interference&quot; parts in terms
of exponentially convergent integrals, useful, in particular, for numerical
evaluations. The vacuum forces acting on the boundaries are presented as a sum
of the self--action and interaction terms. The first one contains well known
surface divergences and needs a further regularization. The interaction forces
between the spheres are finite for all values $a&lt;b$ and are attractive for a
Dirichlet scalar. The asymptotic behavior of the vacuum densities is
investigated (i) in the limits $a\to 0$ and $b\to \infty $, (ii) in the limit
$a,b\to \infty $ for fixed value $b-a$, and (iii) for small values of the
parameter associated with the solid angle deficit in global monopole geometry.
We show that in the case (ii) the results for two parallel Robin plates on the
Minkowski bulk are rederived to the leading order.

quantum mechanical and the resulting equations for the correlation functions
are similar in form to their semi-classical analogs but do not require the

an infinite hierarchy, which we truncate at a given order. We show that
time-correlation functions computed using these approximate quantum

dimensionless complex parameter, intrinsically linked to the cooperativity
parameter of optical bistability, and analogous to the scaled Rabbi frequency
for driven systems where the field is classical. Classes of steady states are
iteratively constructed and expressions for the diffusion and friction
coefficients at lowest order also derived. They have in most cases the same
mathematical form as their free-space analog. The method offers a semiclassical
explanation for two recent experiments of one atom trapping in a high Q cavity
where the excited state is significantly saturated. Our results refute both
claims of atom trapping by a quantized cavity mode, single or not. Finally, it
is argued that the parameter newly constructed, as well as the groundwork of
this method, are at least companions of the cooperativity parameter and its
mother theory. In particular, we lay the stress on the apparently more
fundamental role of our structure parameter.

If the initial state is a superposition of two different excitonic coherent

  interpretation of quantum mechanics</title><description>  One of the authors has recently propounded an SR (semantic realism) model
which shows, circumventing known no-go theorems, that an objective
(noncontextual, hence local) interpretation of quantum mechanics (QM) is
possible. We consider here compound physical systems and show why the proofs of
nonlocality of QM do not hold within the SR model. We also discuss quantum
measurement theory within this model, note that the objectification problem
disappears since the measurement of any property simply reveals its unknown
value, and show that the projection postulate can be considered as an
approximate law, valid FAPP (for all practical purposes). Finally, we provide
an intuitive justification for some unusual features of the SR model.

of the time dynamics of the spin-boson model in the Ohmic regime. We observe
non-Markovian effects at zero temperature that scale with the system-bath
coupling strength and cause qualitative changes in the evolution of coherence
at intermediate times of order of the oscillation period. These changes could
significantly affect the performance of these systems as qubits. In the biased
case, we find a prompt loss of coherence at these intermediate times, whose
decay rate is set by $\sqrt{\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is the coupling strength
to the environment. These calculations indicate precision experimental tests
that could confirm or refute the validity of the spin-boson model in a variety

via a photoassociation or Feshbach resonance applied to a degenerate Bose-Fermi
mixture of atoms. This problem raises an interest because, unlike bosons,
fermions in general do not behave cooperatively, so that the collective
conversion of, say, two million atoms into one million molecules is not to be
expected. Nevertheless, we find that the coupled Fermi system displays
collective Rabi-like oscillations and adiabatic passage between atoms and
molecules, thereby mimicking Bose-Einstein statistics. Cooperative association
of a degenerate mixture of Bose and Fermi gases could therefore serve as a

jumps of a single trapped and laser cooled $^{88}$Sr$^+$ ion. This represents a
statistical increase of two orders of magnitude over previous similar analyses
of quantum jumps. Compared to other searches for non-randomness in quantum
mechanical processes, using quantum jumps simplifies the interpretation of data
by eliminated multi-particle effects and providing near-unit detection
efficiency of transitions. We measure the fractional reduction in the entropy
of information to be $&lt; 6.5~10^{-4}$ when the value of any interval between
quantum jumps is known. We also find that the number of runs of successively
increasing or decreasing interval times agrees with the theoretically expected
values. Furthermore, we analyze 238~000 quantum jumps from two simultaneously
confined ions and find that the number of apparently coincidental transitions
is as expected. Finally, we observe 8400 spontaneous decays of two
simultaneously trapped ions and find that the number of apparently coincidental
decays from the metastable state agrees with the expected value. We find no
evidence for short- or long-term correlations in the intervals of the quantum
jumps or in the decay of the quantum states, in agreement with quantum theory.

transmission resource (e.g. the code length, the bandwidth, the signal power)

however, the amount of information transmitted can increase even more than
twice. We present a proof-of-principle demonstration of this super-additivity
of classical capacity of a quantum channel by using the ternary symmetric

laser parameters appropriately we can induce a non vanishing phase of particles

For non-central models, the situation is more complicated. We contemplate two

the angle. This creates a problem: the barriers become &quot;translucent&quot; and the
angular potentials cease to be solvable, having the sextuple-well form for
Calogero model and the quadruple or double well form otherwise. We mimic the

uncertainty relations of Heisenberg from the ones that are obtained from
non-commutativity of operators. Conversely, the uncertainty relations can be
written in terms of this metric only, hence they can be formulated for any
physical system, including ones with non-trivial phase space. Moreover, the
metric is a key ingredient of the probability structure of continuous-time

matrices obtained are simple linear combinations of matrix elements in the

the first subexponential-size quantum circuits for the QFT over the linear
groups GL_k(q), SL_k(q), and the finite groups of Lie type, for any fixed prime

unitary evolution. Here we analyze both non-degenerate as well as degenerate
states. Starting with the non-degenerate case, we show that the usual procedure
of subtracting the dynamical phase from the total phase to yield the geometric
phase for pure states, does not hold for mixed states. To this end, we furnish
an expression for the geometric phase that is gauge invariant. The parallelity
conditions are shown to be easily derivable from this expression. We also
extend our formalism to states that exhibit degeneracies. Here with the
holonomy taking on a non-abelian character, we provide an expression for the
geometric phase that is manifestly gauge invariant. As in the case of the
non-degenerate case, the form also displays the parallelity conditions clearly.
Finally, we furnish explicit examples of the geometric phases for both the
non-degenerate as well as degenerate mixed states.

equivocation of the channel (after removing trivial redundancy), even when
unlimited noiseless bidirectional side communication is allowed.
  By a well-known reduction, this result provides a lower bound on the

  via Wigner's little groups</title><description>  The 20th-century physics starts with Einstein and ends with Feynman. Einstein
introduced the Lorentz-covariant world with E = mc^{2}. Feynman observed that
fast-moving hadrons consist of partons which act incoherently with external
signals. If quarks and partons are the same entities observed in different
Lorentz frames, the question then is why partons are incoherent while quarks
are coherent. This is the most puzzling question Feynman left for us to solve.
In this report, we discuss Wigner's role in settling this question. Einstein's
E = mc^{2}, which takes the form E = \sqrt{m^{2} + p^{2}}, unifies the
energy-momentum relations for massive and massless particles, but it does not
take into account internal space-time structure of relativistic particles. It
is pointed out Wigner's 1939 paper on the inhomogeneous Lorentz group defines
particle spin and gauge degrees of freedom in the Lorentz-covariant world.
Within the Wigner framework, it is shown possible to construct the internal
space-time structure for hadrons in the quark model. It is then shown that the
quark model and the parton model are two different manifestations of the same
covariant entity. It is shown therefore that the lack of coherence in Feynman's
parton picture is an effect of the Lorentz covariance.

from the critical point, entanglement gets saturated by a mass scale. Results
borrowed from conformal field theory imply irreversibility of entanglement loss
along renormalization group trajectories. Entanglement does not saturate in
higher dimensions which appears to limit the success of the density matrix

  states with definite probabilities</title><description>  The problem investigated in this paper is einselection, i. e. the selection
of mutually exclusive quantum states with definite probabilities through
decoherence. Its study is based on a theory of decoherence resulting from the
projection method in the quantum theory of irreversible processes, which is
general enough for giving reliable predictions. This approach leads to a
definition (or redefinition) of the coupling with the environment involving
only fluctuations. The range of application of perturbation calculus is then
wide, resulting in a rather general master equation.
  Two distinct cases of decoherence are then found: (i) A ``degenerate'' case
(already encountered with solvable models) where decoherence amounts
essentially to approximate diagonalization; (ii) A general case where the
einselected states are essentially classical. They are mixed states. Their
density operators are proportional to microlocal projection operators (or
``quasi projectors'') which were previously introduced in the quantum
expression of classical properties.
  It is found at various places that the main limitation in our understanding
of decoherence is the lack of a systematic method for constructing collective
observables.

quantum Loschmidt echoes, i.e. various properties of the so called echo
dynamics -- the composition of forward and backward time evolutions generated
by two slightly different Hamiltonians, such as the state autocorrelation
function (fidelity) and the purity of a reduced density matrix traced over a
subsystem (purity fidelity). Our main theoretical result is a linear response
formalism, expressing the fidelity and purity fidelity in terms of integrated
time autocorrelation function of the generator of the perturbation.
Surprisingly, this relation predicts that the decay of fidelity is the slower
the faster the decay of correlations. In particular for a static
(time-independent) perturbation, and for non-ergodic and non-mixing dynamics
where asymptotic decay of correlations is absent, a qualitatively different and
faster decay of fidelity is predicted on a time scale 1/delta as opposed to
mixing dynamics where the fidelity is found to decay exponentially on a
time-scale 1/delta^2, where delta is a strength of perturbation. A detailed
discussion of a semi-classical regime of small effective values of Planck
constant is given where classical correlation functions can be used to predict
quantum fidelity decay. Note that the correct and intuitively expected
classical stability behavior is recovered in the classical limit, as the
perturbation and classical limits do not commute. The theoretical results are
demonstrated numerically for two models, the quantized kicked top and the
multi-level Jaynes Cummings model. Our method can for example be applied to the
stability analysis of quantum computation and quantum information processing.

recently measured EPR data from the Innsbruck collaboration. The model is based
on the idea that waves in the zero-point field convey information from the
detectors to the source, stimulating the spontaneous emission of photons with
definite polarizations. In order to match experimental data, the model is
augmented with a further local assumption that the ``master'' photon (going
back along the direction of the zero-point wave that triggered emission) will
not be detected if the polarizer is not in the same orientation as the
stimulated wave. This model predicts a ratio of coincidences to singles of 1/3
compared to standard quantum mechanics' 2/3 for the 2-fold choice of modulator
settings, and predicts that a 20-fold choice of settings will yield a
coincidence ratio of 1/40 with the SQM ratio unchanged. Such an outcome should
be easily distinguishable given the Innsbruck group's measured efficiency of
1/20 in their experiment. This model also predicts that a coincidence at
polarizer settings (a,b,t) will never be correlated with its time-retarded
complement setting, (a',b',t-2L/c), a prediction for whose test the limited

entanglement to the projection operator onto that subspace. The operator
Schmidt decomposition of the projection operator defines a string of Schmidt
coefficients for each subspace, and this string is assumed to characterize the
entanglement of the subspace, so that a first subspace is more entangled than a
second, if the Schmidt string of the second subspace majorizes the Schmidt
string of the first. The idea is applied to the antisymmetric and symmetric
tensor products of a finite-dimensional Hilbert space with itself, and also to
the tensor product of an angular momentum j with a spin 1/2. When adapted to
the subspaces of states of the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom with definite
total angular momentum (orbital plus spin), within the space of bound states
with a given total energy, this leads to a complete ordering of those subspaces

phase spaces C, by explicitly constructing Hilbert-space vector bundles over C.
We find that these vector bundles split as the direct sum of two holomorphic
vector bundles: the holomorphic tangent bundle T(C), plus a complex line bundle
N(C). Quantum states (except the vacuum) appear as tangent vectors to C. The
vacuum state appears as the fibrewise generator of N(C). Holomorphic line
bundles N(C) are classified by the elements of Pic(C), the Picard group of C.
In this way Pic(C) appears as the parameter space for nonequivalent vacua. Our
analysis is modelled on, but not limited to, the case when C is complex

  Quantum Computing Schemes</title><description>  Adiabatic limit is the presumption of the adiabatic geometric quantum
computation and of the adiabatic quantum algorithm. But in reality, the
variation speed of the Hamiltonian is finite. Here we develop a general
formulation of adiabatic quantum computing, which accurately describes the
evolution of the quantum state in a perturbative way, in which the adiabatic
limit is the zeroth-order approximation. As an application of this formulation,
non-adiabatic correction or error is estimated for several physical
implementations of the adiabatic geometric gates. A quantum computing process
consisting of many adiabatic gate operations is considered, for which the total
non-adiabatic error is found to be about the sum of those of all the gates.
This is a useful constraint on the computational power. The formalism is also
briefly applied to the adiabatic quantum algorithm.

calls. If $F$ is one-to-one and the size of its domain and range is the same,
then our problem can be formulated as follows: Given an oracle $f(a,x):
\{0,1\}^n\times\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ and a fixed (but hidden) value $a_0$, we
wish to obtain the value of $a_0$ by querying the oracle $f(a_0,x)$. Our goal
is to minimize the number of such oracle calls (the query complexity) using a
quantum mechanism.
  Two popular oracles are the EQ-oracle defined as $f(a,x)=1$ iff $x=a$ and the
IP-oracle defined as $f(a,x)= a\cdot x \mod 2$. It is also well-known that the
query complexity is $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ ($N=2^n$) for the EQ-oracle while only
O(1) for the IP-oracle. The main purpose of this paper is to fill this gap or
to investigate what causes this large difference. To do so, we introduce a
parameter $K$ as the maximum number of 1's in a single column of $T_f$ where
$T_f$ is the $N\times N$ truth-table of the oracle $f(a,x)$. Our main result
shows that the (quantum) query complexity is heavily governed by this parameter
$K$: ($i$) The query complexity is $\Omega(\sqrt{N/K})$. ($ii$) This lower
bound is tight in the sense that we can construct an explicit oracle whose
query complexity is $O(\sqrt{N/K})$. ($iii$) The tight complexity,
$\Theta(\frac{N}{K}+\log{K})$, is also obtained for the classical case. Thus,
the quantum algorithm needs a quadratically less number of oracle calls when
$K$ is small and this merit becomes larger when $K$ is large, e.g., $\log{K}$
v.s. constant when $K = cN$.

symplectic structure on phase space C, but it is independent of any complex
structure. On the contrary, the quantum theory is intimately linked with the
choice of a complex structure on C. When the latter is a complex-analytic
manifold admitting just one complex structure, there is a unique quantisation
whose classical limit is C. Then the notion of coherence is the same for all
observers. However, when C admits two or more nonbiholomorphic complex
structures, there is one different quantisation per different complex structure
on C. The lack of analyticity in transforming between nonbiholomorphic complex
structures can be interpreted as the loss of quantum-mechanical coherence under
the corresponding transformation. Observers using one complex structure
perceive as coherent the states that other observers, using a different complex
structure, do not perceive as such. This is the notion of a quantum-mechanical
duality transformation: the relativity of the notion of a quantum.

quantized in the minisuperspace. The perfect fluid is described by using the
Schutz formalism which allows to attribute dynamical degrees of freedom to
matter. A Schr\&quot;odinger-type equation is obtained where the matter variables
play the role of time. However, the signature of the kinetic term is
hyperbolic. This Schr\&quot;odinger-like equation is solved and a wave packet is
constructed. The norm of the resulting wave function comes out to be time
dependent, indicating the loss of unitarity in this model. The loss of
unitarity is due to the fact that the effective Hamiltonian is hermitian but
not self-adjoint. The expectation value and the bohmian trajectories are
evaluated leading to different cosmological scenarios, what is a consequence of
the absence of a unitary quantum structure. The consistency of this quantum
model is discussed as well as the generality of the absence of unitarity in

conventional laser as a local oscillator (LO), where the laser field outside
the cavity is a mixed state whose phase is completely unknown. Our description
is based on the standard interpretation of the quantum theory for measurement,
and accords with the experimental result in the squeezed state generation
scheme. We apply our description of BHD to continuous-variable quantum
teleportation (CVQT) with a conventional laser to analyze the CVQT experiment
[A. Furusawa et al., Science 282, 706 (1998)], whose validity has been
questioned on the ground of intrinsic phase indeterminacy of the laser field
[T. Rudolph and B.C. Sanders, Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 077903 (2001)]. We show that
CVQT with a laser is valid only if the unknown phase of the laser field is
shared among sender's LOs, the EPR state, and receiver's LO. The CVQT
experiment is considered valid with the aid of an optical path other than the
EPR channel and a classical channel, directly linking between a sender and a
receiver. We also propose a method to probabilistically generate a strongly
phase-correlated quantum state via continuous measurement of independent
lasers, which is applicable to realizing CVQT without the additional optical
path.

This paper presents a design of composite qubits to overcome both challenges.
Each qubit is encoded in the degenerate ground-state of four (or six) electrons
in a system of five quantum dots arranged in a two-dimensional pattern. This
decoherence-free subspace is immune to both collective and local decoherence,
and resists other forms of decoherence, which must raise the energy. The gate
operations for universal computation are simple and physically intuitive, and
are controlled by modifying the tunneling barriers between the dots--Control of
local magnetic fields is not required. A controlled-phase gate can be

associated cost in terms of decoherence caused by the scattering of probe
photons. Calculated signal-to-noise ratios in measurements of Larmor precession
are found to agree with experimental data for a wide range of lattice intensity
and detuning. Finally, quantum backaction is estimated by comparing the
measurement sensitivity to spin projection noise, and shown to be insignificant
in the current experiment. A continuous quantum measurement based on Faraday
spectroscopy in optical lattices may open up new possibilities for the study of
quantum feedback and classically chaotic quantum systems.

atom-mode interaction can be utilized to modify the quantum field in a cavity.
When an atom shoots through the cavity field, it is expected to experience a
trigonometric time dependence of its coupling constant. We investigate the
possibilities this offers to modify the field. As a point of comparison we use
the solvable Rosen-Zener model, which has parameter dependencies roughly
similar to the ones expected in a real cavity. We do confirm that by repeatedly
sending atoms through the cavity, we can obtain filters on the photon states.
Highly non-classical states can be obtained. We find that the Rosen-Zener model
is more sensitive to the detuning than the case of a trigonometric coupling.

(gauge) transformation acting in the corresponding state space. The
construction generalises a construction for nonlinear Schr\&quot;odinger equations.
To relate N^2 with physically motivated principles we assume: locality (i.e. it
contains no explicit derivative and no derivatives of the wave function),
separability (i.e. it acts on product states componentwise) and Poincar\'e
invariance. Furthermore we want that a positional density is invariant under
N^2. Such nonlinear transformations yield NLDE which describe physically
equivalent systems. To get 'new' systems, we extend this NLDE (gauge extension)
and present a family of NLDE which is a slight nonlinear generalisation of the
Dirac equation. We discuss and comment the fact that nonlinear evolutions are
not consistent with the usual framework of quantum theory. To develop a
corresponding extended framework one needs models for nonlinear evolutions
which also indicate possible physical consequences of nonlinearities.

the projections of photon spin operators onto the fixed frame of reference is

Bell inequalities, communication must occur between the parties. We show that
the amount of violation of a Bell inequality imposes a lower bound on the
average communication needed to produce these correlations. Moreover, for every
probability distribution there exists an optimal inequality for which the
degree of violation gives the minimal average communication. As an example, to
produce using classical resources the correlations that maximally violate the
CHSH inequality, 0.4142 bits of communication are necessary and sufficient. For
Bell tests performed on two entangled states of dimension d&gt;=3 where each party
has the choice between two measurements, our results suggest that more
communication is needed to simulate outcomes obtained from certain
non-maximally entangled states than maximally entangled ones.

over the one-way classical communication if the latter is unbounded. It is an
operational measure of (total) correlation in a quantum state. For

  measurements</title><description>  The information provided by a classical measurement is unambiguously
determined by the mutual information between the output results and the
measured quantity. However, quantum mechanically there are at least two notions
of information gathering which can be considered, one characterizing the
information provided about the initial preparation, useful in communication,
and the other characterizing the information about the final state, useful in
state-preparation and control. Here we are interested in understanding the
properties of these measures, and the information gathering capacities of
quantum and classical measurements. We provide a partial answer to the question
`in what sense does information gain increase with initial uncertainty?' by
showing that, for classical and quantum measurements which are symmetric with
respect to reversible transformations of the state space, the information gain
regarding the initial state always increases with the observer's initial
uncertainty. In addition, we calculate the capacity of all unitarily covariant
and commutative permutation-symmetric measurements for obtaining classical
information. While it is the von Neumann entropy of the effects which appears
in the latter capacity, it is the subentropy which appears in the expression
for the former.

recast the equations for molecular nonlinear optics to completely eliminate
ground-state static dipole coupling terms. Such dipoles can certainly play a
highly important role in nonlinear optical response - but equations derived by
standard methods, in which these dipoles emerge only as special cases of
transition moments, prove unnecessarily complex. It has been shown that the
elimination of ground-state static dipoles in favor of dipole shifts results in
a considerable simplification in form of the nonlinear optical
susceptibilities. In a fully quantum theoretical treatment the validity of such
a procedure has previously been verified using an expedient algorithm, whose
defense was afforded only by a highly intricate proof. In this paper it is
shown how a canonical transformation method entirely circumvents such an

authors, are reviewed and translated into the framework of the relatively new
non-distributive system of Boolean fractions (also called conditional events or
conditional propositions). This system of ordered pairs (A|B) of events A, B,
can express all of the non-Boolean aspects of quantum logic without having to
resort to a more abstract formulation like Hilbert space. Such notions as
orthogonality, superposition, simultaneous verifiability, compatibility,
orthoalgebras, orthocomplementation, modularity, and the Sasaki projection
mapping are translated into this conditional event framework and their forms
exhibited. These concepts turn out to be quite adequately expressed in this
near-Boolean framework thereby allowing more natural, intuitive interpretations
of quantum phenomena. Results include showing that two conditional propositions
are simultaneously verifiable just in case the truth of one implies the
applicability of the other. Another theorem shows that two conditional
propositions (a|b) and (c|d) reside in a common Boolean sub-algebra of the
non-distributive system of conditional propositions just in case b=d, that
their conditions are equivalent. Some concepts equivalent in standard
formulations of quantum logic are distinguishable in the conditional event
algebra, indicating the greater richness of expression possible with Boolean
fractions. Logical operations and deductions in the linear subspace logic of
quantum mechanics are compared with their counterparts in the conditional event
realm. Disjunctions and implications in the quantum realm seem to correspond in
the domain of Boolean fractions to previously identified implications with
respect to various naturally arising deductive relations.

Also, we show that the structure of any finite memory state is unimportant in

the search for allowable self-adjoint extensions. Using the laws of
conservation as necessary conditions in the singular point alongside with
account of the analytical structure of fundamental solutions, it allows us to
receive exact expressions for the wave functions (i.e. for the boundary
conditions), scattering coefficients and the singular corrections to the
potential, as well as the corresponding bound state spectrum. It turns out that
the point $\delta$-shaped correction to the potential should be present without
fail at any choice of the allowable self-adjoint extension, moreover a form of
these corrections corresponds to the form of renormalization terms obtained in
quantum electrodynamics. Thus, the proposed method shows the unequivocal
connection among the boundary conditions, scattering coefficients and
$\delta$-shaped additions to the potential. Taken as a whole, the method
demonstrates the opportunities which arise at the analysis of the self-adjoint
extensions of the appropriate Hamilton operator. And as it concerns the

walks. These dynamical systems can be chosen to display, in the classical
limit, a range of behaviors from the integrable to chaotic, or
deterministically random. As an example of an integrable coin we study the
Fourier walk that generalizes the Hadamard walk and show that the walker slows
down with coin dimensionality, which controls the effective Planck constant.
Introducing multi-Harper maps as deterministic models of random walks we study
the effect of coin chaos on the quantum walk. We also demonstrate that breaking
time-reversal symmetry in the coin dynamics effectively slows down the walk.

computational logics. The basic semantic idea is the following: the meaning of
a sentence is identified with a quregister, a system of qubits, representing a
possible pure state of a compound quantum system. The generalization to mixed
states, which might be useful to analyse entanglement-phenomena, is due to
Gudder. Quantum computational logics represent non standard examples of unsharp
quantum logic, where the non-contradiction principle is violated, while
conjunctions and disjunctions are strongly non-idempotent. In this framework,
any sentence of the language gives rise to a quantum tree: a kind of quantum
circuit that transforms the quregister associated to the atomic subformulas of
the sentence into the quregister associated to the sentence.

  operational delays</title><description>  Ideal quantum algorithms usually assume that quantum computing is performed
continuously by a sequence of unitary transformations. However, there always
exist idle finite time intervals between consecutive operations in a realistic
quantum computing process. During these delays, coherent &quot;errors&quot; will
accumulate from the dynamical phases of the superposed wave functions. Here we
explore the sensitivity of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm to such errors.
Our results clearly show a severe sensitivity of Shor's factorization algorithm
to the presence of delay times between successive unitary transformations.
Specifically, in the presence of these {\it coherent &quot;errors&quot;}, the probability
of obtaining the correct answer decreases exponentially with the number of
qubits of the work register. A particularly simple phase-matching approach is
proposed in this paper to {\it avoid} or suppress these {\it coherent errors}
when using Shor's algorithm to factorize integers. The robustness of this
phase-matching condition is evaluated analytically or numerically for the
factorization of several integers: $4, 15, 21$, and 33.

which consists of one linear retarder and one rotator only, both of which are
uniquely determined. This has many useful applications in the field of Optics
of Polarized Light. In particular, it arises naturally in attempts to
reconstruct spatially varying refractive tensors or dielectric tensors from
measurements of the change of state of polarization of light beams passing
through the medium, a field which is known as Tensor Tomography. A special case
is Photoelasticity, where the internal stress of a transparent material may be
reconstructed from knowledge of the local optical tensors by using the
stress-optical laws. - We present a rigorous approach to the Poincare
Equivalence Theorem by explicitly proving a matrix decomposition theorem, from
which the Poincare Equivalence Theorem follows as a corollary. To make the
paper self-contained we supplement a brief account of the Jones matrix
formalism, at least as far as linear retarders and rotators are concerned. We
point out the connection between the parameters of the Poincare-equivalent
model to previously introduced notions of the Characteristic Parameters of an
optical model in the engineering literature. Finally, we briefly illustrate how

unitary transformation formulation, the present paper obtains the exact
solutions to the time-dependent supersymmetric two-level multiphoton
Jaynes-Cummings model and the Chiao-Wu model that describes the propagation of
a photon inside the optical fiber. On the basis of the fact that the two-level
multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings model possesses the supersymmetric structure, an
invariant is constructed in terms of the supersymmetric generators by working
in the sub-Hilbert-space corresponding to a particular eigenvalue of the
conserved supersymmetric generators (i.e., the time-independent invariant). By
constructing the effective Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the
photon with the medium of the optical fiber, it is further verified that the
particular solution to the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation is the eigenfunction of the
second-quantized momentum operator of photons field. This, therefore, means
that the explicit expression (rather than the hidden form that involves the
chronological product) for the time-evolution operator of wave function is
obtained by means of the invariant theories.

the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the effective Hamiltonian of an open
quantum system. A generalized expression $\tilde q_k(E)$ for the Fano parameter
of the resonance state $k$ is derived that contains the interaction of the
state $k$ with neighboured states $l\ne k$ via the continuum. It is energy
dependent since the coupling coefficients between the state $k$ and the
continuum show a resonance-like behaviour at the energies of the neighboured
states $l\ne k$. Under certain conditions, the energy dependent $\tilde q_k(E)$
are equivalent to the generalized complex energy independent Fano parameters
that are introduced by Kobayashi et al. in analyzing experimental data.
Long-lived states appear mostly isolated from one another in the cross section,
also when they are overlapped by short-lived resonance states. The $\tilde
q_k(E)$ of narrow resonances allow therefore to study the complicated interplay
between different time scales in the regime of overlapping resonance states by
controlling them as a function of an external parameter.

Kondo state exhibiting a single-peak Kondo resonance to another exhibiting a
double peak by increasing the inter-dot-coupling (t) in a parallel-coupled DQD.
The transition into the double-peak state provides evidence for
spin-entanglement between the excess-electron on each dot. Toward the
transition, the peak splitting merges and becomes substantially smaller than t
because of strong Coulomb effects. Our device tunability bodes well for future
quantum computation applications.

  quantum dot qubits</title><description>  A quantum dot spin LED provides a test of carrier spin injection into a
qubit, as well as a means of analyzing carrier spin injection in general and
local spin polarization. The polarization of the observed light is, however,
significantly influenced by the dot geometry so the spin may be more polarized
than the emitted light would naively suggest. We have calculated carrier
polarization-dependent optical matrix elements using 8-band strain-dependent
k.p theory for InAs/GaAs self-assembled quantum dots (SAQDs) for electron and
hole spin injection into a range of quantum dot sizes and shapes, and for
arbitrary emission directions. The observed circular polarization does not
depend on whether the injected spin-polarized carriers are electrons or holes,
but is strongly influenced by the SAQD geometry and emission direction.
Calculations for typical SAQD geometries with emission along [110] show light
that is only ~5% circularly polarized for spin states that are 100% polarized
along [110]. Therefore observed polarizations [Chye et al. PRB 66, 201301(R)]
of ~1% imply a spin polarization within the dot of ~20%. We also find that
measuring along the growth direction gives near unity conversion of spin to
photon polarization, and is the least sensitive to uncertainties in SAQD
geometry.

this state of affairs are psychological and neurobiological. The processes by
which the visual world is constructed by our minds, predispose us towards
concepts of space, time, and substance that are inconsistent with the
spatiotemporal and substantial aspects of the quantum world. In the first part
of this chapter, the latter are extracted from the quantum formalism. The
nature of a world that is fundamentally and irreducibly described by a
probability algorithm is determined. The neurobiological processes responsible
for the mismatch between our &quot;natural&quot; concepts of space, time, and substance
and the corresponding aspects of the quantum world are discussed in the second
part. These natural concepts give rise to pseudoproblems that foil our attempts
to make ontological sense of quantum mechanics. If certain psychologically
motivated but physically unwarranted assumptions are discarded (in particular
our dogged insistence on obtruding upon the quantum world the intrinsically and
completely differentiated spatiotemporal background of classical physics), we

electrons, neutrinos and protons as particles bound by their own potentials.
Classical electromagnetism and the Dirac electron theory appear to be natural
extensions of the physics that rules the electron itself. However, the charge
density and the negative energy eigenvalues are two concepts which cannot
survive further scrutiny. The electron and the proton resemble minute planetary
systems where the bispinor terms defining their physical properties revolve
with definite angular momentum around the singular point of the particles'
potentials. The mass of the electron--neutrino in relation to the electron's
and the mass of the latter in relation to the proton's are determined under
particular assumptions. The most important feature of the new approach is the
faithful representation of free particles at rest with respect to inertial
systems of reference. This certainly enhances the foundation of physics;
precisely in the realm of Quantum Mechanics, where the customary description of
free electrons is a confusing consequence of the limited scope of the
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger and Dirac equations.

about an interface between equations of motion and the stillness of
experimental records. Here we delineate an interface between wave functions as
language to describe motion and Turing tapes as language to describe
experimental records. After extending quantum formalism to make this interface
explicit, we report on constraints and freedoms in choosing quantum-mechanical
equations to model experiments with devices. We prove that choosing equations
of wave functions and operators to achieve a fit between calculated
probabilities and experimental records requires reaching beyond both logic and
the experimental records. Although informed by experience, a &quot;reach beyond&quot; can
fairly be called a guess.
  Recognizing that particles as features of wave functions depend on guesswork,
we introduce their use not as objects of physical investigation but as elements
of thought in quantum-mechanical models of devices. We make informed guesses to
offer a quantum-mechanical model of a 1-bit recording device in a metastable
condition. Probabilities calculated from the model fit an experimental record
of an oscillation in a time-varying probability, showing a
temperature-independent role for Planck's constant in what heretofore was
viewed as a &quot;classical&quot; electronic device.

representing this system. Based on the notions of an information state, an
information state space and a generalized observable, this general framework
covers the description of a wide range of experimental situations including
those where, with respect to a system, an experiment is perturbing. We prove
that, to any experiment upon a system, there corresponds a unique generalized
observable on a system initial information state space, which defines the
probability distribution of outcomes under this experiment. We specify the case
where initial information on a system provides &quot;no knowledge&quot; for the
description of an experiment. Incorporating in a uniform way the basic notions
of conventional probability theory and the non-commutativity aspects and the
basic notions of quantum measurement theory, our framework clarifies the
principle difference between Kolmogorov's model in probability theory and the
statistical model of quantum theory. Both models are included into our
framework as particular cases. We show that the phenomenon of &quot;reduction&quot; of a
system initial information state is inherent, in general, to any
non-destructive experiment and upon a system of any type. Based on our general
framework, we introduce the probabilistic model for the description of
non-destructive experiments upon a quantum system and prove that positive
bounded linear mappings on the Banach space of trace class operators, arising
in the description of experiments upon a quantum system, are completely
positive.

Gravity (LQG). Seven years ago a mathematically consistent candidate
Hamiltonian constraint has been proposed but there are still several unsettled
questions which concern the algebra of commutators among smeared Hamiltonian
constraints which must be faced in order to make progress. In this paper we
propose a solution to this set of problems based on the so-called {\bf Master
Constraint} which combines the smeared Hamiltonian constraints for all smearing
functions into a single constraint. If certain mathematical conditions, which
still have to be proved, hold, then not only the problems with the commutator
algebra could disappear, also chances are good that one can control the
solution space and the (quantum) Dirac observables of LQG. Even a decision on
whether the theory has the correct classical limit and a connection with the
path integral (or spin foam) formulation could be in reach. While these are
exciting possibilities, we should warn the reader from the outset that, since
the proposal is, to the best of our knowledge, completely new and has been
barely tested in solvable models, there might be caveats which we are presently
unaware of and render the whole {\bf Master Constraint Programme} obsolete.
Thus, this paper should really be viewed as a proposal only, rather than a
presentation of hard results, which however we intend to supply in future
submissions.

systems are identical or not. This paper treats both error-free comparison, and
comparison where errors in the result are allowed. Error-free comparison means
that we aim to obtain definite answers, which are known to be correct, as often
as possible. In general, we will have to accept also inconclusive results,
giving no information. To obtain a definite answer that the states of the
systems are not identical is always possible, whereas, in the situation
considered here, a definite answer that they are identical will not be
possible. The optimal universal error-free comparison strategy is a projection
onto the totally symmetric and the different non-symmetric subspaces, invariant
under permutations and unitary transformations. We also show how to construct
optimal comparison strategies when allowing for some errors in the result,
minimising either the error probability, or the average cost of making an
error. We point out that it is possible to realise universal error-free
comparison strategies using only linear elements and particle detectors, albeit
with less than ideal efficiency. Also minimum-error and minimum-cost strategies
may sometimes be realised in this way. This is of great significance for
practical applications of quantum comparison.

fundamental issues of quantum mechanics such as the measurement process. At the
same time electrodynamically trapped ions have been used with great success to
demonstrate quantum logic operations and are a candidate for scalable quantum
computing. In this article a brief introduction is given to the basic steps
that constitute a quantum measurement; in particular, measurements on single
quantum systems are considered. Then experiments with single Yb+ are reviewed
demonstrating the quantum Zeno paradox, as well as an experiment where an
adaptive algorithm for quantum state estimation of qubits was implemented. In
the last section of this article -- devoted to experiments and new ideas
related to quantum information processing (QIP) with trapped ions -- the
realization of various quantum channels using a hyperfine qubit of Yb+ is
briefly discussed. Then a concept for QIP with trapped ions is reviewed where
rf or microwave radiation is used instead of laser light for coherent
manipulation of a collection of ions. In a suitably modified trap the ions form
an artificial ion &quot;molecule&quot; to which the techniques developed in nuclear
magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance experiments can be directly
applied. Finally, coherent excitation of optical electric quadrupole
transitions in Yb+ and Ba+ is reported. In addition, robust Raman cooling of a
pair of Ba+ ions is reviewed.

fields, which has been called ``homeotic.'' We show for this case, as is true
in general for hybrid Dirac fields (except the ordinary fields whose
annihilation and creation parts both obey one or the other Dirac equation),
that (1) any interacting theory violates both Lorentz covariance and causality,
(2) the discrete transformations $\mathcal{C}$, and $\mathcal{CPT}$ map the
pair $\psi_h(x)$ and $\bar{\psi}_h(x)$ into fields that are not linear
combinations of this pair, and (3) the chiral projections of $\psi_h(x)$ are
sums of the usual Dirac fields with masses $m$ and $-m$; on these chiral
projections $\mathcal{C}$, and $\mathcal{CPT}$ are defined in the usual way,
their interactions do not violate $\mathcal{CPT}$, and interactions of chiral
projections are Lorentz covariant and causal. In short, the main claims
concerning ``homeotic'' fields are incorrect.

the oscillations of the distribution and the parity behavior are derived and
compared with the exact results. The accuracy is verified and it is shown that
for high photon number it fails to reproduce the true distribution. This is
contrasted with the fact that for moderate squeezing the WKB approximation
gives the analytical justification to the interpretation of the oscillations as
the result of the interference of areas with definite phases in phase space. It
is shown with a computation at high squeezing using a modified prescription for
the phase space representation which is based on Wigner-Cohen distributions
that the failure of the WKB approximation does not invalidate the area overlap

essentially equally secure when the adversary's memory is allowed to be r

D.J. Wineland {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. A {\bf 50}, 67 (1994)] give different
predictions of entanglement in the two-atom Dicke system. We analyze
differences between the definitions and show that the Kitagawa and Ueda's spin
squeezing parameter is a better measure of entanglement than the commonly used
spectroscopic spin squeezing parameter. We illustrate this relation by
examining different examples of a driven two-atom Dicke system in which spin
squeezing and entanglement arise dynamically. We give an explanation of the
source of the difference in the prediction of entanglement using the negativity
criterion for entanglement. For the examples discussed, we find that the
Kitagawa and Ueda's spin squeezing parameter is the sufficient and necessary
condition for entanglement.

intense laser dissociation, based on angularly resolved photodissociation
spectra recently recorded in H.Figger's group. As opposite to other
experimental setups, it is an electric discharge (and not an optical

theoretical approach, to neglect without lost of accuracy, the otherwise
important ionization-dissociation competition. Abel transformation relates the
dissociation probability starting from a single ro-vibrational state, to the
probability of observing a hydrogen atom at a given pixel of the detector
plate. Some statistics on initial ro-vibrational distributions, together with a
spatial averaging over laser focus area, lead to photofragments kinetic
spectra, with well separated peaks attributed to single vibrational levels. An
excellent theory-versus-experiment agreement is reached not only for the
kinetic spectra, but also for the angular distributions of fragments
originating from two different vibrational levels resulting into more or less
alignment. Some characteristic features can be interpreted in terms of basic
mechanisms such as bond softening or vibrational trapping.

the free-evolution dilations minimize the physical resources needed to realize
the QO, and for this case we provide bounds for the dimension of the ancilla

correspond to the customary ancilla-system interaction realization, and for

particle into account, since particles were much smaller than the width of the
slits in early observations. In recent experiments with large molecules, the
diameter of the particle has approached the width of the slits. Therefore,
analytical description of these cases should include a finite particle size.
The generic quantum interference setup is an asymmetric double slit
interferometer. We evaluate the wave function of the particle transverse motion
using two forms of the solution of Schrodinger's equation in an asymmetric
interferometer: the Fresnel-Kirchhoff form and the form derived from the
transverse wave function in the momentum representation. The transverse
momentum distribution is independent of the distance from the slits, while the
space distribution strongly depends on this distance. Based on the transverse
momentum distribution we determined the space distribution of particles behind
the slits. We will present two cases: a) when the diameter of the particle may
be neglected with respect to the width of both slits, and b) when the diameter
of the particle is larger than the width of the smaller slit.

from the Schroedinger equation. This assumes the two formalisms are equivalent.
Since time plays a very different role in the Schroedinger equation and in path
integrals, this may not be the case.
  We here derive path integrals directly by imposing two requirements: correct
behavior in the classical limit and the most complete practicable symmetry
between time and space.
  With these requirements, the path integral formalism predicts quantum
fluctuations over the time dimension analogous to the quantum fluctuations seen
over the three space dimensions. For constant potentials there is no effect.
But the coupling between rapidly varying electromagnetic fields and the quantum
fluctuations in time should be detectable.
  We consider a variation on the Stern-Gerlach experiment in which a particle
with a non-zero electric dipole moment is sent through a rapidly varying
electric field, oriented parallel to the particle's trajectory. The
Schroedinger equation predicts changes to the precession frequency of the wave
function about the trajectory but no physical splitting of the beam. With the
approach here, path integrals predict the changes to the precession frequency
and in addition that the beam will be split in velocity and time.

out that a clock as an external classical device associated with the observer
plays an essential role. This leads me to postulate a ``principle of the
integrity of the observer''. It essentially requires the observer to be part of
a classical domain connected throughout the measurement process. Mathematically
this naturally leads to a formulation of quantum mechanics as a kind of
topological quantum field theory. Significantly, quantities with a direct

amplitudes for connected boundaries of compact regions of space-time. I discuss

presence of entanglement or classical correlation on certain pairs of qubits
may imply correlations on other pairs. We present a method of characterization
of bi-partite correlations in multi-qubit systems using a concept of entangled
graphs that has been introduced in our earlier work [M.Plesch and V.Buzek,
Phys. Rev. A 67, 012322 (2003)]. In entangled graphs each qubit is represented
by a vertex while the entanglement and classical correlations are represented
by two types of edges. We prove by construction that any entangled graph with
classical correlations can be represented by a mixed state of N qubits.
However, not all entangled graphs with classical correlations can be
represented by a pure state.

the much studied problem of &quot;direction finding&quot; that is asymptotically
equivalent (up to polylog factors) to the optimal average case fidelity

rotation gates of magnitude $\pi/2^{2L}$ where $L$ is the binary length of the
integer N to be factored. Such gates cannot be implemented exactly using
existing fault-tolerant techniques. Approximating a given controlled
$\pi/2^{d}$ rotation gate to within $\delta=O(1/2^{d})$ currently requires both
a number of qubits and number of fault-tolerant gates that grows polynomially
with $d$. In this paper we show that this additional growth in space and time
complexity would severely limit the applicability of Shor's algorithm to large
integers. Consequently, we study in detail the effect of using only controlled
rotation gates with $d$ less than or equal to some $d_{\rm max}$. It is found
that integers up to length $L_{\rm max} = O(4^{d_{\rm max}})$ can be factored
without significant performance penalty implying that the cumbersome techniques
of fault-tolerant computation only need to be used to create controlled
rotation gates of magnitude $\pi/64$ if integers thousands of bits long are
desired factored. Explicit fault-tolerant constructions of such gates are also
discussed.

operator acting in a Hilbert space \tilde H. We determine all the
positive-definite inner products on the space H of the solutions of such an
equation and establish their physical equivalence. We use a simple realization
of the unique Hilbert space structure on H to construct the observables of the
theory explicitly. In general, there are infinitely many choices for the
Hamiltonian each leading to a different notion of time-evolution in H. Among
these is a particular choice that generates t-translations in H and identifies
t with time whenever D is t-independent. For a t-dependent D, we show that
t-translations never correspond to unitary evolutions in H, and t cannot be
identified with time. We apply these ideas to develop a formulation of quantum
cosmology based on the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a Friedman-Robertson-Walker
model coupled to a real scalar field. We solve the Hilbert space problem,
construct the observables, introduce a new set of the wave functions of the
universe, reformulate the quantum theory in terms of the latter, reduce the
problem of time to the determination of a Hamiltonian operator acting in
L^2(\R)\oplus L^2(\R), show that the factor-ordering problem is irrelevant for
the kinematics of the quantum theory, and propose a formulation of the

model. This representation is based on two fundamental observables -- in the
standard quantum model these are position and momentum observables. This
representation has all distinguishing features of the quantum model. Thus in
spite all ``No-Go'' theorems (e.g., von Neumann, Kochen and Specker,..., Bell)
we found the realist basis for quantum mechanics. Our representation is not
standard model with hidden variables. In particular, this is not a reduction of
quantum model to the classical one. Moreover, we see that such a reduction is
even in principle impossible. This impossibility is not a consequence of a
mathematical theorem but it follows from the physical structure of the model.
By our model quantum states are very rough images of domains in the space of
fundamental parameters - PRESPACE. Those domains represent complexes of
physical conditions. By our model both classical and quantum physics describe
REDUCTION of PRESPACE-INFORMATION. Quantum mechanics is not complete. In

  Bounds on the generated entropy</title><description>  We describe separable joint states on bipartite quantum systems that cannot
be prepared by any thermodynamically reversible classical one-way communication
protocol. We argue that the joint state of two synchronized microscopic clocks
is always of this type when it is considered from the point of view of an
``ignorant'' observer who is not synchronized with the other two parties.
  We show that the entropy generation of a classical one-way synchronization
protocol is at least \Delta S = \hbar^2/(4\Delta E \Delta t)^2 if \Delta t is
the time accuracy of the synchronism and \Delta E is the energy bandwidth of
the clocks. This dissipation can only be avoided if the common time of the
microscopic clocks is stored by an additional classical clock.
  Furthermore, we give a similar bound on the entropy cost for resetting
synchronized clocks by a classical one-way protocol. The proof relies on
observations of Zurek on the thermodynamic relevance of quantum discord. We
leave it as an open question whether classical multi-step protocols may perform
better.
  We discuss to what extent our results imply problems for classical concepts
of reversible computation when the energy of timing signals is close to the
Heisenberg limit.

discuss a thought experiment in which a Brownian particle is subjected to a

pattern, they derive a decoherence rate that is much faster than previous
results and even persists in the limit of vanishing dissipation. This result is
based on the definition of a certain attenuation factor, which they analyze for
short times. In this note, we point out that this attenuation factor captures
the physics of decoherence only for times larger than a certain time t_mix,
which is the time it takes until the two emerging wave packets begin to
overlap. Therefore, the strategy of Ford et al of extracting the decoherence
time from the regime t &lt; t_mix is in our opinion not meaningful. If one
analyzes the attenuation factor for t &gt; t_mix, one recovers familiar behaviour
for the decoherence time; in particular, no decoherence is seen in the absence
of dissipation. The latter conclusion is confirmed with a simple calculation of
the off-diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix.

requires a collective quantum measurement. Recently, the first experimental
demonstration was reported [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 167906 (2003)]. The purpose of
this paper is to describe our experiment in detail. Particularly, a design
strategy of quantum collective decoding in physical quantum circuits is
emphasized. We also address the practical implication of the gain on
communication performance by introducing the quantum-classical hybrid coding
scheme. We show how the superadditive quantum coding gain, even in a small code

  force between real metals</title><description>  The surface impedance approach to the description of the thermal Casimir
effect in the case of real metals is elaborated starting from the free energy
of oscillators. The Lifshitz formula expressed in terms of the dielectric
permittivity depending only on frequency is shown to be inapplicable in the
frequency region where a real current may arise leading to Joule heating of the
metal. The standard concept of a fluctuating electromagnetic field on such
frequencies meets difficulties when used as a model for the zero-point
oscillations or thermal photons in the thermal equilibrium inside metals.
Instead, the surface impedance permits not to consider the electromagnetic
oscillations inside the metal but taking the realistic material properties into
account by means of the effective boundary condition. An independent derivation
of the Lifshitz-type formulas for the Casimir free energy and force between two
metal plates is presented within the impedance approach. It is shown that they
are free of the contradictions with thermodynamics which are specific to the
usual Lifshitz formula for dielectrics in combination with the Drude model. We
demonstrate that in the impedance approach the zero-frequency contribution is
uniquely fixed by the form of impedance function and does not need any of the
ad hoc prescriptions intensively discussed in the recent literature. As an
example, the computations of the Casimir free energy between two gold plates
are performed at different separations and temperatures. It is argued that the
surface impedance approach lays a reliable framework for the future
measurements of the thermal Casimir force.

  information</title><description>  When a measurement is made on a quantum system in which classical information
is encoded, the measurement reduces the observers average Shannon entropy for
the encoding ensemble. This reduction, being the {\em mutual information}, is
always non-negative. For efficient measurements the state is also purified;
that is, on average, the observers von Neumann entropy for the state of the
system is also reduced by a non-negative amount. Here we point out that by
re-writing a bound derived by Hall [Phys. Rev. A {\bf 55}, 100 (1997)], which
is dual to the Holevo bound, one finds that for efficient measurements, the
mutual information is bounded by the reduction in the von Neumann entropy. We
also show that this result, which provides a physical interpretation for Hall's
bound, may be derived directly from the Schumacher-Westmoreland-Wootters
theorem [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 76}, 3452 (1996)]. We discuss these bounds, and
their relationship to another bound, valid for efficient measurements on pure
state ensembles, which involves the subentropy.

pseudo-telepathy when quantum entanglement serves to eliminate the classical

between nuclear spins of spin-carrying molecules of a gas in a closed
nano-cavities are independent of the spacing between all spins. We derive exact
time-dependent polarization for all spins in spin-1/2 ensemble with spatially
independent effective dipolar interactions. If the initial polarization is on a
single (first) spin,$P_1(0)= 1$ then the exact spin dynamics of the model is
shown to exhibit a periodical short pulses of the polarization of the first
spin, the effect being typical of the systems having a large number, $N$, of
spins. If $N \gg 1$, then within the period $4\pi/g$ ($2\pi/g$) for odd (even)
$N$-spin clusters, with $g$ standing for spin coupling, the polarization of
spin 1 switches quickly from unity to the time independent value, 1/3, over the
time interval about $(g\sqrt{N})^{-1}$, thus, almost all the time, the spin 1
spends in the time independent condition $P_1(t)= 1/3$. The period and the
width of the pulses determine the volume and the form-factor of the ellipsoidal
cavity. The formalism is adopted to the case of time varying nano-fluctuations
of the volume of the cavitation nano-bubbles. If the volume $V(t)$ is varied by
the Gaussian-in-time random noise then the envelope of the polarization peaks
goes irreversibly to 1/3. The polarization dynamics of the single spin exhibits
the Gaussian (or exponential) time dependence when the correlation time of the
fluctuations of the nano-volume is larger (or smaller) than the $&lt;(\delta g)^2

The SQDS can be regarded as two qubits trying to acquire which way information

Furthermore, there exists a representation of the group of generalised
spacetime mappings that are functionals of the four-metric: this is a spacetime
analogue of the group originally defined by Bergmann and Komar in the context
of the canonical formulation of general relativity. Finally, we discuss the
possible directions for the quantization of gravity in histories theory.

  oscillator!</title><description>  Nambu's construction of multi-linear brackets for super-integrable systems
can be thought of as degenerate Poisson brackets with a maximal set of Casimirs
in their kernel. By introducing privileged coordinates in phase space these
degenerate Poisson brackets are brought to the form of Heisenberg's equations.
We propose a definition for constructing quantum operators for classical
functions which enables us to turn the maximally degenerate Poisson brackets
into operators. They pose a set of eigenvalue problems for a new state vector.
The requirement of the single valuedness of this eigenfunction leads to
quantization. The example of the harmonic oscillator is used to illustrate this
general procedure for quantizing a class of maximally super-integrable systems.

  This result yields information--theoretic formulas for the distillable secret

  Specialising our protocol somewhat and making it coherent leads us to a
protocol of entanglement distillation via one-way LOCC (local operations and
classical communication) which is asymptotically optimal: in fact we prove the
so-called &quot;hashing inequality&quot; which says that the coherent information (i.e.,

  This result is well--known to imply a whole set of distillation and capacity

  Measurements</title><description>  A model is proposed for the statistical analysis of arbitrary-strength
quantum measurements, based on a picture of &quot;sampling weak values&quot; from
different configurations of the system. The model is comprised of two elements:
a &quot;local weak value&quot; and a &quot;likelihood factor&quot;. The first describes the
response of an idealized weak measurement situation where the back-reaction on
the system is perfectly controlled. The second assigns a weight factor to
possible configurations of the system. The distribution of the data in a
measurement of arbitrary strength may the be viewed as the net result of
interfering different samples weighted by the likelihood factor, each of which
implements a weak measurement of a different local weak value. It is shown that
the mean and variance of the data can be connected directly to the means and
variances of the sampled weak values. The model is then applied to a situation
similar to a phase transition, where the distribution of the data exhibits two
qualitatively different shapes as the strength parameter is slightly varied
away from a critical value: one below the critical point, where an unusual weak
value is resolved, the other above the critical point, where the spectrum of
the measured observable is resolved. In the picture of sampling, the transition
corresponds to a qualitative change in the sampling profile brought about by
the competition between the prior sampling distribution and the likelihood
factor.

effects that probe not just the quantum nature of the islands, but also of the
superconducting reservoir coupled to them. These are analogues to the
well-known quantum optical effects `superradiance,' and `revival.' When revival
is extended to multiple systems, we find that `entanglement revival' can also

simplified model for these systems in which all the single-electron energy
eigenvalues are set to be the same (the strong coupling limit), as are the
charging energies of the Cooper Pair Boxes, allowing the whole system to be
represented by two large coupled quantum spins. Although this simplification is

of interest. Given the progress in superconducting box experiments over recent

models with a stable groundstate in the continuum limit. This is demonstrated
in several examples, recovering and generalizing a model advanced by 't Hooft.

particular for an important special case of a vanishing time averaged
perturbation operator, i.e. vanishing expectation values of the perturbation in
the eigenbasis of unperturbed dynamics. A complete semiclassical picture of
this situation is derived in which we show that the quantum fidelity of
individual coherent initial states exhibits three different regimes in time:
(i) first it follows the corresponding classical fidelity up to time
t1=hbar^(-1/2), (ii) then it freezes on a plateau of constant value, (iii) and
after a time scale t_2=min[hbar^(1/2) delta^(-2),hbar^(-1/2) delta^(-1)] it
exhibits fast ballistic decay as exp(-const. delta^4 t^2/hbar) where delta is a
strength of perturbation. All the constants are computed in terms of classical
dynamics for sufficiently small effective value hbar of the Planck constant. A
similar picture is worked out also for general initial states, and specifically
for random initial states, where t_1=1, and t_2=delta^(-1). This prolonged
stability of quantum dynamics in the case of a vanishing time averaged
perturbation could prove to be useful in designing quantum devices. Theoretical
results are verified by numerical experiments on the quantized integrable top.

  Magnetic Resonance: Implementation of a Quantum Algorithm</title><description>  Physical implementation of Quantum Information Processing (QIP) by
liquid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), using weakly coupled spin-1/2
nuclei of a molecule, is well established. Nuclei with spin$&gt;$1/2 oriented in
liquid crystalline matrices is another possibility. Such systems have multiple
qubits per nuclei and large quadrupolar couplings resulting in well separated
lines in the spectrum. So far, creation of pseudopure states and logic gates
have been demonstrated in such systems using transition selective
radio-frequency pulses. In this paper we report two novel developments. First,
we implement a quantum algorithm which needs coherent superposition of states.
Second, we use evolution under quadrupolar coupling to implement multi qubit
gates. We implement Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm on a spin-3/2 (2 qubit) system. The
controlled-not operation needed to implement this algorithm has been
implemented here by evolution under the quadrupolar Hamiltonian. This method
has been implemented for the first time in quadrupolar systems. Since the
quadrupolar coupling is several orders of magnitude greater than the coupling
in weakly coupled spin-1/2 nuclei, the gate time decreases, increasing the
clock speed of the quantum computer.

  on Arrows</title><description>  In two recent papers by the author, a new approach was suggested for
quantising space-time, or space. This involved developing a procedure for
quantising a system whose configuration space--or history-theory analogue--is
the set of objects, $\Ob\Q$, in a (small) category $\Q$. The quantum states in
this approach are cross-sections of a bundle $A\leadsto\K[A]$ of Hilbert spaces
over $\Ob\Q$. The Hilbert spaces $\K[A]$, $A\in\Ob\Q$, depend strongly on the
object $A$, and have to be chosen so as to get an irreducible, faithful,
representation of the basic `category quantisation monoid'. In the present
paper, we develop a different approach in which the state vectors are
complex-valued functions on the set of {\em arrows} in $\Q$. This throws a new
light on the Hilbert bundle scheme: in particular, we recover the results of
that approach in the, physically important, example when $\Q$ is a small
category of finite sets.

study the propagation of a qubit in flat spacetime whose metric is subject to
flat quantum fluctuations with a Gaussian spectrum. We find that these
fluctuations cause two changes in the state of the qubit: they lead to a phase
drift, as well as the expected exponential suppression (decoherence) of the
off-diagonal terms in the density matrix. Secondly, we calculate the
decoherence of a qubit in a circular orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole.
The no-hair theorems suggest a quantum state for the metric in which the black
hole's mass fluctuates with a thermal spectrum at the Hawking temperature.
Again, we find that the orbiting qubit undergoes decoherence and a phase drift
that both depend on the temperature of the black hole. Thirdly, we study the
interaction of coherent and squeezed gravitational waves with a qubit in
uniform motion. Finally, we investigate the decoherence of an accelerating
qubit in Minkowski spacetime due to the Unruh effect. In this case decoherence
is not due to fluctuations in the metric, but instead is caused by coupling
(which we model with a standard Hamiltonian) between the qubit and the thermal
cloud of Unruh particles bathing it. When the accelerating qubit is entangled
with a stationary partner, the decoherence should induce a corresponding loss

systems having permutation symmetry. By the introduction of elementary
symmetric polynomials and suitable choice of a solvable sector, the algebraic
structure of sl(M+1) naturally emerges. The procedure to solve the
canonical-form condition for the two-body problem is presented in detail. It is
shown that the resulting two-body quasi-solvable model can be uniquely
generalized to the M-body system for arbitrary M under the consideration of the
GL(2,K) symmetry. An intimate relation between quantum solvability and
supersymmetry is found. With the aid of the GL(2,K) symmetry, we classify the
obtained quasi-solvable quantum many-body systems. It turns out that there are
essentially five inequivalent models of Inozemtsev type. Furthermore, we
discuss the possibility of including M-body (M&gt;=3) interaction terms without
destroying the quasi-solvability.

  Cryptography with Continuous Variables</title><description>  We discuss quantum key distribution protocols using quantum continuous
variables. We show that such protocols can be made secure against individual
gaussian attacks regardless the transmission of the optical line between Alice
and Bob. This is achieved by reversing the reconciliation procedure subsequent
to the quantum transmission, that is, using Bob's instead of Alice's data to
build the key. Although squeezing or entanglement may be helpful to improve the
resistance to noise, they are not required for the protocols to remain secure
with high losses. Therefore, these protocols can be implemented very simply by
transmitting coherent states and performing homodyne detection. Here, we show
that entanglement nevertheless plays a crucial role in the security analysis of
coherent state protocols. Every cryptographic protocol based on displaced
gaussian states turns out to be equivalent to an entanglement-based protocol,
even though no entanglement is actually present. This equivalence even holds in
the absence of squeezing, for coherent state protocols. This ``virtual''
entanglement is important to assess the security of these protocols as it
provides an upper bound on the mutual information between Alice and Bob if they
had used entanglement. The resulting security criteria are compared to the
separability criterion for bipartite gaussian variables. It appears that the
security thresholds are well within the entanglement region. This supports the
idea that coherent state quantum cryptography may be unconditionally secure.

classical definition of realism intact. That is, variables have a definite
status for all time and a measurement only tells us which value it had.
However, at present modal dynamics are only applicable to situations that are
described in the orthodox theory by projective measures. In this paper we
extend modal dynamics to include positive operator measures (POMs). That is,
for example, rather than using a complete set of orthogonal projectors, we can
use an overcomplete set of nonorthogonal projectors. We derive the conditions
under which Bell's stochastic modal dynamics for projective measures reduce to
deterministic dynamics, showing (incidentally) that Brown and Hiley's
generalization of Bohmian mechanics [quant-ph/0005026, (2000)] cannot be thus
derived. We then show how {\em deterministic} dynamics for positive operators
can also be derived. As a simple case, we consider a Harmonic oscillator, and
the overcomplete set of coherent state projectors (i.e. the Husimi POM). We
show that the modal dynamics for this POM in the classical limit correspond to
the classical dynamics, even for the nonclassical number state $\ket{n}$. This
is in contrast to the Bohmian dynamics, which for energy eigenstates, the
dynamics are always non-classical.

for quantifying the nonlocality of bipartite unitary operations. We construct a
family of unitary operators on C^n tensor C^n whose operator-Schmidt
decompositions are computed using the discrete Fourier transform. As a
corollary, we produce unitaries on C^3 tensor C^3 with operator-Schmidt number
S for every S in {1,...,9}. This corollary was unexpected, since it
contradicted reasonable conjectures of Nielsen et al [Phys. Rev. A 67 (2003)
052301] based on intuition from a striking result in the two-qubit case. By the
results of Dur, Vidal, and Cirac [Phys. Rev. Lett. 89 (2002) 057901
quant-ph/0112124], who also considered the two-qubit case, our result implies
that there are nine equivalence classes of unitaries on C^3 tensor C^3 which
are probabilistically interconvertible by (stochastic) local operations and
classical communication. As another corollary, a prescription is produced for
constructing maximally-entangled operators from biunimodular functions.
Reversing tact, we state a generalized operator-Schmidt decomposition of the
quantum Fourier transform considered as an operator C^M_1 tensor C^M_2 --&gt;
C^N_1 tensor C^N_2, with M_1 x M_2 = N_1 x N_2. This decomposition shows (by
Nielsen's bound) that the communication cost of the QFT remains maximal when a
net transfer of qudits is permitted. In an appendix, a canonical procedure is
given for removing basis-dependence for results and proofs depending on the

two-state model and a dipole approximation are used. In the case of degenerate
energy levels an analytical solution of the time-dependent Shroedinger equation

choose the ratio of the field amplitude to its frequency that leads to temporal

  encryption and protection of quantum information</title><description>  Quantum information is a valuable resource which can be encrypted in order to
protect it. We consider the size of the one-time pad that is needed to protect
quantum information in a number of cases. The situation is dramatically
different from the classical case: we prove that one can recycle the one-time
pad without compromising security. The protocol for recycling relies on
detecting whether eavesdropping has occurred, and further relies on the fact
that information contained in the encrypted quantum state cannot be fully
accessed. We prove the security of recycling rates when authentication of
quantum states is accepted, and when it is rejected. We note that recycling
schemes respect a general law of cryptography which we prove relating the size
of private keys, sent qubits, and encrypted messages. We discuss applications
for encryption of quantum information in light of the resources needed for
teleportation. Potential uses include the protection of resources such as
entanglement and the memory of quantum computers. We also introduce another
application: encrypted secret sharing and find that one can even reuse the
private key that is used to encrypt a classical message. In a number of cases,
one finds that the amount of private key needed for authentication or
protection is smaller than in the general case.

Unlike the classical case, the local restrictions to intervals of length $N$
are typically mixed and have therefore a non-zero entropy $S_N$ which is,
moreover, monotonically increasing in $N$. We are interested in the asymptotics
of the total entropy. We investigate in detail a class of states derived from
quasi-free states on a CAR algebra. These are characterised by a measurable
subset of the unit interval. As the entropy density is known to vanishes, $S_N$
is sublinear in $N$. For states corresponding to unions of finitely many
intervals, $S_N$ is shown to grow slower than $(\log N)^2$. Numerical
calculations suggest a $\log N$ behaviour. For the case with infinitely many
intervals, we present a class of states for which the entropy $S_N$ increases
as $N^\alpha$ where $\alpha$ can take any value in $(0,1)$.

\hat{\rho}_F(z)$ which describes the Friedel oscillations is extracted. The
expectation value $&lt;\delta \hat{\rho}_F(z)&gt;$ with respect to the interacting

Tomonaga-Luttinger model with harmonic confinement. It is found that the
envelope of the Friedel oscillations at zero temperature decays with the
boundary exponent $\nu = (K+1)/2$ away from the classical boundaries. This

of the quanta of electric and magnetic flux of force of the electron, and
provides a new representation, which is global across all unit systems.
Consequently, a variation in alpha was shown to manifest due to a differential
change in the fraction of the quanta of electric and magnetic flux of force,
while a variation in hcross.c was shown to manifest due to the common mode
change. The representation is discussed with respect to the running of the fine
structure constant at high energies (small distances), and a putative temporal
drift. It is shown that the running of the fine structure constant is due to
equal components of electric screening (polarization of vacuum) and magnetic
anti-screening (magnetization of vacuum), which cause the perceived quanta of
electric charge to increase at small distances, while the magnetic flux quanta
decreases. This introduces the concept of the bare magnetic flux quanta as well
as the bare electric charge. With regards to temporal drift, it is confirmed
that it is impossible to determine which fundamental constant is varying if
alpha varies.

double-well potential in the strong-field regime. The system parameters have
been chosen to reproduce the $0^{-}\leftrightarrow 3^{+}$ transition of the
inversion mode of the ammonia molecule. For a molecule initially prepared in
its lower doublet we find that, under certain circumstances, the $3^{+}$ level
remains unpopulated, and this occurs in spite of the fact that the laser field
is resonant with the $0^{-}\leftrightarrow 3^{+}$ transition and intense enough
so as to strongly mix the $0^{+}$ and $0^{-}$ ground states. This
counterintuitive result constitutes a coherent population trapping phenomenon
of nonperturbative origin which cannot be accounted for with the usual models.
We propose an analytic nonperturbative model which accounts correctly for the

Zeeman shift vanishingly small for the transition. This reduces the influence

temperature correction to the Casimir force between real metals. The basic idea
was that one cannot use the dielectric permittivity in the frequency region
where a real current may arise leading to Joule heating of the metal. Instead,
the surface impedance approach is proposed as a solution of all contradictions.
The purpose of this comment is to show that (i) the main idea contradicts to
the fluctuation dissipation theorem, (ii) the proposed method to calculate the
force gives wrong value of the temperature correction since the contribution of
low frequency fluctuations is calculated with the impedance which is not
applicable at low frequencies. In the impedance approach the right result for
the reflection coefficients in the n=0 term of the Lifshitz formula is given.

  Systems</title><description>  The study of conditional $q$-entropies in composite quantum systems has
recently been the focus of considerable interest, particularly in connection
with the problem of separability. The $q$-entropies depend on the density
matrix $\rho$ through the quantity $\omega_q = Tr\rho^q$, and admit as a
particular instance the standard von Neumann entropy in the limit case $q\to
1$. A comprehensive numerical survey of the space of pure and mixed states of
bipartite systems is here performed, in order to determine the volumes in state
space occupied by those states exhibiting various special properties related to
the signs of their conditional $q$-entropies and to their connections with
other separability-related features, including the majorization condition.
Different values of the entropic parameter $q$ are considered, as well as
different values of the dimensions $N_1$ and $N_2$ of the Hilbert spaces
associated with the constituting subsystems. Special emphasis is paid to the
analysis of the monotonicity properties, both as a function of $q$ and as a
function of $N_1$ and $N_2$, of the various entropic functionals considered.

helps in fair and unbiased election of a leader in a distributed network of

total of $O(\log n)$ distinct multi-partite maximally entanglement sets (ebits)
are capable of supporting such a protocol in the presence of nodes that may lie
and thus be biased. Here, $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. We also
demonstrate the difficulty of performing unbiased and fair election of a leader
with linear classical communication complexity in the absence of quantum
entanglement even if all nodes have perfect random bit generators. We show that
the presence of a sufficient number $O(n/\log n)$ of biased agents leads to a
non-zero limiting probability of biased election of the leader, whereas, the
presence of a smaller number $O(\log n)$ of biased agents matters little. We
define two new related complexity classes motivated by the our leader election

electron counting statistics in a mesoscopic multiterminal conductor and we
discuss its properties. We first consider the idealized situation in which a
flux of entangled electrons is generated by an entangler. Given a certain
average number of incoming entangled electrons, the CH inequality can be
evaluated for different numbers of transmitted particles. Strong violations
occur when the number of transmitted charges on the two terminals is the same
($Q_1=Q_2$), whereas no violation is found for $Q_1\ne Q_2$. We then consider
two actual setups that can be realized experimentally. The first one consists
of a three terminal normal beam splitter and the second one of a hybrid
superconducting structure. Interestingly, we find that the CH inequality is
violated for the three terminal normal device. The maximum violation scales as
1/M and $1/M^2$ for the entangler and normal beam splitter, respectively, 2$M$
being the average number of injected electrons. As expected, we find full
violation of the CH inequality in the case of the superconducting system.

evolution of MQ coherences of systems of coupled nuclear spins in solids is
directly connected with dynamics of the quantum entanglement. We studied
analytically dynamics of entangled states for two- and three-spin systems
coupled by the dipole-dipole interaction. In this case dynamics of the quantum
entanglement is uniquely determined by the time evolution of MQ coherences of
the second order. The real part of the density matrix describing MQ dynamics in
solids is responsible for MQ coherences of the zeroth order while its imaginary
part is responsible for the second order. Thus, one can conclude that dynamics
of the entanglement is connected with transitions from the real part of the
density matrix to the imaginary one and vice versa. A pure state which
generalizes the GHZ and W states is found. Different measures of the
entanglement of this state are analyzed for three-partite systems.

is shown that spin squeezing of both the atoms and the field can be achieved
provided the initial state of the cavity field has coherence between number
states differing by 2. Most of the discussion is restricted to the case of a
cavity field initially in a coherent state, but initial squeezed states for the
field are also discussed. Optimal conditions for obtaining squeezing are
obtained. An analytic solution is found that is valid in the limit that the
number of atoms is much greater than unity and is also much larger than the
average number of photons, inititally in the coherent state of the cavity
field. In this limit, the degree of spin squeezing increases with increasing a,
even though the field more closely resembles a classical field for which no
spin squeezing could be achieved.

quantum fidelity is related to the period of the classical motion. This
indicates the possibility of recurrence in near integrable systems. We have
studied such possibility in detail with the kicked rotor as an example. In
accordance with the correspondence principle, recurrence is observed when the
underlying classical dynamics is well approximated by the harmonic oscillator.
Quantum revivals of fidelity is noted in the interior of resonances, while
classical-quantum correspondence of fidelity is seen to be very short for
states initially in the rotational KAM region.

unitary evolution is developed. We show that these phases arise from three
basic ideas: (1) fulfillment of quantum parallel transport of a complete basis,
(2) a concept of mixed state orthogonality adapted to unitary evolution, and
(3) a normalization condition. We provide a method for computing the
off-diagonal mixed state phases to any order for unitarities that divide the
parallel transported basis of Hilbert space into two parts: one part where each
basis vector undergoes cyclic evolution and one part where all basis vectors
are permuted among each other. We also demonstrate a purification based
experimental procedure for the two lowest order mixed state phases and consider
a physical scenario for a full characterization of the qubit mixed state
geometric phases in terms of polarization-entangled photon pairs. An
alternative second order off-diagonal mixed state geometric phase, which can be
tested in single-particle experiments, is proposed.

densities for a particle in an asymmetric infinite well. In an idealized system
with a discontinuous step in the middle of the well, the classical and quantum
probability distributions agree fairly well, even for relatively small quantum
numbers, except for anomalous cases which are due to the unphysical nature of
the potential. We are able to derive upper and lower bounds on the differences
between the quantum and classical results. We also qualitatively discuss the
momentum-space probability densities for this system using intuitive ideas
about how much time a classical particle spends in various parts of the well.
This system provides an excellent example of a non-trivial, but tractable,
quantum mechanical bound state problem where the correlations between the
amplitude and curvature of quantum mechanical wavefunctions can be easily
compared to classical intuition about particle motion, with quantitative
success, but also warning of possible surprises in non-physical limiting cases.

on the quantum computing model. Pure states are vectors of a suitable linear
space over the quaternions. Other aspects of the theory are the same as in
quantum computing: superposition and linearity of the state space, unitarity of
the transformations, and projective measurements. However, one notable
exception is the fact that quaternionic circuits do not have a uniquely defined
behaviour, unless a total ordering of evaluation of the gates is defined. Given
such an ordering a unique unitary operator can be associated with the
quaternionic circuit and a proper semantics of computation can be associated
with it.
  The main result of this paper consists in showing that this model is no more
powerful than quantum computing, as long as such an ordering of gates can be
defined. More concretely we show, that for all quaternionic computation using n
quaterbits, the behaviour of the circuit for each possible gate ordering can be
simulated with n+1 qubits, and this with little or no overhead in circuit size.
The proof of this result is inspired of a new simplified and improved proof of
the equivalence of a similar model based on real amplitudes to quantum
computing, which states that any quantum computation using n qubits can be
simulated with n+1 rebits, and in this with no circuit size overhead.
  Beyond this potential computational equivalence, however, we propose this
model as a simpler framework in which to discuss the possibility of a
quaternionic quantum mechanics or information theory. In particular, it already
allows us to illustrate that the introduction of quaternions might violate some
of the ``natural'' properties that we have come to expect from physical models.

used in all statistical theories of irreversible thermodynamics is shown to be

circular infinite well (billiard) system and find that there are approximate
revivals. For the special case of purely $m=0$ states (central wave packets
with no momentum) the revival time is $T_{rev}^{(m=0)} = 8\mu R^2/\hbar \pi$,
where $\mu$ is the mass of the particle, and the revivals are almost exact. For
all other wave packets, we find that $T_{rev}^{(m \neq 0)} = (\pi^2/2)
T_{rev}^{(m=0)} \approx 5T_{rev}^{(m=0)}$ and the nature of the revivals
becomes increasingly approximate as the average angular momentum or number of
$m \neq 0$ states is/are increased. The dependence of the revival structure on
the initial position, energy, and angular momentum of the wave packet and the
connection to the energy spectrum is discussed in detail. The results are also
compared to two other highly symmetrical 2D infinite well geometries with exact
revivals, namely the square and equilateral triangle billiards. We also show
explicitly how the classical periodicity for closed orbits in a circular
billiard arises from the energy eigenvalue spectrum, using a WKB analysis.

We do
this by showing how to tailor the resonant energy (Foerster-Dexter) transfer
mechanisms and the biexciton binding energy in a quantum dot molecule. We
calculate the magnitude of these two electrostatic interactions as a function
of dot size, interdot separation, material composition, confinement potential
and applied electric field by using an envelope function approximation in a
two-cuboid dot molecule. In the first implementation, we show that it is
desirable to suppress the Foerster coupling and to create entanglement by using
the biexciton energy alone. We show how to perform universal quantum logic in a
second implementation which uses the biexciton energy together with
appropriately tuned laser pulses: by selecting appropriate materials parameters
high fidelity logic can be achieved. The third implementation proposes
generating quantum entanglement by switching the Foerster interaction itself.
We show that the energy transfer can be fast enough in certain dot structures
that switching can occur on a timescale which is much less than the typical
decoherence times.

almost uniformly spread over the well. We focus on visualizing these phenomena
in both position- and momentum-space as well as by following the time-dependent
expectation values of and uncertainties in position and momentum. We discuss
the time scales for wave packet collapse, using both an autocorrelation
function analysis, as well as focusing on expectation values and find two
relevant time scales which describe different aspects of the decay phase. In an
Appendix, we briefly discuss wave packet revival and collapse in a more
general, one-dimensional power-law potential given by $V_{(k)}(x) = V_0|x/a|^k$
which interpolates between the case of the harmonic oscillator ($k=2$) and the
infinite well ($k=\infty$).

  Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM)</title><description>  In single spin Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy (MRFM), the objective is
to detect the presence of an electron (or nuclear) spin in a sample volume by
measuring spin-induced attonewton forces using a micromachined cantilever. In
the OSCAR method of single spin MRFM, the spins are manipulated by an external
rf field to produce small periodic deviations in the resonant frequency of the
cantilever. These deviations can be detected by frequency demodulation followed
by conventional amplitude or energy detection. In this paper, we present an
alternative to these detection methods, based on optimal detection theory and
Gibbs sampling. On the basis of simulations, we show that our detector
outperforms the conventional amplitude and energy detectors for realistic MRFM
operating conditions. For example, to achieve a 10% false alarm rate and an 80%
correct detection rate our detector has an 8 dB SNR advantage as compared with
the conventional amplitude or energy detectors. Furthermore, at these detection
rates it comes within 4 dB of the omniscient matched-filter lower bound.

during its time of foundation have remained with us to this day. These problems
are centered on the problematic relation between the quantum and classical
worlds. The most famous element is the measurement problem, i.e., the
measurement of a quantum system by a classical apparatus, and the concomitant
phenomena of wave packet reduction, the appearance of probability, and the
problems related to Schr\&quot;odinger cat states. A fundamental question in this
context is whether quantum mechanics can bootstrap itself to the classical
world: is quantum mechanics self-consistent, such that the measurement process
can be understood within quantum mechanics itself, or does this process require
additional elements from the realm outside of traditional quantum mechanics?
Here, we point to a problematic aspect in the traditional Schr\&quot;odinger cat
argument which can be overcome through its extension with a proper macroscopic
preparation device; the deliberate creation of a cat state and its
identification then turns into a non-trivial problem requiring the
determination of the evolution of a quantum system entangled with a macroscopic
reservoir. We describe a new type of wave-function correlator testing for the
appearance of Schr\&quot;odinger cat states and discuss its implications for
theories deriving the wave function collapse from a unitary evolution.

dissipative process of spontaneous emission. It is shown that spontaneous
emission can lead to a transient entanglement between the atoms even if the
atoms were prepared initially in an unentangled state. The amount of
entanglement created in the system is quantified by using two different
measures: concurrence and negativity. We find analytical formulas for the
evolution of concurrence and negativity in the system. We also find the
analytical relation between the two measures of entanglement. The system
consists of two two-level atoms which are separated by an arbitrary distance
$r_{12}$ and interact with each other via the dipole-dipole interaction, and
the antisymmetric state of the system is included throughout, even for small
inter-atomic separations, in contrast to the small sample model. It is shown
that for sufficiently large values of the dipole-dipole interaction initially
the entanglement exhibits oscillatory behaviour with considerable entanglement
in the peaks. For longer times the amount of entanglement is directly related
to the population of the slowly decaying antisymmetric state.

Ising-type models. We analyze in particular the time evolution of initial Bell
states created in a fully polarized background and on the ground state. We find
that the pairwise entanglement propagates with a velocity proportional to the
reduced interaction for all the four Bell states. Singlet-like states are
favored during the propagation, in the sense that triplet-like states change
their character during the propagation under certain circumstances.
Characteristic for the anisotropic models is the instantaneous creation of
pairwise entanglement from a fully polarized state; furthermore, the
propagation of pairwise entanglement is suppressed in favor of a creation of
different types of entanglement. The ``entanglement wave'' evolving from a Bell
state on the ground state turns out to be very localized in space-time. Further
support to a recently formulated conjecture on entanglement sharing is given.

  Measurements</title><description>  Heisenberg's uncertainty relation for measurement noise and disturbance
states that any position measurement with noise epsilon brings the momentum
disturbance not less than hbar/2epsilon. This relation holds only for
restricted class of measuring apparatuses. Here, Heisenberg's uncertainty
relation is generalized to a relation that holds for all the possible quantum
measurements, from which conditions are obtained for measuring apparatuses to
satisfy Heisenberg's relation. In particular, every apparatus with the noise
and the disturbance statistically independent from the measured object is
proven to satisfy Heisenberg's relation. For this purpose, all the possible
quantum measurements are characterized by naturally acceptable axioms. Then, a
mathematical notion of the distance between probability operator valued
measures and observables is introduced and the basic properties are explored.
Based on this notion, the measurement noise and disturbance are naturally
defined for any quantum measurements in a model independent formulation. Under
this formulation, various uncertainty relations are also derived for
apparatuses with independent noise, independent disturbance, unbiased noise,
and unbiased disturbance as well as noiseless apparatuses and nondisturbing
apparatuses. Two models of position measurements are discussed to show that
Heisenberg's relation can be violated even by approximately repeatable position
measurements.

decoherent and incoherent. Unitary errors are systematic, and result in a
density matrix that differs from the desired one by a unitary operation.
Decoherent errors correspond to general completely positive superoperators, and
can only be corrected using methods such as quantum error correction.
Incoherent errors can also be described, on average, by completely positive
superoperators, but can nevertheless be corrected by the application of a
locally unitary operation that ``refocuses'' them. They are due to reproducible
spatial or temporal variations in the system's Hamiltonian, so that information
on the variations is encoded in the system's spatiotemporal state and can be
used to correct them. In this paper liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) is used to demonstrate that such refocusing effects can be built directly
into the control fields, where the incoherence arises from spatial
inhomogeneities in the quantizing static magnetic field as well as the
radio-frequency control fields themselves. Using perturbation theory, it is
further shown that the eigenvalue spectrum of the completely positive
superoperator exhibits a characteristic spread that contains information on the
Hamiltonians' underlying distribution.

oracle calls (statistical queries), where the algorithm submits a query
function $g(cdot)$ and receives an approximation to $Pr_{x in S}[g(x)=1]$. We
show how this model is related to NMR quantum computing, in which only
statistical properties of an ensemble of quantum systems can be measured, and
in particular to the question of whether one can translate standard quantum
algorithms to the NMR setting without putting all of their classical
post-processing into the quantum system. Using Fourier analysis techniques
developed in the related context of {em statistical query learning}, we prove a
number of lower bounds (both information-theoretic and cryptographic) on the
ability of algorithms to produces an $xin S$, even when the set $S$ is fairly
simple. These lower bounds point out a difficulty in efficiently applying NMR
quantum computing to algorithms such as Shor's and Simon's algorithm that
involve significant classical post-processing. We also explicitly relate the

  Terms of the Group SO(1,2)</title><description>  The problem of quantizing the canonical pair angle and action variables phi
and I is almost as old as quantum mechanics itself and since decades a strongly
debated but still unresolved issue in quantum optics. The present paper
proposes a new approach to the problem, namely quantization in terms of the
group SO(1,2): The crucial point is that the phase space S^2 = {phi mod 2pi,
I&gt;0} has the global structure S^1 x R^+ (a simple cone) and cannot be quantized
in the conventional manner. As the group SO(1,2) acts appropriately on that
space its unitary representations of the positive discrete series provide the
correct quantum theoretical framework. The space S^2 has the conic structure of
an orbifold R^2/Z_2. That structure is closely related to the center Z_2 of the
symplectic group Sp(2,R). The basic variables on S^2 are the functions h_0 = I,
h_1 = I cosphi and h_2 = -I sinphi, the Poisson brackets of which obey the Lie
algebra so(1,2). In the quantum theory they are represented by self-adjoint
generators K_0, K_1 and K_2 of a unitary representation. A crucial prediction
is that the classical Pythagorean relation h_1^2+h_2^2 = h_0^2 may be violated
in the quantum theory. For each representation one can define 3 different types
of coherent states the complex phases of which can be &quot;measured&quot; by means of
K_1 and K_2 alone without introducing any new phase operators! The SO(1,2)
structure of optical squeezing and interference properties as well as that of
the harmonic oscillator are analyzed in detail. The new coherent states can be
used for the introduction of (Husimi type) Q and (Sudarshan-Glauber type) P
representations of the density operator. The 3 operators K_0, K_1 and K_2 are
fundamental in the sense that one can construct (composite) position and
momentum operators out of them!

  as a hidden-variable theory</title><description>  Do diffusive non-Markovian stochastic Schr\&quot;odinger equations (SSEs) for open
quantum systems have a physical interpretation? In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. A
66, 012108 (2002)] we investigated this question using the orthodox
interpretation of quantum mechanics. We found that the solution of a
non-Markovian SSE represents the state the system would be in at that time if a
measurement was performed on the environment at that time, and yielded a
particular result. However, the linking of solutions at different times to make
a trajectory is, we concluded, a fiction. In this paper we investigate this
question using the modal (hidden variable) interpretation of quantum mechanics.
We find that the noise function $z(t)$ appearing in the non-Markovian SSE can
be interpreted as a hidden variable for the environment. That is, some chosen
property (beable) of the environment has a definite value $z(t)$ even in the
absence of measurement on the environment. The non-Markovian SSE gives the
evolution of the state of the system ``conditioned'' on this environment hidden
variable. We present the theory for diffusive non-Markovian SSEs that have as
their Markovian limit SSEs corresponding to homodyne and heterodyne detection,
as well as one which has no Markovian limit.

  pendulum</title><description>  The rigid pendulum, both as a classical and as a quantum problem, is an
interesting system as it has the exactly soluble harmonic oscillator and the
rigid rotor systems as limiting cases in the low- and high-energy limits
respectively. The energy variation of the classical periodicity ($\tau$) is
also dramatic, having the special limiting case of $\tau \to \infty$ at the
'top' of the classical motion (i.e. the separatrix.) We study the
time-dependence of the quantum pendulum problem, focusing on the behavior of
both the (approximate) classical periodicity and especially the quantum revival
and superrevival times, as encoded in the energy eigenvalue spectrum of the
system. We provide approximate expressions for the energy eigenvalues in both
the small and large quantum number limits, up to 4th order in perturbation
theory, comparing these to existing handbook expansions for the characteristic
values of the related Mathieu equation, obtained by other methods. We then use
these approximations to probe the classical periodicity, as well as to extract
information on the quantum revival and superrevival times. We find that while
both the classical and quantum periodicities increase monotonically as one
approaches the 'top' in energy, from either above or below, the revival times
decrease from their low- and high-energy values until very near the separatrix
where they increase to a large, but finite value.

whether the rule can also be applied counterfactually to the case where no

system in an intense coherent field with frequency lower than the
vacuum-induced decay width. As this additional low-frequency field is assumed
to be intense, multiphoton processes may be induced, which can be seen as
alternative transition pathways in addition to the simple spontaneous decay.
The interplay of the various interfering transition pathways influences the
decay dynamics of the two-level system and may be used to slow down the
spontaneous decay considerably. We derive from first principles an expression
for the Hamiltonian including up to three-photon processes. This Hamiltonian is
then applied to a quantum mechanical simulation of the decay dynamics of the

interacting with a two-level atom, is simultaneously submitted to linear and

fields in the achievement of real mesoscopic states, is to produce
highly-squeezed field states and, consequently, to increase both: i) the
distance in phase space between the components of the prepared superpositions
and ii) the mean photon number of such superpositions. When submitting the
squeezed superposition states to the action of similarly squeezed reservoirs,
we demonstrate that under specific conditions the decoherence time of the
states becomes independent of both the distance in phase space between their

this remarkable result, together with a discussion on the experimental

this propagator in the semi-classical region, and for times less than the
Ehrenfest time, we express its effect on an initial Gaussian wave packet in
terms of quantities analogous to those used to describe the exponential
separation of trajectories in the classical version of this system. This result
relates the spread of the wave packet to the rate of separation of classical
trajectories, characterized by positive Lyapunov exponents. We consider
applications of these results, first to illustrate the behavior of the
wave-packet auto-correlation functions for wave packets on periodic orbits. The
auto-correlation function can be related to the fidelity, or Loschmidt echo,
for the special case that the perturbation is a small change in the mass of the
particle. An exact expression for the fidelity, appropriate for this
perturbation, leads to an analytical result valid over very long time
intervals, inversely proportional to the size of the mass perturbation. For
such perturbations, we then calculate the long-time echo for semi-classical
wave packets on periodic orbits. This paper also corrects an earlier
calculation for a quantum echo, included in a previous version of this paper.
We explain the reasons for this correction.

trade-off between these two resources in the appropriate setting. We discuss
this problem from first principles, including the various choices one may
follow in the definitions of the actual resources. Our main result is a general
method of remote state preparation for arbitrary states of many qubits, at a
cost of 1 bit of classical communication and 1 bit of entanglement per qubit
sent. In this &quot;universal&quot; formulation, these ebit and cbit requirements are
shown to be simultaneously optimal by exhibiting a dichotomy. Our protocol then
yields the exact trade-off curve for arbitrary ensembles of pure states and
pure entangled states (including the case of incomplete knowledge of the
ensemble probabilities), based on the recently established quantum-classical
trade-off for quantum data compression. The paper includes an extensive
discussion of our results, including the impact of the choice of model on the
resources, the topic of obliviousness, and an application to private quantum
channels and quantum data hiding.

mechanics to allow for dramatic increases in computational efficiency.
rf-SQUIDs show potential for quantum computing applications by forming the
qubit component of a quantum computer, through simply treating the direction of
current - clockwise or counterclockwise - as the value of the bit. rf-SQUIDs
present a major advantage over atomic-scale qubit systems - they are sensitive
to parameters that can be engineered. Flux qubits are linked through controlled
inductive coupling: the magnetic field of each junction affects the others. The
strength of this coupling can be 'tuned,' allowing for refined control over the
behaviour of the system. rf-SQUIDs can also be mass produced on-chip, making
large-scale production feasible.

is known to require 2 log d shared random key bits between the sender and
receiver. We show that if only near-perfect security is required, the size of
the key can be reduced by a factor of two. More specifically, we show that
there exists a set of roughly d log d unitary operators whose average effect on
every input pure state is almost perfectly randomizing, as compared to the d^2
operators required to randomize perfectly. Aside from the private quantum
channel, variations of this construction can be applied to many other tasks in
quantum information processing. We show, for instance, that it can be used to
construct LOCC data hiding schemes for bits and qubits that are much more
efficient than any others known, allowing roughly log d qubits to be hidden in
2 log d qubits. The method can also be used to exhibit the existence of quantum
states with locked classical correlations, an arbitrarily large amplification
of the correlation being accomplished by sending a negligibly small classical
key. Our construction also provides the basic building block for a method of
remotely preparing arbitrary d-dimensional pure quantum states using
approximately log d bits of communication and log d ebits of entanglement.

each defined by a single photon occupying two optical modes (dual-rail qubit),
were generated independently by the single photon source. Upon measurement of
two modes from different qubits and postselection, the state of the two
remaining modes was found to reproduce the state of the target qubit. In
particular, the coherence between the target qubit modes was transferred to the
output modes to a large extent. The observed fidelity is 80 %, a figure which
can be explained quantitatively by the residual distinguishability between
consecutive photons from the source. An improved version of this teleportation

field theory, we investigate the optical generation and quantitative
characterizations of quantum entanglement in an electron-hole system, in
presence of spin-orbit coupling, and especially make a theoretical analysis of
a recent experimental result. Basically, such entanglement should be considered
as between occupation numbers of single particle basis states, and is
essentially generated by coupling between different single particle basis
states in the second quantized Hamiltonian. Interaction with two resonant light
modes of different circular polarizations generically leads to a superposition
of ground state and two heavy-hole excitonic states. When and only when the
state is a superposition of only the two excitonic eigenstates, the
entanglement reduces to that between two distinguishable particles, each with
two degrees of freedom, namely, band index, as characterized by angular
momentum, and orbit, as characterized by position or momentum. The band-index
state, obtained by tracing over the orbital degree of freedom, is found to be a
pure state, hence the band-index and orbital degrees of freedom are separated
in this state. We propose some basic ideas on spatially separating the electron
and the hole, so that the entanglement of band-indices, or angular momenta, is
between spatially separated electron and hole.

For an infinitely thin plate taking RR and RL regions together, in odd spatial

perfect anti-correlation of an EPR pair of spins in the same direction, and
apparently decrease the degree of the violation of Bell's inequality. To
maintain the perfect EPR correlation and the maximal violation of Bell's
inequality, observers must measure the spins in appropriately chosen different
directions. Which directions are appropriate depends on the velocity of the
particles, the curvature of the spacetime, and the positions of the observers.
Near the event horizon of a black hole, the appropriate directions depend so
sensitively on the positions of the observers that even a very small
uncertainty in the identification of the observers' positions leads to a fatal
error in quantum communication, unless the observers fall into the black hole

is incompatible with local realistic theories of nature. Here we define the
strength of such nonlocality proofs in terms of the amount of evidence against
local realism provided by the corresponding experiments. This measure tells us
how many trials of the experiment we should perform in order to observe a
substantial violation of local realism. Statistical considerations show that
the amount of evidence should be measured by the Kullback-Leibler or relative
entropy divergence between the probability distributions over the measurement
outcomes that the respective theories predict. The statistical strength of a
nonlocality proof is thus determined by the experimental implementation of it
that maximizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence from experimental (quantum
mechanical) truth to the set of all possible local theories. An implementation
includes a specification with which probabilities the different measurement
settings are sampled, and hence the maximization is done over all such setting
distributions.
  We analyze two versions of Bell's nonlocality proof (his original proof and
an optimized version by Peres), and proofs by Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt,
Hardy, Mermin, and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger. We find that the GHZ proof is
at least four and a half times stronger than all other proofs, while of the
two-party proofs, the one of CHSH is the strongest.

through them the entanglement is transported across the channel. For a large

that, contrary to the property of achromaticity (independence of wavelength)

polarization optics can, under certain conditions, show sharp changes and
reversals as a function of wavelength, a phenomenon originating in the
occurrence of phase singularities, earlier observed in interference

algorithm is studied. This type of noise may result from tiny fluctuations and
drift in the parameters of the (quantum) components performing the computation.
The resulting operations are still unitary, but not precisely those assumed in
the design of the algorithm. Here we focus on the effect of such noise in the
Hadamard gate $W$, which is an essential component in each iteration of the
quantum search process. To this end $W$ is replaced by a noisy Hadamard gate
$U$. The parameters of $U$ at each iteration are taken from an arbitrary
probability distribution (e.g. Gaussian distribution) and are characterized by
their statistical moments around the parameters of $W$. For simplicity we
assume that the noise is unbiased and isotropic, namely all noise variables in
the parametrization we use have zero average and the same standard deviation
$\epsilon$. The noise terms at different calls to $U$ are assumed to be
uncorrelated. For a search space of size $N=2^n$ (where $n$ is the number of
qubits used to span this space) it is found that as long as $\epsilon &lt;
O(n^{-{1/2}} N^{-{1/4}})$, the algorithm maintains significant efficiency,
while above this noise level its operation is hampered completely. It is also
found that below this noise threshold, when the search fails, it is likely to
provide a state that differs from the marked state by only a few bits. This
feature can be used to search for the marked state by a classical
post-processing, even if the quantum search has failed, thus improving the
success rate of the search process.

  interactions</title><description>  What interactions are sufficient to simulate arbitrary quantum dynamics in a
composite quantum system? It has been shown that all two-body Hamiltonian
evolutions can be simulated using \emph{any} fixed two-body entangling
$n$-qubit Hamiltonian and fast local unitaries. By \emph{entangling} we mean
that every qubit is coupled to every other qubit, if not directly, then
indirectly via intermediate qubits. We extend this study to the case where
interactions may involve more than two qubits at a time. We find necessary and
sufficient conditions for an arbitrary $n$-qubit Hamiltonian to be
\emph{dynamically universal}, that is, able to simulate any other Hamiltonian
acting on $n$ qubits, possibly in an inefficient manner. We prove that an
entangling Hamiltonian is dynamically universal if and only if it contains at
least one coupling term involving an \emph{even} number of interacting qubits.
For \emph{odd} entangling Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians with couplings that
involve only an odd number of qubits, we prove that dynamic universality is
possible on an encoded set of $n-1$ logical qubits. We further prove that an
odd entangling Hamiltonian can simulate any other odd Hamiltonian and classify
the algebras that such Hamiltonians generate. Thus, our results show that up to
local unitary operations, there are only two fundamentally different types of
entangling Hamiltonian on $n$ qubits. We also demonstrate that, provided the
number of qubits directly coupled by the Hamiltonian is bounded above by a
constant, our techniques can be made efficient.

$\mathbb{C}^2$ with its standard orthonormal basis $\{|0 &gt;, |1&gt; \}$ and $\rho_1

projection of the wavefunction in the basis of the detector as predicted by
von-Neumann's postulate. Hence, it is a question of fundametal interest, how
the preferred basis onto which the state is projected is selected out of the
macroscopic Hilbert space of the system. Detector-dominated von-Neumann
measurements are also desirable for both quantum computation and verification
of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale. The connection of these questions
to the predictions of the spin-boson modelis outlined. I propose a measurement
strategy, which uses the entanglement of the qubit with a weakly damped
harmonic oscillator. It is shown, that the degree of entanglement controls the
degree of renormalization of the qubit and identify, that this is equivalent to
the degree to which the measurement is detector-dominated. This measurement
very rapidly decoheres the initial state, but the thermalization is slow. The
implementation in Josephson quantum bits is described and it is shown that this
strategy also has practical advantages for the experimental implementation.

systems by comparing global and marginal mixednesses quantified by different
entropic measures. For systems of two qubits we discriminate the class of
maximally entangled states with fixed marginal mixednesses, and determine an
analytical upper bound relating the entanglement of formation to the marginal
linear entropies. This result partially generalizes to mixed states the
quantification of entaglement with marginal mixednesses holding for pure

globally more mixed than product states when measured by the linear entropy.
Such states cannot be discriminated by the majorization criterion.

enlarged by adding only classical shares and players. In a twin-threshold

probability ratio of the two decay modes is studied with general symmetry
consideration of isospin, spin, and parity. We arrive at a result of the ratio
$\frac{\Gamma(\Theta^+\to nK^+)}{\Gamma(\Theta^+\to pK^0)}

  The proof relies on two novel ideas. First, we give a new characterization of

problem which arises commonly in the context of QMA: the prover might use
entanglement between different copies of the same state in order to cheat. The

severely restrict the prover's possibility to cheat. We hope that these ideas

selectively destroying quantum coherence, to an active role of amplifier
selectively proliferating information about the system. We show that only
preferred pointer states of the system can leave a redundant and therefore

confined in a magnetic trap. We consider an exactly soluble one-dimensional
model, with a spatially localized delta-type coupling between the atoms in the
trap and a continuum of free-particle external modes. Two important special
cases are considered for the confinement potential: the infinite box and the
harmonic oscillator. We establish that in both cases a bound state of the
coupled system appears for any value of the coupling constant, implying that
the trap population does not vanish in the infinite-time limit. For weak
coupling, the energy spectrum of the outgoing beam exhibits peaks corresponding
to the initially occupied energy levels in the trap; the height of these peaks
increases with the energy. As the coupling gets stronger, the energy spectrum
is displaced towards dressed energies of the fermions in the trap. The
corresponding dressed states result from the coupling between the unperturbed
fermionic states in the trap, mediated by the coupling between these states and
the continuum. In the strong-coupling limit, there is a reinforcement of the
lowest-energy dressed mode, which contributes to the energy spectrum of the
outgoing beam more strongly than the other modes. This effect is especially
pronounced for the one-dimensional box, which indicates that the efficiency of
the mode-reinforcement mechanism depends on the steepness of the confinement
potential. In this case, a quasi-monochromatic anti-bunched atomic beam is
obtained. Results for a bosonic sample are also shown for comparison.

quantum dynamics to perturbations in the Hamiltonian. For a certain regime of
the parameters, the LE decays exponentially with a rate given by the Lyapunov
exponent of the underlying classically chaotic system. We develop a
semiclassical theory, supported by numerical results in a Lorentz gas model,
which allows us to establish and characterize the universality of this Lyapunov
regime. In particular, the universality is evidenced by the semiclassical limit
of the Fermi wavelength going to zero, the behavior for times longer than
Ehrenfest time, the insensitivity with respect to the form of the perturbation
and the behavior of individual (non-averaged) initial conditions. Finally, by
elaborating a semiclassical approximation to the Wigner function, we are able
to distinguish between classical and quantum origin for the different terms of
the LE. This approach renders an understanding for the persistence of the
Lyapunov regime after the Ehrenfest time, as well as a reinterpretation of our
results in terms of the quantum--classical transition.

strong coupling in quantum mechanics. In order to put the theory in a proper
historical perspective, the approach devised in quantum field theory is rapidly
presented, showing how it implies a kind of duality in perturbation theory,
from the start. The approach of renormalization group in perturbation theory is
then presented. This method permits to resum secularities in perturbation
theory and makes fully algorithmical the resummation, transforming the
perturbation calculations in a step by step computational procedure. The
general theorem on which is founded a proper application of the strong coupling
expansion, based on a result in the quantum adiabatic theory, is then exposed.
This theorem gives the leading order of a strong coupling expansion. Then,
after the introduction of the principle of duality in perturbation theory that
puts in a proper context the quantum field theory method, the resulting theory
of the strong coupling expansion and the free picture are presented. An
algorithm for the computation of the perturbation series is finally given. This
approach has a lot of applications in fields as quantum optics, condensed
matter and so on, extending the original expectations of the quantum field
theory method. So, we give some examples of application for a class of
two-level systems that, in recent years, proved to be extremely important. One
of the most interesting concepts that can be obtained in this way is that of a
Quantum Amplifier (QAMP) that permits to obtain an amplification to the
classical level of the quantum fluctuations of the ground state of a single
radiation mode.

repulsive bosons attracted to a center for the case that all the interactions
are short-ranged. Such bosonic atoms could be created by optically trapping
ultracold particles of alkali vapors; we present the theory describing how
their properties depend on experimentally adjustable strength of ``nuclear''
attraction and interparticle repulsion. The binding ability of the short-range
potential increases with space dimensionality - only a limited number of
particles can be bound in one dimension, while in two and three dimensions the
number of bound bosons can be chosen at will. Particularly in three dimensions
we find an unusual effect of enhanced resonant binding: for not very strong
interparticle repulsion the equilibrium number of bosons bound to a nuclear
potential having a sufficiently shallow single-particle state increases without
bound as the nuclear potential becomes less attractive. As a consequence of the
competing nuclear attraction enhanced by the Bose statistics and interparticle
repulsions, the dependence of the ground-state energy of the atom on the number
of particles has a minimum whose position is experimentally tunable. This
implies a staircase dependence of the equilibrium number of bound bosons on
external parameters which may be used to create a single-atom pipette - an
arrangement which allows the transport of atoms into and out of a reservoir,
one at a time.

Using numerical simulations and a general theory of the stabilities of
many-body quantum states, we show the following: Anomalously fluctuating states
(AFSs), which have anomalously large fluctuations of additive operators, appear
in various stages of the computation. For large L, they decohere at anomalously
great rates by weak noises that simulate noises in real systems. Decoherence of
some of the AFSs is fatal to the results of the computation, whereas
decoherence of some of the other AFSs does not have strong influence on the
results of the computation. When such a crucial AFS decoheres, the probability
of getting the correct computational result is reduced approximately
proportional to L^2. The reduction thus becomes anomalously large with
increasing L, even when the coupling constant to the noise is rather small.
Therefore, quantum computations should be improved in such a way that all AFSs
appearing in the algorithms do not decohere at such great rates in the existing
noises.

of a wave-chaotic system, where the lack of symmetry in the resonator shape
leads to non-integrable ray dynamics. Modes of such resonators display a rich
spatial structure, and cannot be classified through mode indices which would
require additional constants of motion in the ray dynamics. Understanding and
controlling the emission properties of such resonators requires the
investigation of the correspondence between classical phase space structures of
the ray motion inside the resonator and resonant solutions of the wave
equations. We first discuss the breakdown of the conventional eikonal
approximation in the short wavelength limit, and motivate the use of
phase-space ray tracing and phase space distributions. Next, we introduce an
efficient numerical method to calculate the quasi-bound modes of dielectric
resonators, which requires only two diagonalizations per N states, where N is
approximately equal to the number of half-wavelengths along the perimeter. The
relationship between classical phase space structures and modes is displayed
via the Husimi projection technique. Observables related to the emission
pattern of the resonator are calculated with high efficiency.

real parameterization obtained by the juxtaposition of the affine Bloch vectors
of each qubit. While it maintains the tensorial structure of the underlying
space, it highlights the pattern of correlations, both classical and quantum,
between the subsystems and, due to the affine parameterization, it contains in
its components all reduced densities of all orders. The main purpose of our use
of this formalism is to deal with entanglement. For example, the detection of
bipartite entanglement is straightforward, as it is the synthesis of densities
having positive partial transposes between desired qubits. In addition, finding
explicit mixtures for families of separable states becomes a feasible issue for
few qubit symmetric densities (we compute it for Werner states) and, more
important, it provides some insight on the possible origin of entanglement for
such densities.

The problem is to determine whether a common eigenspace specified by equalities

cases: (i) all operators H_a are k-local; (ii) all operators H_a are
factorized. It can be easily shown that both problems belong to the class QMA -
the quantum analogue of NP, and that some NP-complete problems can be reduced
to either (i) or (ii). A non-trivial question is whether the problems (i) or
(ii) belong to NP? We show that the answer is positive for some special values
of k and d. Also we prove that the problem (ii) can be reduced to its special
case, such that all operators H_a are factorized projectors and all h_a=0.

time-dependent quantum-beat effect is predicted if the interfering photons have
different frequencies. The calculation also reveals that full two-photon fringe
visibility can be achieved under almost any circumstances by applying a

  Distribution</title><description>  After Mayers (1996, 2001) gave a proof of the security of the
Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) quantum key distribution protocol, Shor and
Preskill (2000) made a remarkable observation that a Calderbank-Shor-Steane
(CSS) code had been implicitly used in the BB84 protocol, and suggested its
security could be proven by bounding the fidelity, say F(n), of the
incorporated CSS code of length n in the form 1-F(n) &lt;= exp[-n E+o(n)] for some
positive number E. This work presents such a number E=E(R) as a function of the
rate of a code R, and a threshold R' such that E(R)&gt;0 whenever R &lt; R', which is
larger than the achievable rate based on the Gilbert-Varshamov bound that is
essentially due to Shor and Preskill (2000). The codes in the present work are
robust against fluctuations of channel parameters, which fact is needed to
establish the security rigorously and was not proved for rates above the
Gilbert-Varshamov rate before in the literature. As a byproduct, the security
of a modified BB84 protocol against any joint (coherent) attacks is proved
quantitatively.

existence of extensions of a bipartite quantum state $\rho$ to a larger number
of parties satisfying certain symmetry properties. It can be easily shown that
all separable states have the required extensions, so the non-existence of such
an extension for a particular state implies that the state is entangled. One of
the main advantages of this approach is that searching for the extension can be
cast as a convex optimization problem known as a semidefinite program (SDP).
Whenever an extension does not exist, the dual optimization constructs an
explicit entanglement witness for the particular state. These separability
tests can be ordered in a hierarchical structure whose first step corresponds
to the well-known Positive Partial Transpose (Peres-Horodecki) criterion, and
each test in the hierarchy is at least as powerful as the preceding one. This
hierarchy is complete, in the sense that any entangled state is guaranteed to
fail a test at some finite point in the hierarchy, thus showing it is
entangled. The entanglement witnesses corresponding to each step of the
hierarchy have well-defined and very interesting algebraic properties that in
turn allow for a characterization of the interior of the set of positive maps.
Coupled with some recent results on the computational complexity of the
separability problem, which has been shown to be NP-hard, this hierarchy of
tests gives a complete and also computationally and theoretically appealing
characterization of mixed bipartite entangled states.

  control</title><description>  With the growing efforts in isolating solid-state qubits from external
decoherence sources, the origins of noise inherent to the material start to
play a relevant role. One representative example are charged impurities in the
device material or substrate, which typically produce telegraph noise and can
hence be modelled as bistable fluctuators. In order to demonstrate the
possibility of the active suppression of the disturbance from a {\em single}
fluctuator, we theoretically implement an elementary bang-bang control
protocol. We numerically simulate the random walk of the qubit state on the
Bloch sphere with and without bang-bang compensation by means of the stochastic
Schr\&quot;odinger equation and compare it with an analytical saddle point solution
of the corresponding Langevin equation in the long-time limit. We find that the
deviation with respect to the noiseless case is significantly reduced when
bang-bang pulses are applied, being scaled down approximately by the ratio of
the bang-bang period and the typical flipping time of the bistable fluctuation.
Our analysis gives not only the effect of bang-bang control on the variance of
these deviations, but also their entire distribution. As a result, we expect
that bang-bang control works as a high-pass filter on the spectrum of noise
sources. This indicates how the influence of $1/f$-noise ubiquitous to the
solid state world can be reduced.

what emerges from Schr\&quot;odinger's equation for a system of particles when we
merely insist that ``particles'' means particles. While distinctly
non-Newtonian, Bohmian mechanics is a fully deterministic theory of particles
in motion, a motion choreographed by the wave function. We find that a Bohmian
universe, though deterministic, evolves in such a manner that an {\it
appearance} of randomness emerges, precisely as described by the quantum
formalism and given, for example, by ``$\rho=|\psis|^2$.'' A crucial ingredient
in our analysis of the origin of this randomness is the notion of the effective
wave function of a subsystem, a notion of interest in its own right and of
relevance to any discussion of quantum theory. When the quantum formalism is
regarded as arising in this way, the paradoxes and perplexities so often
associated with (nonrelativistic) quantum theory simply evaporate.

formulae, written in terms of matrix coefficients, characterizing operators
implementable with exactly zero, one, or two controlled-not (CNOT) gates and
all other gates being one-qubit. We give an algorithm for synthesizing
two-qubit circuits with optimal number of CNOT gates, and illustrate it on

which define the dynamics of the system. In this case decoherence, and
complementary noise, is manifest when data from repeated measurement trials are
combined. Recently a number of authors have suggested that fluctuations in the
space-time metric arising from quantum gravity effects would correspond to a
source of intrinsic noise, which would necessarily be accompanied by intrinsic
decoherence. This work extends a previous heuristic modification of
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger dynamics based on discrete time intervals with an intrinsic
uncertainty. The extension uses unital semigroup representations of space and
time translations rather than the more usual unitary representation, and does
the least violence to physically important invariance principles. Physical
consequences include a modification of the uncertainty principle and a
modification of field dispersion relations, in a way consistent with other
modifications suggested by quantum gravity and string theory .

low pulse height dispersion. These properties make it ideal for efficient
photon number state detection. The ability to perform efficient photon number
state detection is important in many quantum information processing
applications, including recent proposals for performing quantum computation
with linear optical elements. In this paper we investigate the unique
capabilities of the VLPC. The efficiency of the detector and cryogenic system
is measured at 543nm wavelengths to be 85%. A picosecond pulsed laser is then
used to excite the detector with pulses having average photon numbers ranging
from 3-5. The output of the VLPC is used to discriminate photon numbers in a
pulse. The error probability for number state discrimination is an increasing
function of the number of photons, due to buildup of multiplication noise. This
puts an ultimate limit on the ability of the VLPC to do number state detection.
For many applications, it is sufficient to discriminate between 1 and more than
one detected photon. The VLPC can do this with 99% accuracy.

refinement of the local inertial structure of the world, demanding a
replacement of the usual Minkowski line element by a 4+2n dimensional
pseudo-Euclidean line element, with the extra 2n being the number of internal
phase space dimensions of the observed system. In the refined structure, the
inverse of the Planck time takes over the role of observer-independent
conversion factor usually played by the speed of light, which now emerges as an
invariant but derivative quantity. In the relativistic theory based on the
refined structure, energies and momenta turn out to be invariantly bounded from
above, and lengths and durations similarly bounded from below, by their
respective Planck scale values. Along the external timelike world-lines, the
theory naturally captures the `flow of time' as a genuinely structural
attribute of the world. The theory also predicts expected
deviations--suppressed quadratically by the Planck energy--from the dispersion
relations for free fields in the vacuum. The deviations from the special
relativistic Doppler shifts predicted by the theory are also suppressed
quadratically by the Planck energy. Nonetheless, in order to estimate the
precision required to distinguish the theory from special relativity, an
experiment with a binary pulsar emitting TeV range gamma-rays is considered in
the context of the predicted deviations from the second-order shifts.

$\zeta \to \infty$ when the parity of either component averages to zero. For a
given entangled {\it two spin} system BIQV is optimized via orientations of the
operators entering the Bell operator (cf. S. L. Braunstein, A. Mann and M.
Revzen: Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf68}, 3259 (1992)). We show that for finite $\zeta$
in continuous variable systems (and in general whenever the dimensionality of
the subsystems is greater than 2) additional parameters are present for
optimizing BIQV. Thus the expectation value of the Bell operator depends, in
addition to the orientation parameters, on configuration parameters.
Optimization of these configurational parameters leads to a unique maximal BIQV
that depends only on $\zeta.$ The configurational parameter variation is used
to show that BIQV relation to entanglement is, even for pure state, not
monotonic.

$G$-circulant and as a bunkbed $G \rtimes \Int_{2}$, where $G$ is a finite
group. Analyses of these classes suggest that the $n$-cube might be special in
having instantaneous uniform mixing and that non-uniform average mixing is
pervasive, i.e., no memoryless property for the average limiting distribution;
an implication of these graphs having zero spectral gap. But on the bunkbeds,
we note a memoryless property with respect to the two partitions. We also
analyze average mixing on complete paths, where the spectral gaps are nonzero.

We show that conditional probability in his model cannot be defined by

of the most challenging goals of modern experimental quantum mechanics,
touching fundamental questions as well as practical applications. Here we
report on the experimental realization of controlled collisions between
individual neighbouring neutral atoms trapped in the periodic potential of an
optical lattice. These controlled interactions act as an array of quantum gates
between neighbouring atoms in the lattice and their massively parallel
operation allows the creation of highly entangled states in a single
operational step, independent of the size of the system. In the experiment, we
observe a coherent entangling-disentangling evolution in the many-body system
depending on the phase shift acquired during the collision between neighbouring

transformations depend on a tunable free parameter, the homodyne local
oscillator angle; for n-mode systems they depend on n heterodyne mixing angles.
The canonical formalism realizes nontrivial mixings of pairs of conjugate
quadratures of the electromagnetic field in terms of homodyne variables for
single-mode systems; and in terms of heterodyne variables for multimode
systems. In the first instance the transformations yield nonquadratic model
Hamiltonians of degenerate multiphoton processes and define a class of non
Gaussian, nonclassical multiphoton states that exhibit properties of coherence
and squeezing. We show that such homodyne multiphoton squeezed states are
generated by unitary operators with a nonlinear time evolution that realizes
the homodyne mixing of a pair of conjugate quadratures. Tuning of the local
oscillator angle allows to vary at will the statistical properties of such
states. We discuss the relevance of the formalism for the study of degenerate

Integral conservation laws are investigated. The corresponding conserved

the quantum (ground state) entropy does not directly enter into the canonical

embedded in a photonic bandgap crystal and resonantly driven by a classical
pump light are calculated. The non-Markovian nature of the problem caused by
the non-uniform distribution of the photonic density of states is handled by
linearizing the generalized optical Bloch equations with the Liouville operator
expansion. Unlike the case in free space, we find that the bandgap effects will
not only modify the fluorescence spectral shape but also cause squeezing in the
in-phase quadrature spectra.

materials with arbitrarily shaped surfaces is developed. The interaction is
generated by the quantum and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field
which depend on the dielectric function of the materials. Using a path integral
approach for the electromagnetic gauge field, we derive an effective Gaussian
action which can be used to compute the force between the objects. No
assumptions about the independence of the shape and material dependent
contributions to the interaction are made. In the limiting case of flat
surfaces our approach yields a simple and compact derivation of the Lifshitz
theory for molecular forces. For ideal metals with arbitrarily deformed
surfaces the effective action can be calculated explicitly. For the general
case of deformed dielectric materials the applicability of perturbation theory
and numerical techniques to the evaluation of the force from the effective
action is discussed.

classical electrical field is calculated theoretically for the first time as we
know. The non-Markovian noises caused by the non-uniform distribution of photon
density of states near the photonic bandgap are handled by a new approach in
which the Liouville operator expansion is utilized to linearize the generalized
optical Bloch equations. The fluorescence spectra are then directly solved by
the linearized Bloch equations in the frequency domain. We find that if the
atomic energy level is far from the bandgap, fluorescence spectra with Mollow's
triplets are observed. However, when the atomic energy level is near the
bandgap, the relative magnitude and the number of the fluorescence peaks are
found to be varied according to the wavelength offset.

universal multimeters for a special choice of program. In both cases we start
with deterministic but erroneous devices and then proceed to devices that never
make a mistake but from time to time they give an inconclusive result. These
multimeters are optimized (for a given type of a program) with respect to the

to the multimeters that minimize the error rate for a given probability of an

(Bell-KS) theorem. It is true that they invalidate KS's account of the
theorem's physical implications. However, they do not invalidate Bell's point,
that quantum mechanics is inconsistent with the classical assumption, that a
measurement tells us about a property previously possessed by the system. This
failure of classical ideas about measurement is, perhaps, the single most
important implication of quantum mechanics. In a conventional colouring there
are some remaining patches of white. MKC fill in these patches, but only at the
price of introducing patches where the colouring becomes ''pathologically''
discontinuous. The discontinuities mean that the colours in these patches are
empirically unknowable. We prove a general theorem which shows that their
extent is at least as great as the patches of white in a conventional approach.
The theorem applies, not only to the MKC colourings, but also to any other such
attempt to circumvent the Bell-KS theorem (Pitowsky's colourings, for example).
We go on to discuss the implications. MKC do not nullify the Bell-KS theorem.
They do, however, show that we did not, hitherto, properly understand the

applications in linear optics quantum computation, provided that stringent

photons are met. We show that these are conflicting requirements for anharmonic
emitters that are incoherently pumped via reservoirs. As a model for a
coherently pumped single photon source, we consider cavity-assisted spin-flip
Raman transitions in a single charged quantum dot embedded in a microcavity. We
demonstrate that using such a source, arbitrarily high collection efficiency

simultaneously with increased cavity coupling. We analyze the role of errors
that arise from distinguishability of the single photon pulses in linear optics
quantum gates by relating the gate fidelity to the strength of the two-photon
interference dip in photon cross-correlation measurements. We find that
performing controlled phase operations with error &lt; 1% requires nano-cavities

path-centroid method in the configuration-space path integral. Paths can be
classified by the mid-point of their ends; short paths where the mid-point is
close to (q,p) and which lie in regions of low energy (low P function of the
Hamiltonian) will dominate, and the enclosed area will determine the sign of
the Wigner function. As a demonstration, the method is applied to a sequence of
density matrices interpolating between a Poissonian number distribution and a

path integral with a finite number of vertices. Saddle point evaluation of
these integrals recovers (up to a constant factor) the WKB approximation to the

muonic hydrogen. Using recent theoretical results on the proton polarizability

a problem to compute a solution. On a quantum computer there are different
realizations of a query and we will show that these are not always equivalent.
Our definition of equivalence is based on the ability to simulate (or
approximate) one query type by another. We show that a bit query can always
approximate a phase query with just two queries, while there exist problems for
which the number of phase queries which are necessary to approximate a bit
query must grow exponentially with the precision of the bit query. This result
follows from the query complexity bounds for the evaluation problem, for which
we establish a strong lower bound for the number of phase queries by exploiting
a relation between quantum algorithms and trigonometric polynomials.

square of the inner product equals 1/d: |&lt;v,w&gt;| ^{2}=1/d. The MUB problem is to
prove or disprove the the existence of a maximal set of d+1 bases. It has been
shown in [W. K. Wootters, B. D. Fields, Annals of Physics, 191, no. 2, 363-381,

a trade-off arises between the three resources, some portions of which have

  extended medium under the regime of strong field-matter coupling</title><description>  Nonstationary pump-probe interaction between short laser pulses propagating
in a resonant optically dense coherent medium is considered. A special
attention is paid to the case, where the density of two-level particles is high
enough that a considerable part of the energy of relatively weak external
laser-fields can be coherently absorbed and reemitted by the medium. Thus, the
field of medium reaction plays a key role in the interaction processes, which
leads to the collective behavior of an atomic ensemble in the strongly coupled
light-matter system. Such behavior results in the fast excitation interchanges
between the field and a medium in the form of the optical ringing, which is
analogous to polariton beating in the solid-state optics. This collective
oscillating response, which can be treated as successive beats between light
wave-packets of different group velocities, is shown to significantly affect
propagation and amplification of the probe field under its nonlinear
interaction with a nearly copropagating pump pulse. Depending on the probe-pump
time delay, the probe transmission spectra show the appearance of either
specific doublet or coherent dip. The widths of these features are determined
by the density-dependent field-matter coupling coefficient and increase during
the propagation. Besides that, the widths of the coherent features, which
appear close to the resonance in the broadband probe-spectrum, exceed the
absorption-line width, since, under the strong-coupling regime, the frequency
of the optical ringing exceeds the rate of incoherent relaxation. Contrary to
the stationary strong-field effects, the density- and coordinate-dependent
transmission spectra of the probe manifest the importance of the collective
oscillations and cannot be obtained in the framework of the single-atom model.

related to the Holevo capacity and the entanglement of formation [15]. In our
previous note [6] equivalence of these to the additivity of the Holevo capacity
for channels with arbitrary linear constraints was shown. This note is the
development of the previous one in the direction of channels with general
constraints. Introducing input constraints provides greater flexibility in the
treatment of the additivity conjecture. The Holevo capacity of arbitrarily
constrained channel is considered and the characteristic property of an optimal
ensemble for such channel is derived, generalizing the maximal distance
property of Schumacher and Westmoreland (proposition 1). It is shown that the
additivity conjecture for two channels with single linear constraints is
equivalent to the similar conjecture for two arbitrarily constrained channels
and, hence, to an interesting subadditivity property of the $\chi$-function for
the tensor product of these channels (theorem 1). We also propose an
alternative way of proving that the additivity conjecture for any two
unconstrained channels implies strong superadditivity of the entanglement of
formation. The arguments from the convex analysis provide another
characterization of channels for which subadditivity of the $\chi $-function
holds (theorem 3). This characterization and some modification of Shor's
channel extension provide a simple way of proving that global additivity of the
minimum output entropy for unconstrained channels implies global subadditivity
of the $\chi $-function and strong superadditivity of the entanglement of
formation.

driven at two-photon resonance by a pair of lasers, which cool the
center--of--mass motion. For this configuration, photons are scattered only due
to the mechanical effects of the quantum interaction between light and atom. We
study the spectrum of emission in the final stage of laser--cooling, when the
atomic center-of-mass dynamics is quantum mechanical and the size of the wave
packet is much smaller than the laser wavelength (Lamb--Dicke limit). We use
the spectral decomposition of the Liouville operator of the master equation for
the atomic density matrix and apply second order perturbation theory. We find
that the spectrum of resonance fluorescence is composed by two narrow sidebands
-- the Stokes and anti-Stokes components of the scattered light -- while all
other signals are in general orders of magnitude smaller. For very low
temperatures, however, the Mollow--type inelastic component of the spectrum
becomes visible. This exhibits novel features which allow further insight into
the quantum dynamics of the system. We provide a physical model that interprets
our results and discuss how one can recover temperature and cooling rate of the

circuit into tailored two- and three-qubit gates and we find their physical

  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Pair Block</title><description>  A protocol for quantum secure direct communication using blocks of EPR pairs
is proposed. A set of ordered $N$ EPR pairs is used as a data block for sending
secret message directly. The ordered $N$ EPR set is divided into two particle
sequences, a checking sequence and a message-coding sequence. After
transmitting the checking sequence, the two parties of communication check
eavesdropping by measuring a fraction of particles randomly chosen, with random
choice of two sets of measuring bases. After insuring the security of the
quantum channel, the sender, Alice encodes the secret message directly on the
message-coding sequence and send them to Bob. By combining the checking and
message-coding sequences together, Bob is able to read out the encoded messages
directly. The scheme is secure because an eavesdropper cannot get both
sequences simultaneously. We also discuss issues in a noisy channel.

universal quantum computation over a subspace. For example, by encoding logical
qubits into arrays of multiple physical qubits, a single isotropic or
anisotropic exchange interaction can generate a universal logical gate-set.
Recently, encoded universality for the exchange interaction was explicitly
demonstrated on three-qubit arrays, the smallest nontrivial encoding. We now
present the exact specification of a discrete universal logical gate-set on
four-qubit arrays. We show how to implement the single qubit operations exactly
with at most 3 nearest neighbor exchange operations and how to generate the
encoded controlled-not with 29 parallel nearest neighbor exchange interactions
or 54 serial gates, obtained from extensive numerical optimization using

described by a unitary transformation generated by a time dependent
Hamiltonian. The inverse problem of finding the field that generates a specific
unitary transformation is the subject of study. The unitary transformation
which can represent an algorithm in a quantum computation is imposed on a
subset of quantum states embedded in a larger Hilbert space. Optimal control
theory (OCT) is used to solve the inversion problem irrespective of the initial
input state. A unified formalism, based on the Krotov method is developed
leading to a new scheme. The schemes are compared for the inversion of a
two-qubit Fourier transform using as registers the vibrational levels of the
$X^1\Sigma^+_g$ electronic state of Na$_2$. Raman-like transitions through the
$A^1\Sigma^+_u$ electronic state induce the transitions. Light fields are found
that are able to implement the Fourier transform within a picosecond time
scale. Such fields can be obtained by pulse-shaping techniques of a femtosecond
pulse. Out of the schemes studied the square modulus scheme converges fastest.
A study of the implementation of the $Q$ qubit Fourier transform in the Na$_2$
molecule was carried out for up to 5 qubits. The classical computation effort
required to obtain the algorithm with a given fidelity is estimated to scale
exponentially with the number of levels. The observed moderate scaling of the
pulse intensity with the number of qubits in the transformation is
rationalized.

criticisms of the MCK papers. We thus elaborate in a little more detail how the
CK models can reproduce the predictions of quantum mechanics to arbitrary

finite precision measurement and contextuality, and defend the claims that the
CK models are both essentially classical and non-contextual. We also examine in
more detail the senses in which a theory can be said to be contextual or
non-contextual, and in which an experiment can be said to provide evidence on
the point. In particular, we criticise the suggestion that a decisive
experimental verification of contextuality is possible, arguing that the idea

enhancement is possible only if quantum correlations survive the cloning
process. We investigate preservation of the quantum correlations in the process
of non--local cloning of entangled pairs of two--level systems. We consider
different kinds of quantum cloning machines and compare their effectiveness in
the cloning of non--maximally entangled pure states. A mean entanglement is
introduced in order to obtain a quantitative evaluation of an average
efficiency for the different cloning machines. We show that a reduction of the
quantum correlations is significant and it strongly depends upon the kind of
cloning machine used. Losses of the entanglement are largest in the case of the
universal quantum cloning machine. Generally, in all cases considered the
losses of the entanglement are so drastic that the method of enhancement for
the performance of the quantum computation using the quantum cloning seems to
be questionable.

averaging, from a distribution mu of its wave function, a normalized vector
belonging to its Hilbert space H. While rho itself does not determine a unique
mu, additional facts, such as that the system has come to thermal equilibrium,
might. It is thus not unreasonable to ask, which mu, if any, corresponds to a
given thermodynamic ensemble? To answer this question we construct, for any
given density matrix rho, a natural measure on the unit sphere in H, denoted
GAP(rho). We do this using a suitable projection of the Gaussian measure on H
with covariance rho. We establish some nice properties of GAP(rho) and show
that this measure arises naturally when considering macroscopic systems. In
particular, we argue that it is the most appropriate choice for systems in
thermal equilibrium, described by the canonical ensemble density matrix
rho_beta = (1/Z) exp(- beta H). GAP(rho) may also be relevant to quantum chaos
and to the stochastic evolution of open quantum systems, where distributions on
H are often used.

  Bosonic Systems</title><description>  Quantum Field Theory (QFT) makes predictions by combining assumptions about
(1) quantum dynamics, typically a Schrodinger or Liouville equation; (2)
quantum measurement, usually via a collapse formalism. Here I define a
&quot;classical density matrix&quot; rho to describe ensembles of states of ordinary
second-order classical systems (ODE or PDE). I prove that the dynamics of the
field observables, phi and pi, defined as operators over rho, obey precisely
the usual Louiville equation for the same field operators in QFT, following
Weinberg's treatment. I discuss implications in detail - particularly the
implication that the difference between quantum computing and quantum mechanics
versus classical systems lies mainly on the measurement side, not the dynamic
side. But what if measurement itself were to be derived from dynamics and
boundary conditions? An heretical realistic approach to building finite field
theory is proposed, linked to the backwards time interpretation of quantum
mechanics.

  Generalized superselection rules</title><description>  Entanglement is a resource central to quantum information (QI). In
particular, entanglement shared between two distant parties allows them to do
certain tasks that would otherwise be impossible. In this context, we study the
effect on the available entanglement of physical restrictions on the local
operations that can be performed by the two parties. We enforce these physical
restrictions by generalized superselection rules (SSRs), which we define to be
associated with a given group of physical transformations. Specifically the
generalized SSR is that the local operations must be covariant with respect to
that group. Then we operationally define the entanglement constrained by a SSR,
and show that it may be far below that expected on the basis of a naive (or
``fluffy bunny'') calculation. We consider two examples. The first is a
particle number SSR. Using this we show that for a two-mode BEC (with Alice
owning mode $A$ and Bob mode $B$), the useful entanglement shared by Alice and
Bob is identically zero. The second, a SSR associated with the symmetric group,
is applicable to ensemble QI processing such as in liquid-NMR. We prove that
even for an ensemble comprising many pairs of qubits, with each pair described
by a pure Bell state, the entanglement per pair constrained by this SSR goes to
zero for a large ensemble.

can contain or not, and to what extent, the readings of rulers and clocks. The
paper first shows explicitly that, along with the momentum representation,
there is room in the one photon Hilbert space for an alternative position
representation. This is made possible by the existence of a self-adjoint,
involutive, position operator conjugate to the momentum operator (due to M.
Hawton). Position and momenta are shown to satisfy the Heisenberg-Weyl
quantization rules in the helicity basis, which is analyzed anew from this
point of view. The paper then turns to the photon's time of arrival. By picking
an appropriate photon Hamiltonian - using Maxwell equations as the photon
Schroedinger equation - a conjugate time of arrival operator is built. Its
interpretation, including the probability densities for the instant of arrival
(at arbitrary points of 3-D space) of photon states with different helicities
coming from arbitrary places, is discussed.

However, by using a novel data structure called the Quantum Information
Decision Diagram (QuIDD) that exploits the structure of quantum operators, a
useful subset of operator matrices and state vectors can be represented in a
form that grows polynomially with the number of qubits. This subset contains,
but is not limited to, any equal superposition of n qubits, any computational
basis state, n-qubit Pauli matrices, and n-qubit Hadamard matrices. It does
not, however, contain the discrete Fourier transform (employed in Shor's
algorithm) and some oracles used in Grover's algorithm. We first introduce and
motivate decision diagrams and QuIDDs. We then analyze the runtime and memory
complexity of QuIDD operations. Finally, we empirically validate QuIDD-based
simulation by means of a general-purpose quantum computing simulator QuIDDPro
implemented in C++. We simulate various instances of Grover's algorithm with
QuIDDPro, and the results demonstrate that QuIDDs asymptotically outperform all
other known simulation techniques. Our simulations also show that well-known
worst-case instances of classical searching can be circumvented in many

in a thermal, gibbsian state. Conditions are such that the act of measurement
drives the magnet in the up or down ferromagnetic state, according to the sign
of s_z of the test spin.
  The quantum measurement goes in two steps. On a timescale 1/\sqrt{N} the
collapse takes place due to a unitary evolution of test spin and apparatus
spins; on a larger but still short timescale this collapse is made definite by
the bath. Then the system is in a `classical' state, having a diagonal density
matrix. The registration of that state is basically a classical process, that
can already be understood from classical statistical mechanics.

induce transitions among the magnetic sublevels of the states. In particular,
we discuss the possibility of creating coherent superposition states in a

overlapping laser pulses it is possible to create any final superposition state
of the magnetic sublevels $|2,-2&gt;$, $|2,0&gt;$, $|2,+2&gt;$. Moreover, we find that
the relative phases of the applied pulses influence not only the phases of the

if we fix the shape and the time-delay between the pulses, the final state
space can be entirely covered by varying the polarizations and relative phases
of the two pulses. Performing numerical simulations we find that our transfer

wall. Despite its circular symmetry, this system is nonintegrable and almost
chaotic because of the (short-range) interaction between the disks. We quantize
the system by incorporating the excluded volume effect for the wavefunction.
Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are obtained by tuning the relative size between
the disks and the billiard. We define the volume V of the cavity and the

Reflecting the fact that the energy spectra of eigenvalues versus the disk size
show a multitude of level repulsions, P-V characteristics shows the anomalous

both regimes of weakly and strongly interacting oscillators from which
interesting results arise concerning the coherence properties of the joint and
the reduced system states. The strong coupling regime is required to achieve a
large frequency shift of the oscillator normal modes, making it possible to
explore the whole profile of the spectral density of the reservoirs. We show
how the decoherence process may be controlled by shifting the normal mode
frequencies to regions of small spectral density of the reservoirs. Different
spectral densities of the reservoirs are considered and their effects on the
decoherence process are analyzed. For oscillators with different damping rates,
we show that the worse-quality system is improved and vice-versa, a result
which could be useful for quantum state protection. State recurrence and swap

  Bosonic Field Theories</title><description>  Quantum Field Theory (QFT) makes predictions by combining two sets of
assumptions: (1) quantum dynamics, such as a Schrodinger or Liouville equation;
(2) quantum measurement, such as stochastic collapse to an eigenfunction of a
measurement operator. A previous paper defined a classical density matrix R
encoding the statistical moments of an ensemble of states of classical
second-order Hamiltonian field theory. It proved Tr(RQ)=E(Q), etc., for the
usual field operators as defined by Weinberg, and it proved that those
observables of the classical system obey the usual Heisenberg dynamic equation.
However, R itself obeys dynamics different from the usual Liouville equation!
This paper derives those dynamics and the discrepancy between CFT and normal
form QFT in predicting any observables g(Q,P). There is some preliminary
evidence for the conjecture that the discrepancies disappear in equilibrium
states (bound states and scattering states) for finite bosonic field theories.
Even if not, they appear small enough to warrant reconsideration of CFT as a
theory of dynamics. Appendix proposes alternative closure of turbulence based
on modified Bogliubov transforms, an application where ordinary ones become
undefined.

  uncertainty relation</title><description>  The principle of complementarity is quantified in two ways: by a universal
uncertainty relation valid for arbitrary joint estimates of any two observables
from a given measurement setup, and by a general uncertainty relation valid for
the_optimal_ estimates of the same two observables when the state of the system
prior to measurement is known. A formula is given for the optimal estimate of
any given observable, based on arbitrary measurement data and prior information
about the state of the system, which generalises and provides a more robust
interpretation of previous formulas for ``local expectations'' and ``weak
values'' of quantum observables. As an example, the canonical joint measurement
of position X and momentum P corresponds to measuring the commuting operators
X_J=X+X', P_J=P-P', where the primed variables refer to an auxilary system in a
minimum-uncertainty state. It is well known that Delta X_J Delta P_J &gt;= hbar.
Here it is shown that given the_same_ physical experimental setup, and
knowledge of the system density operator prior to measurement, one can make
improved joint estimates X_est and P_est of X and P. These improved estimates
are not only statistically closer to X and P: they satisfy Delta X_est Delta
P_est &gt;= hbar/4, where equality can be achieved in certain cases. Thus one can
do up to four times better than the standard lower bound (where the latter
corresponds to the limit of_no_ prior information). Other applications include
the heterodyne detection of orthogonal quadratures of a single-mode optical
field, and joint measurements based on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations.

  continuous measurement</title><description>  Continuous observation of a quantum system yields a measurement record that
faithfully reproduces the classically predicted trajectory provided that the
measurement is sufficiently strong to localize the state in phase space but
weak enough that quantum backaction noise is negligible. We investigate the
conditions under which classical dynamics emerges, via continuous position
measurement, for a particle moving in a harmonic well with its position coupled
to internal spin. As a consequence of this coupling we find that classical
dynamics emerges only when the position and spin actions are both large
compared to $\hbar$. These conditions are quantified by placing bounds on the
size of the covariance matrix which describes the delocalized quantum coherence
over extended regions of phase space. From this result it follows that a mixed
quantum-classical regime (where one subsystem can be treated classically and
the other not) does not exist for a continuously observed spin 1/2 particle.
When the conditions for classicallity are satisfied (in the large-spin limit),
the quantum trajectories reproduce both the classical periodic orbits as well
as the classically chaotic phase space regions. As a quantitative test of this
convergence we compute the largest Lyapunov exponent directly from the measured
quantum trajectories and show that it agrees with the classical value.

divides a one dimensional box into two halves. The two half boxes contain the
same (fixed) number of noninteracting bosons, are kept at the same temperature,
and admit the same boundary conditions at the outer walls; the only difference
is the distinct boundary conditions imposed at the two sides of the partition
wall. The net force acting on the partition wall is nonzero at zero temperature
and remains almost constant for low temperatures. As the temperature increases,
the force starts to decrease considerably, but after reaching a minimum it
starts to increase, and tends to infinity with a square-root-of-temperature
asympotics. This example demonstrates clearly that distinct boundary conditions
cause remarkable physical effects for quantum systems.

boundary conditions on a fluctuating quantum field. Although this analysis
provides a clean and calculationally tractable idealization, it does not always
accurately capture the characteristics of real materials, which cannot
constrain the modes of the fluctuating field at all energies. We study the
vacuum polarization energy of renormalizable, continuum quantum field theory in
the presence of a background field, designed to impose a Dirichlet boundary
condition in a particular limit. We show that in two and three space
dimensions, as a background field becomes concentrated on the surface on which
the Dirichlet boundary condition would eventually hold, the Casimir energy
diverges. This result implies that the energy depends in detail on the
properties of the material, which are not captured by the idealized boundary
conditions. This divergence does not affect the force between rigid bodies, but
it does invalidate calculations of Casimir stresses based on idealized boundary
conditions.

[SU(2) \otimes SU(2)] writes any two-qubit quantum computation as a composition
of a local unitary, a relative phasing of Bell states, and a second local
unitary. Using Lie theory, we generalize this to an n-qubit decomposition, the
concurrence canonical decomposition (C.C.D.) SU(2^n)=KAK. The group K fixes a
bilinear form related to the concurrence, and in particular any computation in
K preserves the tangle |&lt;phi^*|(-i sigma^y_1)...(-i sigma^y_n)|phi&gt;|^2 for n
even. Thus, the C.C.D. shows that any n-qubit quantum computation is a
composition of a computation preserving this n-tangle, a computation in A which
applies relative phases to a set of GHZ states, and a second computation which
preserves it.
  As an application, we study the extent to which a large, random unitary may
change concurrence. The result states that for a randomly chosen a in A within
SU(2^{2p}), the probability that a carries a state of tangle 0 to a state of
maximum tangle approaches 1 as the even number of qubits approaches infinity.
Any v=k_1 a k_2 for such an a \in A has the same property. Finally, although
|&lt;phi^*|(-i sigma^y_1)...(-i sigma^y_n)|phi&gt;|^2 vanishes identically when the
number of qubits is odd, we show that a more complicated C.C.D. still exists in
which K is a symplectic group.

oscillators, the effective interaction is evaluated to second order in the
coupling constant (the anharmonicity parameter). The interaction has the form
of a renormalized two-dimensional delta-function potential, with the
renormalization scale determined by the physical parameters of the system, such
as density of atoms and the detuning of the photons relative to the resonance
frequency of the atoms. For realistic values of the parameters, the
perturbation series has to be resummed, and the effective interaction becomes
independent of the ``bare'' strength of the anharmonic term. The resulting
expression for the non-linear Kerr susceptibility, is parametrically equal to
the one found earlier for a dilute gas of two-level atoms. Using our result for
the effective interaction parameter, we derive conditions for the formation of
a photon fluid, both for Rydberg atoms in a microwave cavity and for alkali

provided that the original loss in the channel is so big that Eve can obtain
2^k copies of what Bob receives, where k is the length of the seed key
pre-shared by Alice and Bob. Substantial improvements over such an exhaustive
key search attack can be made, whenever a key is reused. Furthermore, we remark
that, under the same assumption of a known or non-random plaintext, Grover's
exhaustive key search attack can be applied directly to &quot;secure communication
using mesoscopic coherent states&quot;, whenever the channel loss is more than 50
percent. Therefore, as far as information-theoretic security is concerned,
optically amplified signals necessarily degrade the security of the proposed
scheme, when the plaintext is known or non-random. Our attacks apply even if
the mesoscopic scheme is used only for key generation with a subsequent use of
the key for one-time-pad encryption.

shown to lead to oscillations in the exchange energy between neighbouring
phosphorus donor electron states in silicon \cite{Koiller02,Koiller02A}. These
same effects lead to an extreme sensitivity of the exchange energy on the
relative orientation of the donor atoms, an issue of crucial importance in the
construction silicon-based spin quantum computers. In this article we calculate
the donor electron exchange coupling as a function of donor position
incorporating the full Bloch structure of the Kohn-Luttinger electron
wavefunctions. It is found that due to the rapidly oscillating nature of the
terms they produce, the periodic part of the Bloch functions can be safely
ignored in the Heitler-London integrals as was done by Koiller et. al. [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 88,027903(2002),Phys. Rev. B. 66,115201(2002)], significantly
reducing the complexity of calculations.
  We address issues of fabrication and calculate the expected exchange coupling
between neighbouring donors that have been implanted into the silicon substrate
using an 15keV ion beam in the so-called 'top down' fabrication scheme for a
Kane solid-state quantum computer. In addition we calculate the exchange
coupling as a function of the voltage bias on control gates used to manipulate
the electron wavefunctions and implement quantum logic operations in the Kane
proposal, and find that these gate biases can be used to both increase and
decrease the magnitude of the exchange coupling between neighbouring donor
electrons. The zero-bias results reconfirm those previously obtained by
Koiller.

searching: Given a subset S of size n from the universe [m], store S so that
queries of the form &quot;What is the predecessor of x in S?&quot; can be answered
efficiently. We study this problem in the cell probe model introduced by Yao.
Recently, Beame and Fich obtained optimal bounds on the number of probes needed
by any deterministic query scheme if the associated storage scheme uses only
n^{O(1)} cells of word size (\log m)^{O(1)} bits. We give a new lower bound
proof for this problem that matches the bounds of Beame and Fich. Our lower
bound proof has the following advantages: it works for randomised query schemes
too, while Beame and Fich's proof works for deterministic query schemes only.
It also extends to `quantum address-only' query schemes that we define in this
paper, and is simpler than Beame and Fich's proof. We prove our lower bound
using the round elimination approach of Miltersen, Nisan, Safra and Wigderson.
Using tools from information theory, we prove a strong round elimination lemma
for communication complexity that enables us to obtain a tight lower bound for
the predecessor problem. Our strong round elimination lemma also extends to
quantum communication complexity. We also use our round elimination lemma to
obtain a rounds versus communication tradeoff for the `greater-than' problem,
improving on the tradeoff in Miltersen et al. We believe that our round
elimination lemma is of independent interest and should have other
applications.

the presence of polarization gradients and atomic motion. This extended model
is employed to make quantitative comparisons with the measurements of Ref. [1]

  Excitation: Theoretical Analysis</title><description>  In an atomic interferometer, the phase shift due to rotation is proportional
to the area enclosed by the split components of the atom. However, this model
is unclear for an atomic interferometer demonstrated recently by Shahriar et
al., for which the atom simply passes through a single-zone optical beam,
consisting of a pair of bichromatic counter-propagating beams. During the
passage, the atomic wave packets in two distinct internal states couple to each
other continuously. The two internal states trace out a complicated trajectory,
guided by the optical beams, with the amplitude and spread of each wavepacket
varying continuously. Yet, at the end of the single-zone excitation, there is
an interference with fringe amplitudes that can reach a visibility close to
unity. For such a situation, it is not clear how one would define the area of
the interferometer, and therefore, what the rotation sensitivity of such an
interferometer would be. In this paper we analyze this interferometer in order
to determine its rotation sensitivity, and thereby determine its effective
area. In many ways, the continuous interferometer (CI) can be thought of as a
limiting version of the Borde-Chu Interferometer (BCI). We identify a quality
factor that can be used to compare the performance of these interferometers.
Under conditions of practical interest, we show that the rotation sensitivity
of the CI can be comparable to that of the BCI. The relative simplicity of the
CI (e.g., elimination of the task of precise angular alignment of the three
zones) then makes it a potentially better candidate for practical atom
interferometry for rotation sensing.

with different evolution paths proposed in [E. Farhi, et al.,
arXiv:quant-ph/0208135]. The algorithm is applied to a random binary
optimization problem (a version of the 3-Satisfiability problem) where the
n-bit cost function is symmetric with respect to the permutation of individual
bits. The evolution paths are produced, using the generic control Hamiltonians
H(\tau) that preserve the bit symmetry of the underlying optimization problem.
In the case where the ground state of H(0) coincides with the totally-symmetric
state of an n-qubit system the algorithm dynamics is completely described in
terms of the motion of a spin-n/2.
  We show that different control Hamiltonians can be parameterized by a set of
independent parameters that are expansion coefficients of H(\tau) in a certain
universal set of operators. Only one of these operators can be responsible for
avoiding the tunnelling in the spin-n/2 system during the quantum adiabatic
algorithm. We show that it is possible to select a coefficient for this
operator that guarantees a polynomial complexity of the algorithm for all
problem instances. We show that a successful evolution path of the algorithm
always corresponds to the trajectory of a classical spin-n/2 and provide a
complete characterization of such paths.

implemented fast. They can correct the errors corresponding to the first few
orders in the Taylor expansion of the Hamiltonian of the interaction with the
environment. If implemented fast enough, the zeroth order error predominates
and the dominant effect is of error prevention by measurement (Zeno Effect)
rather than correction. In this ``Zeno Regime'', codes with less redundancy are
sufficient for protection. We describe such a simple scheme, which uses two
``noiseless'' qubits to protect a large number, $n$, of information qubits from
noise from the environment. The ``noisless qubits'' can be realized by treating
them as logical qubits to be encoded by one of the previously introduced
encoding schemes.

states with energies below that of the gap edge. No Bose condensation does
occur in the system proceeding from the proposed model. In quasi-classical

processing. However, copying seems rather different in the quantum regime.
Since the discovery of the universal quantum cloning machine, much has been
found from the fundamental point of view about quantum copying. But a basic
question as to the utility of universal quantum cloning remains. We have
considered its application in quantum state restoration by using cloning
circuit for state estimation. It might be expected that classical information
from the state estimation might help restore the quantum state that was
disturbed during transmission. We find that the fidelity of the final state is,
interestingly, independent of error probabilities inside the channel. However,
this also turns out to impose a severe constraint on our original aims.

  Ring Cavity</title><description>  We study the collective motion of atoms confined in an optical lattice
operating inside a high finesse ring cavity. A simplified theoretical model for
the dynamics of the system is developed upon the assumption of adiabaticity of
the atomic motion. We show that in a regime where the light shift per photon
times the number of atoms exceeds the line width of the cavity resonance, the
otherwise tiny retro-action of the atoms upon the light field becomes a
significant feature of the system, giving rise to dispersive optical
bistability of the intra-cavity field. A solution of the complete set of
classical equations of motion confirms these finding, however additional
non-adiabatic phenomena are predicted, as for example self-induced radial
breathing oscillations. We compare these results with experiments involving
laser-cooled 85Rb atoms trapped in an optical lattice inside a ring cavity with
a finesse of 180000. Temperature measurements conducted for moderate values of
the atom-cavity interaction demonstrate that intensity-noise induced heating is
kept at a very low level, a prerequisite for our further experiments. When we
operate at large values of the atom--cavity interaction we observe bistability
and breathing oscillations in excellent agreement with our theoretical

non-Hermitian time-dependent linear invariant can be used to obtain
Gaussian-type wave-packet (GTWP) solutions of the time-dependent system. This

Such a line of reasoning about the foundations of physics has brought

shall discuss the possible prospects of ur-theory -- partly with a view to
modern quantum gravity approaches, but mainly in connection with its
philosophical implications. Here, one of the crucial questions is, whether

there for simple systems always is a limited experimental basis that is common
to all potential experiments. Concepts related to transformation groups

the formulae of elementary quantum probability/ quantum inference theory in the
simple case. Planck's constant, and the Schroedinger equation are also derived
from this conceptual framework. The theory is illustrated by one and by two

  Curves</title><description>  Quantum computation with quantum data that can traverse closed timelike
curves represents a new physical model of computation. We argue that a model of
quantum computation in the presence of closed timelike curves can be formulated
which represents a valid quantification of resources given the ability to
construct compact regions of closed timelike curves. The notion of
self-consistent evolution for quantum computers whose components follow closed
timelike curves, as pointed out by Deutsch [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 44}, 3197
(1991)], implies that the evolution of the chronology respecting components
which interact with the closed timelike curve components is nonlinear. We
demonstrate that this nonlinearity can be used to efficiently solve
computational problems which are generally thought to be intractable. In
particular we demonstrate that a quantum computer which has access to closed
timelike curve qubits can solve NP-complete problems with only a polynomial
number of quantum gates.

  at arbitrary bias: the role of inelastic tunnelling</title><description>  We study the dynamics of a charge qubit, consisting of a single electron in a
double well potential, coupled to a point-contact (PC) electrometer using the
quantum trajectories formalism. In contrast with previous work, our analysis is
valid for arbitrary source-drain bias across the PC, but is restricted to the
sub-Zeno limit. We find that the dynamics is strongly affected by inelastic
tunnelling processes in the PC. These processes reduce the efficiency of the PC
as a qubit readout device, and induce relaxation even when the source-drain
bias is zero. We show that the sub-Zeno dynamics are divided into two regimes:
low- and high-bias in which the PC current and current power spectra show
markedly different behaviour. To further illustrate the division between the
regimes and the inefficiency of the detector, we present simulated quantum
trajectories of the conditional qubit and detector dynamics. We also describe
how single shot measurements in an arbitrary basis may be achieved in the
sub-Zeno regime.

observable of two parties by utilizing local $d$-outcome measurements with
SU($d$) transformations and classical communications. Generic symmetries of the
SU($d$) transformations and correlation observables are found for the test of
nonlocality. It is shown that these symmetries dramatically reduce the number
of numerical variables, which is important for numerical analysis of
nonlocality. A linear combination of the correlation observables, which is
reduced to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell's inequality for two
outcome measurements, is led to the Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu (CGLMP)
nonlocality test for $d$-outcome measurement. As a system to be tested for its
nonlocality, we investigate a continuous-variable (CV) entangled state with $d$
measurement outcomes. It allows the comparison of nonlocality based on
different numbers of measurement outcomes on one physical system. In our

atoms, the lasing properties of a single atom in a resonant cavity have been
theoretically investigated for more than a decade. Here we report the
experimental realization of such a one-atom laser operated in a regime of
strong coupling. Our experiment exploits recent advances in cavity quantum
electrodynamics that allow one atom to be isolated in an optical cavity in a
regime for which one photon is sufficient to saturate the atomic transition. In
this regime the observed characteristics of the atom-cavity system are
qualitatively different from those of the familiar many atom case.
Specifically, we present measurements of intracavity photon number versus pump
intensity that exhibit &quot;thresholdless&quot; behavior, and infer that the output flux
from the cavity mode exceeds that from atomic fluorescence by more than
tenfold. Observations of the second-order intensity correlation function
demonstrate that our one-atom laser generates manifestly nonclassical light
that exhibits both photon antibunching and sub-Poissonian photon statistics.

was held on an ontological ground. The completeness problem becomes more
tractable, however, if it is preliminarily discussed from a semantic viewpoint.
Indeed every physical theory adopts, explicitly or not, a truth theory for its
observative language, in terms of which the notions of semantic objectivity and
semantic completeness of the physical theory can be introduced and inquired. In
particular, standard QM adopts a verificationist theory of truth that implies
its semantic nonobjectivity; moreover, we show in this paper that standard QM
is semantically complete, which matches Bohr's thesis. On the other hand, one
of the authors has provided a Semantic Realism (or SR) interpretation of QM
that adopts a Tarskian theory of truth as correspondence for the observative
language of QM (which was previously mantained to be impossible); according to
this interpretation QM is semantically objective, yet incomplete, which matches
EPR's thesis. Thus, standard QM and the SR interpretation of QM come to
opposite conclusions. These can be reconciled within an integrationist
perspective that interpretes non-Tarskian theories of truth as theories of
metalinguistic concepts different from truth.

  possible motion: The 2-slit problem with attempted detection</title><description>  Starting with a down to earth interpretation of quantum mechanics for a free
particle, the disappearance and reappearance of interference in the 2 slit
problem with a detector behind one are treated in detail. A partial
interpretation of quantum theory is employed which is simple, emphasizing
description, yet adequate for addressing the present problem.
  Given that the eigenvalue equation is essential to predict a free particle's
probability of collision, it is argued that there is equal need for a realistic
theory to describe its possible motion. Feynman's point-to-point space-time
wave packet is put forth and used as the appropriate description of the
field-free motion between collisions.
  For a particle in a conventional 2-slit experiment with attempted detection
behind one, the disappearance of interference is explained - both when the
detection succeeds and when it doesn't. Also a definite prediction is made,
when the inter-slit distance is reduced, of where the first signs of
interference should appear on the detection screen.

explicitly. It is non-canonical in that the usual coordinate and linear
momentum commutation relations are abandoned in favour of Wigner's suggestion
that Hamilton's equations and the Heisenberg equations are identical as
operator equations. The construction is based on the use of Fock states
corresponding to a family of irreducible representations of the Lie
superalgebra sl(1|3n) indexed by an A-superstatistics parameter p. These
representations are typical for p\geq 3n but atypical for p&lt;3n. The branching
rules for the restriction from sl(1|3n) to gl(1) \oplus so(3) \oplus sl(n) are
used to enumerate energy and angular momentum eigenstates. These are
constructed explicitly and tabulated for n\leq 2. It is shown that measurements
of the coordinates of the individual particles gives rise to a set of discrete
values defining nests in the 3-dimensional configuration space. The fact that
the underlying geometry is non-commutative is shown to have a significant
impact on measurements of particle separation. In the atypical case, exclusion
phenomena are identified that are entirely due to the effect of
A-superstatistics. The energy spectrum and associated degeneracies are
calculated for an infinite-dimensional realisation of the Wigner quantum
oscillator model obtained by summing over all p. The results are compared with
those applying to the analogous canonical quantum oscillator.

parameters by observations is considered. The only general method of this kind
is the root model based on the representation of the probability density as a
squared absolute value of a certain function, which is referred to as a
psi-function in analogy with quantum mechanics. The psi-function is represented
by an expansion in terms of an orthonormal set of functions. It is shown that
the introduction of the psi-function allows one to represent the Fisher
information matrix as well as statistical properties of the estimator of the
state vector (state estimator) in simple analytical forms. A new statistical
characteristic, a confidence cone, is introduced instead of a standard
confidence interval. The chi-square test is considered to test the hypotheses
that the estimated vector converges to the state vector of a general population
and that both samples are homogeneous. The expansion coefficients are estimated
by the maximum likelihood method. The method proposed may be applied to its
full extent to solve the statistical inverse problem of quantum mechanics (root
estimator of quantum states). In order to provide statistical completeness of
the analysis, it is necessary to perform measurements in mutually complementing
experiments (according to the Bohr terminology). The maximum likelihood
technique and likelihood equation are generalized in order to analyze quantum
mechanical experiments. It is shown that the requirement for the expansion to
be of a root kind can be considered as a quantization condition making it
possible to choose systems described by quantum mechanics from all statistical
models consistent, on average, with the laws of classical mechanics.

natural classification of quantum systems into those containing coupled states

breaking it. In section 5, the above approach is related to Pauli's original

shows that entanglement is characterized by various two-particle symmetry
properties. These symmetry properties are destroyed by disentanglement but
photon helicity is conserved. This is sufficient to account for the
correlations needed to resolve the EPR paradox. Apart from a numerical factor,
the functional form for the correlations due to entanglement and
disentanglement is identical, thereby making it difficult to distinguish

systems such as atoms, molecules or quantum dots is a the ultimate tool for
many diverse fields such as laser control of chemical reactions, atom optics,
high-precision metrology and quantum computing. Rabi oscillations are one of
the simplest, yet potentially quite useful mechanisms for achieving such

drive leads to the periodic and complete population oscillations between the
two system levels. In this paper an analytic optimization algorithm for
producing Rabi-like oscillations in the general discrete many-level quantum

plate. In such a device the signal and idler waves are at the same time
linearly coupled by the plate and nonlinearly coupled by the $\chi^{(2)}$

the signal and idler modes. We describe here a complete model taking into

computation. In this article we propose a new method for measuring the spin of
a single electron confined in a quantum dot (QD). Our strategy is based on
entangling (using unitary gates) the spin and orbital degrees of freedom. An
{\em orbital qubit}, defined by a second, empty QD, is used as an ancilla and
is prepared in a known initial state. Measuring the orbital qubit will reveal
the state of the (unknown) initial spin qubit, hence reducing the problem to
the easier task of single charge measurement. Since spin-charge conversion is
done with unit probability, single-shot measurement of an electronic spin can
be, in principle, achieved. We evaluate the robustness of our method against
various sources of error and discuss briefly possible implementations.

Our method of solution motivates a new classification scheme for quantum

targeting&quot; wherein the goal is to pass a test for a target state even though
the system upon which the test is performed is submitted prior to learning the
target state's identity. Success in state targeting can be described as having
some control over the outcome of the test. We show that increasing one's
control above a minimum amount implies an unavoidable increase in the
probability of failing the test. This is analogous to the unavoidable
disturbance to a quantum state that results from gaining information about its
identity, and can be shown to be a purely quantum effect. We provide some
applications of the results to the security analysis of cryptographic tasks
implemented between remote antagonistic parties. Although we focus on weak coin
flipping, the results are significant for other two-party protocols, such as
strong coin flipping, partially binding and concealing bit commitment, and bit
escrow. Furthermore, the results have significance not only for the traditional
notion of security in cryptography, that of restricting a cheater's ability to
bias the outcome of the protocol, but also on a novel notion of security that
arises only in the quantum context, that of cheat-sensitivity. Finally, our
analysis of state targeting leads to some interesting secondary results, for
instance, a generalization of Uhlmann's theorem and an operational
interpretation of the fidelity between two mixed states.

entanglement by a beam splitter in optics, but a key distinction is that the

An experimental realization was proposed using tunneling between two edge
channels in a strong magnetic field. Here we investigate a low-magnetic field
alternative, using multiple scattering in a quantum dot. Two pairs of
single-channel point contacts define a pair of qubits. If the scattering is
chaotic, a universal statistical description of the entanglement production

be almost independent on whether time-reversal symmetry is broken or not. We

lowest Landau levels and the rest of the many-body system of particles. This
definition came as an entropy of the probability distribution {\it \`a la}
Shannon. Fractons are charge-flux systems classified in universal classes of
particles or quasiparticles labelled by a fractal or Hausdorff dimension
defined within the interval $1 &lt; h &lt; 2$ and associated with the fractal quantum
curves of such objects. They carry rational or irrational values of spin and
the spin-statistics connection takes place in this fractal approach to the
fractional spin particles. We take into account the fractal von Neumann entropy
associated with the fractal distribution function which each universal class of
fractons satisfies. We consider the fractional quantum Hall effect-FQHE given
that fractons can model Hall states. According to our formulation entanglement
between occupaton-numbers in this context increases with the universality
classes of the quantum Hall transitions considered as fractal sets of dual
topological quantum numbers filling factors. We verify that the Hall states
have stronger entanglement between ocuppation-numbers and so we can consider
this resource for fracton quantum computing.

along the developed model. The joint signal-idler photon-number distribution is
obtained using the expectation maximization algorithm. Covariance of the signal
and idler photon-numbers equals 80 %. Statistics of the generated photon pairs
are identified to be Poissonian in our case. Distribution of the integrated
intensities of the signal and idler fields shows strong correlations between
the fields. Negative values of this distribution occurring in some regions
clearly demonstrate a nonclassical character of the light composed of photon
pairs.

force between an Au-coated sphere and a Cu-coated plate of a
microelectromechanical torsional oscillator was measured statically with an
absolute error of 0.3 pN. In addition, the Casimir pressure between two
parallel plates was determined dynamically with an absolute error of $\approx
0.6$ mPa. Within the limits of experimental and theoretical errors, the results
are in agreement with a theory that takes into account the finite conductivity

physics and thermal quantum field theory. It is shown that two theoretical
approaches to the thermal Casimir force which predict effects linear in
temperture are ruled out by these experiments. Finally, constraints on Yukawa

  Directly the Momentum Transfer using Weak Values</title><description>  A which-way measurement destroys the twin-slit interference pattern. Bohr
argued that distinguishing between two slits a distance s apart gives the
particle a random momentum transfer \wp of order h/s. This was accepted for
more than 60 years, until Scully, Englert and Walther (SEW) proposed a
which-way scheme that, they claimed, entailed no momentum transfer. Storey,
Tan, Collett and Walls (STCW) in turn proved a theorem that, they claimed,
showed that Bohr was right. This work reviews and extends a recent proposal
[Wiseman, Phys. Lett. A 311, 285 (2003)] to resolve the issue using a
weak-valued probability distribution for momentum transfer, P_wv(\wp). We show
that P_wv(\wp) must be wider than h/6s. However, its moments can still be zero
because P_wv(\wp) is not necessarily positive definite. Nevertheless, it is
measurable in a way understandable to a classical physicist. We introduce a new
measure of spread for P_wv(\wp): half of the unit-confidence interval, and
conjecture that it is never less than h/4s. For an idealized example with
infinitely narrow slits, the moments of P_wv(\wp) and of the momentum
distributions are undefined unless a process of apodization is used. We show
that by considering successively smoother initial wave functions, successively
more moments of both P_wv(\wp) and the momentum distributions become defined.
For this example the moments of P_wv(\wp) are zero, and these are equal to the
changes in the moments of the momentum distribution. We prove that this
relation holds for schemes in which the moments of P_wv(\wp) are non-zero, but
only for the first two moments. We also compare these moments to those of two
other momentum-transfer distributions and \hat{p}_f-\hat{p}_i. We find
agreement between all of these, but again only for the first two moments.

describe dynamical wavefunction collapse toward energy eigenstates, for which
it is shown that wavefunction collapse of macroscopic objects does not work
properly. In one case, a common particle position measuring situation, the
apparatus evolves to a superposition of macroscopically distinguishable states
(does not collapse to one of them as it should) because each such
particle/apparatus/environment state has precisely the same energy spectrum.
Second, assuming an experiment takes place involving collapse to one of two
possible outcomes which is permanently recorded, it is shown in general that
this can only happen in the unlikely case that the two apparatus states
corresponding to the two outcomes have disjoint energy spectra. Next, the
progressive narrowing of the energy spectrum due to the collapse mechanism is
considered. This has the effect of broadening the time evolution of objects as
the universe evolves. Two examples, one involving a precessing spin, the other
involving creation of an excited state followed by its decay, are presented in
the form of paradoxes. In both examples, the microscopic behavior predicted by
standard quantum theory is significantly altered under energy-driven collapse,
but this alteration is not observed by an apparatus when it is included in the
quantum description. The resolution involves recognition that the statevector
describing the apparatus does not collapse, but evolves to a superposition of
macroscopically different states.

security of quantum cryptographic protocols. Our analysis employs two quite
different methods. The first method uses the concept of a reference system --
in a world subject to a superselection rule, unrestricted operations can be
simulated by parties who share access to a reference system with suitable
properties. By this method, we prove that if an n-party protocol is secure in a
world subject to a superselection rule, then the security is maintained even if
the superselection rule is relaxed. However, the proof applies only to a
limited class of superselection rules, those in which the superselection
sectors are labeled by unitary irreducible representations of a compact
symmetry group. The second method uses the concept of the format of a message
sent between parties -- by verifying the format, the recipient of a message can
check whether the message could have been sent by a party who performed
charge-conserving operations. By this method, we prove that protocols subject
to general superselection rules (including those pertaining to nonabelian
anyons in two dimensions) are no more secure than protocols in the unrestricted
world. However, the proof applies only to two-party protocols. Our results show
in particular that, if no assumptions are made about the computational power of
the cheater, then secure quantum bit commitment and strong quantum coin
flipping with arbitrarily small bias are impossible in a world subject to
superselection rules.

them to produce a smaller number of more reliable pairs. If this is done with
only a forward classical side channel, the procedure is equivalent to using a
quantum error-correcting code (QECC). We instead investigate entanglement
purification protocols with two-way classical side channels (2-EPPs) for finite
block sizes. In particular, we consider the analog of the minimum distance
problem for QECCs, and show that 2-EPPs can exceed the quantum Hamming bound
and the quantum Singleton bound. We also show that 2-EPPs can achieve the rate
k/n = 1 - (t/n) \log_2 3 - h(t/n) - O(1/n) (asymptotically reaching the quantum
Hamming bound), where the EPP produces at least k good pairs out of n total
pairs with up to t arbitrary errors, and h(x) = -x \log_2 x - (1-x) \log_2
(1-x) is the usual binary entropy. In contrast, the best known lower bound on
the rate of QECCs is the quantum Gilbert-Varshamov bound k/n \geq 1 - (2t/n)
\log_2 3 - h(2t/n). Indeed, in some regimes, the known upper bound on the
asymptotic rate of good QECCs is strictly below our lower bound on the

the system of interest. Usually the environment involves a relatively large
number of degrees of freedom, this making the problem numerically intractable
from a purely quantum-mechanical point of view. To overcome this drawback, a
new class of quantum trajectories is proposed. These trajectories, based on the
same grounds as Bohmian ones, are solely associated to the system reduced
density matrix, since the evolution of the environment degrees of freedom is
not considered explicitly. Within this approach, environment effects come into
play through a time-dependent damping factor that appears in the system
equations of motion. Apart from their evident computational advantage, this
type of trajectories also results very insightful to understand the system
decoherence. In particular, here we show the usefulness of these trajectories
analyzing decoherence effects in interference phenomena, taking as a working
model the well-known double-slit experiment.

distance from a set of ensembles. For bipartite ensembles, which span the whole
bipartite Hilbert space, the measure is bounded below by average relative
entropy of entanglement. We naturally obtain a monotonicity axiom for any
measure of quantum correlation of ensembles. We evaluate this measure for
certain cases. Subsequently we use this measure to propose a complementarity
relation between our measure and the accessible information obtainable about
the ensemble under local operations. The measure along with the monotonicity
axiom are well-defined even for the case of a single system, where the
complementarity relation is seen to be yet another face of the &quot;Heisenberg
uncertainty relation&quot;.

Bell inequality for bipartite d-dimensional systems. Violation of the Bell
inequality for continuous variable (CV) systems is investigated. The violation
of the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state can exceed the Cirel'son bound,
the maximal violation is 2.96981. For finite value of squeezing parameter,
violation strength of CV states increases with dimension d. Numerical results
show that the violation strength of CV states with finite squeezing parameter

an arbitrary unknown input state (not only a coherent state) can be restored in

We generalize this concept to a partial LOCC reversal of the cloning and we

Further, we discuss a distributed LOCC reversal in optimal $1\to M$ Gaussian
cloning of coherent states which transforms it to optimal $1\to M'$ cloning for
$M'&lt;M$. Assuming the quantum cloning as a possible eavesdropping attack on
quantum communication link, the reversibility can be utilized to improve the

principles concerning time and causality. These principles, which are grounded
in ideas outside of quantum mechanics, suggest that the strange features and
paradoxes of quantum mechanics come from backward causation, in which future
events can change the past. Using these principles this paper gives a better
understanding of (and reasons for) stationary states, tunneling, wave-particle
duality, the measurement problem with the collapse of the state vector, Hardy's
paradox, non-locality, and the EPR paradox. These are only a few of the
interpretational successes, and the model will be contrasted to other popular
and/or recent interpretations. Unfortunately, this model is metaphysical,
without any predictive power.

$K_{3}$) in an undirected graph $G$ on $n$ nodes, or reject if $G$ is triangle
free. The first algorithm uses combinatorial ideas with Grover Search and makes
$\tilde{O}(n^{10/7})$ queries. The second algorithm uses $\tilde{O}(n^{13/10})$
queries, and it is based on a design concept of Ambainis~\cite{amb04} that
incorporates the benefits of quantum walks into Grover search~\cite{gro96}. The
first algorithm uses only $O(\log n)$ qubits in its quantum subroutines,
whereas the second one uses O(n) qubits. The Triangle Problem was first treated
in~\cite{bdhhmsw01}, where an algorithm with $O(n+\sqrt{nm})$ query complexity
was presented, where $m$ is the number of edges of $G$.

quantum circuit can be simulated by another poly-size quantum circuit with
gates of fan-in $\leq 2$ that tolerates random noise independently occurring on
all wires at the constant rate $\eta$. Recent fundamental results showing the
principal fact $\eta_0&gt;0$ give estimates like $\eta_0\geq 10^{-6}-10^{-4}$,
whereas the only upper bound known before is $\eta_0\leq 0.74$.
  In this note we improve the latter bound to $\eta_0\leq 1/2$, under the
assumption $QP\not\subseteq QNC^1$. More generally, we show that if the
decoherence rate $\eta$ is greater than 1/2, then we can not even store a
single qubit for more than logarithmic time. Our bound also generalizes to the
simulating circuits allowing gates of any (constant) fan-in $k$, in which case
we have $\eta_0\leq 1-1/k$.

can be applied to problems in any number of spatial dimensions. We also
identify a particular dimensionless ratio of potential to kinetic energies as a
key coupling constant. This coupling establishes characteristic length and time
scales for a large class of low energy quantum states, and it guides the choice
of step sizes in numerical work. Using the BCH method in conjunction with an
imaginary time rotation, we compute low energy eigenstates for several quantum
systems coupled to non-trivial background potentials. The approach is
subsequently applied to the study of 1D propagating wave packets and 2D bound
state time development. Failures of classical expectations uncovered by
simulations of these simple systems help develop quantum intuition.
  Finally, we investigate the response of a Superconducting Quantum

structure, there is no indeterminacy in the choice of the creation operators
that create quanta out of a given vacuum. In these cases the notion of a
quantum is universal, i.e., independent of the observer on classical phase
space. Such is the case in all standard applications of quantum mechanics.
However, recent developments suggest that the notion of a quantum may not be
universal. Transformations between observers that do not agree on the notion of
an elementary quantum are called dualities. Classical phase spaces admitting
more than one complex-differentiable structure thus provide a natural framework
to study dualities in quantum mechanics. As an example we quantise a classical
mechanics whose phase space is a torus and prove explicitly that it exhibits
dualities.

separating the quantum evolution equation into Markovian and interference
terms. As a result of this separation, it is possible to show analytically that
the quadratic increase in the variance of the quantum walker's position with
time is a direct consequence of the coherence of the quantum evolution. If the
evolution is decoherent, as in the classical case, the variance is shown to
increase linearly with time, as expected. Furthermore we show that this system
has an evolution operator analogous to that of a resonant quantum kicked rotor.
As this rotator may be described through a quantum computational algorithm, one
may employ this algorithm to describe the time evolution of the quantum walker.

Hamilton was considered. Based on the principle of superposition of state, the
eigenstate of the system with Heisenberg exchange integral, the sum of a
positive term and a negative term, and the energy (relative to exchange
interaction) eigenvalue were attained. When the positive term is equal to the
absolute value of the negative term, the system is in the spin glass state, the
probabilities of parallel and antiparallel arrange for every pair of spins of
electron of nearest neighbours in the system are equal. When the positive term
is not equal to the absolute value of the negative term,the probabilities are

lower than that when only ferromagnetic states or antiferromagnetic state
exists as in previous theory. Weiss ferromagnetic state or Neel anti

finite number of identically prepared quantum systems from data obtained in a
sequence of ideal (von Neumann) measurements, each performed on an individual
copy of the system. In contrast to previous approaches, we do not average over
the possible unknown states but work out a ``typical'' probability distribution
on the set of states, as implied by the experimental data. As a consequence,
any measure of knowledge about the unknown state and thus any notion of ``best
strategy'' (i.e. the choice of observables to be measured, and the number of
times they are measured) depend on the unknown state. By learning from
previously obtained data, the experimentalist re-adjusts the observable to be
measured in the next step, eventually approaching an optimal strategy. We
consider two measures of knowledge and exhibit all ``best'' strategies for the
case of a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss some features of
the problem in higher dimensions and in the infinite dimensional case.

optimization technique, which we call the Palindrome Transform, that can be

consisting of concatenations of palindromic subcircuits. For a fixed column
ordering of two-level decomposition, we then give an numerative algorithm for
minimal (n-1)-controlled-NOT circuit construction, which we call the
Palindromic Optimization Algorithm. Our work dramatically reduces the number of
gates generated by the conventional two-level decomposition method for
constructing quantum circuits of (n-1)-controlled single-qubit and

interacting with a chain of exterior systems $\bigotimes_\N \H$, one after the
other, during a small interval of time $h$ and following some Hamiltonian $H$
on $\H_0 \otimes \H$. We discuss the passage to the limit to continuous
interactions ($h \to 0$) in a setup which allows to compute the limit of this
Hamiltonian evolution in a single state space: a continuous field of exterior
systems $\otimes_{\R} \H$. Surprisingly, the passage to the limit shows the
necessity for 3 different time scales in $H$. The limit evolution equation is
shown to spontaneously produce quantum noises terms: we obtain a quantum
Langevin equation as limit of the Hamiltonian evolution. For the very first
time, these quantum Langevin equations are obtained as the effective limit from
repeated to continuous interactions and not only as a model. These results
justify the usual quantum Langevin equations considered in continual quantum
measurement or in quantum optics. We show that the three time scales correspond
to the normal regime, the weak coupling limit and the low density limit. Our
approach allows to consider these two physical limits altogether for the first
time. Their combination produces an effective Hamiltonian on the small system,
which had never been described before. We apply these results to give an
Hamiltonian description of the von Neumann measurement. We also consider the
approximation of continuous time quantum master equations by discrete time
ones. In particular we show how any Lindblad generator is obtained as the limit
of completely positive maps.

Interferometer. Since the development of the causal interpretation of
relativistic boson fields there have not been any applications for which the
equations of motion for the field have been solved explicitly. Here, we provide
perhaps the first application of the causal interpretation of boson fields for
which the equations of motion are solved. Specifically, we consider the
electromagnetic field. Solving the equations of motion allows us to develop a
relativistic causal model of the Wheeler delayed-choice Mach-Zehnder
Interferometer. We show explicitly that a photon splits at a beam splitter. We
also demonstrate the inherent nonlocal nature of a relativistic quantum field.
This is particularly revealed in a which-path measurement where a quantum is
nonlocally absorbed from both arms of the interferometer. This feature explains
how when a photon is split by a beam splitter it nevertheless registers on a
detector in one arm of the interferometer. Bohm et al \cite{BDH85} have argued
that a causal model of a Wheeler delayed-choice experiment avoids the paradox
of creating or changing history, but they did not provide the details of such a
model. The relativistic causal model we develop here serves as a detailed
example which demonstrates this point, though our model is in terms of a field
picture rather than the particle picture of the Bohm-de Broglie nonrelativistic
causal interpretation.

Wolfram, have argued that quantum mechanics will break down before the
factoring of large numbers becomes possible. If this is true, then there should
be a natural set of quantum states that can account for all experiments
performed to date, but not for Shor's factoring algorithm. We investigate as a
candidate the set of states expressible by a polynomial number of additions and
tensor products. Using a recent lower bound on multilinear formula size due to
Raz, we then show that states arising in quantum error-correction require
n^{Omega(log n)} additions and tensor products even to approximate, which
incidentally yields the first superpolynomial gap between general and
multilinear formula size of functions. More broadly, we introduce a complexity
classification of pure quantum states, and prove many basic facts about this
classification. Our goal is to refine vague ideas about a breakdown of quantum
mechanics into specific hypotheses that might be experimentally testable in the
near future.

measuring interference of polarized photons through single-photon detectors. In
comparison with the original proposal by S. Bose, P.L. Knight, M.B. Plenio, and

a high fidelity of almost unity, and inherent robustness, such as the
insensitivity of fidelity to randomness in the atom's position, and to
detection inefficiency. All these favorable features make the scheme feasible

quantum state can be retrieved up to a unitary transformation depicted by the
non-Abelian Berry's geometric phase factor (holonomy). The QIS of photon with
this geometric character can be implemented with the symmetric collective
excitations of a $\Lambda$-atom ensemble, which is adiabatically controlled by
a classical light with a small detuning $\delta$. The cyclic change of the
controlled Rabi frequency $\Omega(t)$ with period $T=\frac{2n\pi}{\delta}$
accumulates additional geometric phases in different components of the final
photon state. Then, in a purely geometric way the stored state can be decoded

Quantum limits on communication and information storage leading to these
conclusions are here described. Quantum channel capacity theory is reviewed for
both steady state and burst communication. An analytic approximation is given
for the maximum signal information possible with occupation number signal
states as a function of mean signal energy. A theorem guaranteeing that these
states are optimal for communication is proved. A heuristic &quot;proof&quot; of the
linear bound on communication is given, followed by rigorous proofs for signals
with specified mean energy, and for signals with given energy budget. And
systems of many parallel quantum channels are shown to obey the linear bound
for a natural channel architecture. The time--energy uncertainty principle is
reformulated in information language by means of the linear bound. The quantum
bound on information storage capacity of quantum mechanical and quantum field
devices is reviewed. A simplified version of the analytic proof for the bound
is given for the latter case. Solitons as information caches are discussed, as
is information storage in one dimensional systems. The influence of signal
self--gravitation on communication is considerd. Finally, it is shown that
acceleration of a receiver acts to block information transfer.

through public channel when he receives Alice's first qubit. Alice performs her
encoding operations on the second qubit and sends this qubit to Bob. Bob
performs a Bell-basis measurement to draw Alice's information. The security of
this protocol is based on `High fidelity implies low entropy'. If Eve want to
eavesdrop Alice's information, she has to attack both qubits of the EPR pair,
which results in that any effective eavesdropping attack can be detected. Bob's

using fidelity, and discuss the classical limit for the state. The measured
fidelity for the input state is 0.85$\pm$ 0.05 which is higher than the
classical case of 0.73$\pm$0.04. We also verify that the teleportation process
operates properly for the nonclassical state input and its squeezed variance is
certainly transferred through the process. We observe the smaller variance of

short) method are two main quantum lower bound techniques. While recently
Ambainis showed that the polynomial method is not tight, the present paper aims
at studying the power and limitation of \emph{Alb}'s. We first use known
\emph{Alb}'s to derive $\Omega(n^{1.5})$ lower bounds for
\textsc{Bipartiteness}, \textsc{Bipartiteness Matching} and \textsc{Graph
Matching}, in which the lower bound for \textsc{Bipartiteness} improves the
previous $\Omega(n)$ one. We then show that all the three known Ambainis's
lower bounds have a limitation $\sqrt{N\cdot \min\{C_0(f), C_1(f)\}}$, where
$C_0(f)$ and $C_1(f)$ are the 0- and 1-certificate complexity, respectively.
This implies that for some problems such as \textsc{Triangle},
$k$-\textsc{Clique}, and \textsc{Bipartite/Graph Matching} which draw wide
interest and whose quantum query complexities are still open, the best known
lower bounds cannot be further improved by using Ambainis's techniques. Another
consequence is that all the Ambainis's lower bounds are not tight. For total
functions, this upper bound for \emph{Alb}'s can be further improved to $\min
\{\sqrt{C_0(f)C_1(f)}, \sqrt{N\cdot CI(f)}\}$, where $CI(f)$ is the size of max
intersection of a 0-and a 1-certificate set. Again this implies that $Alb$'s
cannot improve the best known lower bound for some specific problems such as
\textsc{And-Or Tree}, whose precise quantum query complexity is still open.
Finally, we generalize the three known \emph{Alb}'s and give a new \emph{Alb}
style lower bound method, which may be easier to use for some problems.

two qubits connected by the edge, as measured by the concurrence. We prove that
each entangled graph with entanglement bounded by a specific value of the
concurrence can be represented by a pure multi-qubit state. In addition we
present a logic network with O(N2) elementary gates that can be used for
preparation of the weighted entangled graphs of N qubits.

quantum logic to serve as a model for quantum computation with recursion, such
that potentially non-terminating computation can take place, as in a quantum
Turing machine. This model is based on the extension of von Neumann's quantum
logic to partial states, defined here as sub-probability measures on the
Hilbert space, equipped with the natural pointwise partial ordering. The
sub-probability measures allow a certain probability for the non-termination of
the computation. We then derive an extension of Gleason's theorem and show
that, for Hilbert spaces of dimension greater than two, the partial order of
sub-probability measures is order isomorphic with the collection of partial
density operators, i.e., trace class positive operators with trace between zero
and one, equipped with the usual partial ordering induced from positive
operators. We show that the expected value of a bounded observable with respect
to a partial state can be defined as a closed bounded interval, which extends
the classical definition of expected value.

assume that the perturbation is time independent, random and orthogonally
invariant. This allows to use a basis in which the unperturbed Hamiltonian is
diagonal and its properties are thus largely determined by its spectral
statistics. We concentrate on the effect of spectral correlations usually
associated to chaos and disregard secular variations in spectral density. We
obtain analytic results for the fidelity decay in the linear response regime.
To extend the domain of validity, we heuristically exponentiate the linear
response result. The resulting expressions, exact in the perturbative limit,
are accurate approximations in the transition region between the ``Fermi golden
rule'' and the perturbative regimes, as examplarily verified for a
deterministic chaotic system. To sense the effect of spectral stiffness, we
apply our model also to the extreme cases of random spectra and equidistant
spectra. In our analytical approximations as well as in extensive Monte Carlo
calculations, we find that fidelity decay is fastest for random spectra and
slowest for equidistant ones, while the classical ensembles lie in between. We
conclude that spectral stiffness systematically enhances fidelity.

reduced time evolution. In contrast to the frequently considered case of an
initial preparation where the total density matrix factorizes into a product of
a system density matrix and a bath density matrix the time evolution generally
is no longer governed by a linear map nor is this map affine. Put differently,
the evolution is truly nonlinear and cannot be cast into the form of a linear
map plus a term that is independent of the initial density matrix of the open
quantum system. As a consequence, the inhomogeneity that emerges in formally
exact generalized master equations is in fact a nonlinear term that vanishes
for a factorizing initial state. The general results are elucidated with the
example of two interacting spins prepared at thermal equilibrium with one spin
subjected to an external field. The second spin represents the environment. The
field allows the preparation of mixed density matrices of the first spin that
can be represented as a convex combination of two limiting pure states, i.e.
the preparable reduced density matrices make up a convex set. Moreover, the map
from these reduced density matrices onto the corresponding density matrices of
the total system is affine only for vanishing coupling between the spins. In
general, the set of the accessible total density matrices is nonconvex.

problem for a given time-independent potential, for each state of the whole
quantum ensemble of identically prepared particles, there is an unique pair of
(subensemble's) solutions to the Schr\&quot;odinger equation, which, as we
postulate, describe separately transmission and reflection: in the case of
nonstationary states, for any instant of time, these functions are orthogonal
and their sum describes the state of all particles; evolving with constant
norms, one of them approaches at late times the transmitted wave packet and
another approaches the reflected packet. Both for transmission and reflection,
1) well before and after the scattering event, the average kinetic energy of
particles is the same, 2) the average starting point differs, in the general
case, from that for all particles. It is shown that for reflection, in the case
of symmetric potential barriers, the domain of the motion of particles is
bounded by the midpoint of the barrier region. We define (exact and asymptotic)
transmission and reflection times and show that the basic results of our

Similar to the spin-1/2 case, there appears an additional spin-dependent term

  qubits</title><description>  For two qubits in a pure state there exists a one-to-one relation between the
entanglement measure (the concurrence ${\cal C}$) and the maximal violation
${\cal M}$ of a Bell inequality. No such relation exists for the three-qubit
analogue of ${\cal C}$ (the tangle $\tau$), but we have found that numerical
data is consistent with a simple set of upper and lower bounds for $\tau$ given
${\cal M}$. The bounds on $\tau$ become tighter with increasing ${\cal M}$, so
they are of practical use. The Svetlichny form of the Bell inequality gives
tighter bounds than the Mermin form. We show that the bounds can be tightened
further if the tangle is replaced by an entanglement monotone that can identify
both the W state and the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state.

the axiomatically derived distribution of Kijowski for states with purely
positive momenta but is also applicable to general momentum components. For
particles interacting with a square barrier the mean arrival time and
corresponding ``tunneling time'' obtained at the transmission side of the
barrier becomes independent of the barrier width (Hartman effect) for
arbitrarily wide barriers, i.e., without the transition to the ultra-opaque,

the latter results from a much less stringent requirement, i.e., that only the

localization of the two-dimensional Grover walk starting from a fixed point is
striking different from other types of quantum walks. The present paper
explains the reason why the walker who moves according to the degree-four
Grover's operator can remain at the starting point with a high probability. It
is shown that the key factor for the localization is due to the degeneration of
eigenvalues of the time evolution operator. In fact, the global time evolution
of the quantum walk on a large lattice is mainly determined by the degree of
degeneration. The dependence of the localization on the initial state is also

in [1] to be inapplicable to the time-dependent vector fields and, in
particular, to the retarded solutions of Maxwell's equations. Because of this,
according to [1], a number of conclusions drawn in [2] on the basis of the
Helmholtz theorem turns out to be erroneous. The Helmholtz theorem is proved in
this letter to hold for arbitrary vector field, both static and time-dependent.
Therefore, the conclusions of the paper [2] questioned in [1] are true. The
validity of Helmholtz's theorem in the general case is due to the fact that the
decomposition above of vector field does not influence the field time
coordinate, which plays, thus, a passive role in the decomposition procedure.
An analysis is given of the mistakes made in [1]. It is noted that for point
particle the longitudinal and transverse components of electric field, taken
separately, are characterized by the infinitely great velocity of propagation.
However, superluminal contributions to the expression for the total electric
field cancel each other.

mechanics, whereas orthodox quantum mechanics is too vague to allow a sharp
definition, except perhaps in special cases. In contrast to statistical and

interact with an auxiliary system A, the initial state of which is known. A
one-to-one mapping can thus be realized between the density matrix $\hrho$ and
the probabilities of occurrence of the eigenvalues of a single and factorized
observable of S+A, so that $\hrho$ can be determined by repeated measurements
using a single apparatus. If S and A are spins, it suffices to measure
simultaneously their $z$-components after a controlled interaction. The most

completely disordered state of A. They involve an Ising or anisotropic
Heisenberg coupling and an external field.

  ground for thermodynamics and quantum mechanics</title><description>  Mechanics can be founded on a principle relating the uncertainty delta-q in
the trajectory of an observable particle to its motion relative to the
observer. From this principle, p.delta-q=const., p being the q-conjugated
momentum, mechanical laws are derived and the meaning of the Lagrangian and
Hamiltonian functions are discussed. The connection between the presented
principle and Hamilton's Least Action Principle is examined.
  Wave mechanics and Schrodinger equation appear without additional assumptions
by choosing the representation for delta-q in the case the motion is not
trajectory describable. The Cramer-Rao inequality serves that purpose. For a
particle hidden from direct observation, the position uncertainty determined by
the enclosing boundaries leads to thermodynamics in a straightforward extension
of the presented formalism.
  The introduction of uncertainty in classical mechanics formulation enables
the translation of mechanical laws into the wide ranging conceptual framework
of information theory. The boundaries between classical mechanics,
thermodynamics and quantum mechanics are defined in terms of informational
changes associated with the system evolution. As a direct application of the
proposed formulation upper bounds for the rate of information transfer are
derived.

respectively, at different stages of a cycle. Armed with this class of heat
engines and some interpretation of heat transferred and work performed at the

of thermodynamics. In particular, it is not sufficient to have the heat source
hotter than the sink, but there must be a minimum temperature difference
between the hotter source and the cooler sink before any work can be extracted
through the engines. The size of this minimum temperature difference is
dictated by that of the energy gaps of the quantum engines involved. Our new
quantum heat engines also offer a practical way, as an alternative to Szilard's
engine, to physically realise Maxwell's daemon. Inspired and motivated by the
Rabi oscillations, we further introduce some modifications to the quantum heat
engines with single-mode cavities in order to, while respecting the second law,
extract more work from the heat baths than is otherwise possible in thermal
equilibria. Some of the results above are also generalisable to quantum heat
engines of an infinite number of energy levels including 1-D simple harmonic

Recent experiments have shown that it is possible to reduce the thermal motion

)/i\partial \omega =\hat{\tau}(\omega ,{\bf r}) S(\omega ,{\bf r})$ for
$S$-matrix with temporal operator instead the Hamiltonian is established via
the Legendre transformation of classical action function. Corresponding
temporal functions are expressed via propagators of interacting fields. Their
real parts $\tau_{1}$are equivalent to the Wigner-Smith delay durations at
process of scattering and imaginary parts $\tau_{2}$ express the duration of
final states formation (dressing). As an apparent example, they can be clearly
interpreted in the oscillator model via polarization ($% \tau_{1}$) and
conductivity ($\tau_{2}$) of medium. The $\tau $-functions are interconnected
by the dispersion relations of Kramers-Kr\&quot;{o}nig type. From them follows, in
particular, that $\tau_{2}$ is twice bigger than the uncertainty value and
thereby is measurable; it must be negative at some tunnel transitions and thus
can explain the observed superluminal transfer of excitations at near field
intervals (M.E.Perel'man. In: arXiv. physics/0309123). The covariant
generalizations of reciprocal equation clarifies the adiabatic hypothesis of
scattering theory as the requirement: $% \tau_{2}\to 0$ at infinity future and

  well: Proposals for creating macroscopic quantum superposition states and a
  study of quantum chaos</title><description>  We present a quantum phase space model of Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in a
double well potential. In a two-mode Fock-state analysis we examine the
eigenvectors and eigenvalues and find that the energy correlation diagram
indicates a transition from a delocalized to a fragmented regime. Phase space
information is extracted from the stationary quantum states using the Husimi
distribution function. It is shown that the quantum states are localized on the
known classical phase space orbits of a nonrigid physical pendulum, and thus
the novel phase space characteristics of a nonrigid physical pendulum such as
the $\pi$ motions are seen to be a property of the exact quantum states. Low
lying states are harmonic oscillator like libration states while the higher
lying states are Schr\&quot;odinger cat-like superpositions of two pendulum rotor
states. To study the dynamics in phase space, a comparison is made between a
displaced quantum wavepacket and the trajectories of a swarm of points in
classical phase space. For a driven double well, it is shown that the classical
chaotic dynamics is manifest in the dynamics of the quantum states pictured
using the Husimi distribution. Phase space analogy also suggests that a $\pi$
phase displaced wavepacket put on the unstable fixed point on a separatrix will
bifurcate to create a superposition of two pendulum rotor states - a
Schr\&quot;odinger cat state (number entangled state) for BEC. It is shown that the
choice of initial barrier height and ramping, following a $\pi$ phase
imprinting on the condensate, can be used to generate controlled entangled
number states with tunable extremity and sharpness.

string states.The conducting line of argument is the classical-quantum (de
Broglie, Compton) duality here extended to the quantum gravity (string) regime
(wave-particle-string duality). The semiclassical (QFT) and quantum (string)
gravity regimes are respectively characterized and related: sizes, masses,
accelerations and temperatures. The Hawking temperature, elementary particle
and string temperatures are shown to be the same concept in different energy
regimes and turn out the precise classical-quantum duals of each other;
similarly, this result holds for the BH decay rate, heavy particle and string
decay rates; BH evaporation ends as quantum string decay into pure (non mixed)
radiation. Microscopic density of states and entropies in the two
(semiclassical and quantum) gravity regimes are derived and related, an
unifying formula for BH, dS and AdS states is provided in the two regimes. A
string phase transition towards the dS string temperature (which is shown to be
the precise quantum dual of the semiclassical (Hawking-Gibbons) dS temperature)
is found and characterized; such phase transition does not occurs in AdS alone.
High string masses (temperatures) show a further (square root temperature
behaviour) sector in AdS. From the string mass spectrum and string density of
states in curved backgrounds, quantum properties of the backgrounds themselves
are extracted and the quantum mass spectrum of BH, dS and AdS radii obtained.

demonstrate a quantum key distribution protocol based on the transmission of
gaussian-modulated coherent states (consisting of laser pulses containing a few
hundred photons) and shot-noise-limited homodyne detection; squeezed or

using a reverse reconciliation technique followed by privacy amplification. The
reverse reconciliation technique is in principle secure for any value of the
line transmission, against gaussian individual attacks based on entanglement
and quantum memories. Our table-top experiment yields a net key transmission
rate of about 1.7 megabits per second for a loss-free line, and 75 kilobits per
second for a line with losses of 3.1 dB. We anticipate that the scheme should
remain effective for lines with higher losses, particularly because the present
limitations are essentially technical, so that significant margin for
improvement is available on both the hardware and software.

which can realize secure communication with high speeds and at long distance by
conventional optical devices. Recently, a criticism of the Yuen protocol, so
called Y-00, was made by Nishioka, and Imai group(Mitsubishi and University of
Tokyo), and they claimed Y-00 is essentially a classical stream cipher. This
paper shows that the claim is incorrect. In particular, it is shown that the
relation $l_i=r_i\oplus \tilde{k}_i$, which is their basis for attack, has no
essential role for any security analysis. In addition, we give a brief
introduction of the general logic for the security of Y-00 as direct encryption
and also for key generation.
  Several industries have started to make a test-bed of Y-00 for digital
optical fiber highway, following Kumar's leading work. We hope that this
discussion encourages experimental works which realize a secure communication
against quantum computer and quantum attacks based on physical principle.

  Heisenberg Chain in the Presence of Domain Walls</title><description>  We discuss entanglement in the spin-1/2 anisotropic ferromagnetic Heisenberg
chain in the presence of a boundary magnetic field generating domain walls. By
increasing the magnetic field, the model undergoes a first-order quantum phase
transition from a ferromagnetic to a kink-type phase, which is associated to a
jump in the content of entanglement available in the system. Above the critical
point, pairwise entanglement is shown to be non-vanishing and independent of
the boundary magnetic field for large chains. Based on this result, we provide
an analytical expression for the entanglement between arbitrary spins. Moreover
the effects of the quantum domains on the gapless region and for
antiferromagnetic anisotropy are numerically analysed. Finally multiparticle
entanglement properties are considered, from which we establish a
characterization of the critical anisotropy separating the gapless regime from
the kink-type phase.

the state of a single qubit from a quantum-mechanical superposition to a
classical mixed state. This paper uses a Bloch-Redfield approach to study how,
in a system of two qubits, dissipation drives the bipartite state of the two
qubits from an entangled state to a product state. The measure used for
mixed-state entanglement is Wootters's formula for the entanglement of
formation. For qubits that start in an entangled state and are then decoupled,
entanglement is found to decay faster in general than the decoherence of single
qubit states by a factor $2/\log 2$ that can be obtained analytically in a
limiting case. We show that the dynamics of entanglement for realistic
parameters is different from that of fidelity: for some experimental parameters
a bipartite state loses fidelity much more rapidly than it loses entanglement.
These results are of some practical interest since entanglement is thought to
be the essential ``fuel'' for fast quantum algorithms.

is the root model based on the representation of the probability density as a
squared absolute value of a certain function, which is referred to as a
psi-function in analogy with quantum mechanics. The psi-function is represented
by an expansion in terms of an orthonormal set of functions. It is shown that
the introduction of the psi-function allows one to represent the Fisher
information matrix as well as statistical properties of the estimator of the
state vector (state estimator) in simple analytical forms. The chi-square test
is considered to test the hypotheses that the estimated vector converges to the
state vector of a general population. The method proposed may be applied to its
full extent to solve the statistical inverse problem of quantum mechanics (root
estimator of quantum states). In order to provide statistical completeness of
the analysis, it is necessary to perform measurements in mutually complementing
experiments (according to the Bohr terminology). The maximum likelihood
technique and likelihood equation are generalized in order to analyze quantum
mechanical experiments. It is shown that the requirement for the expansion to
be of a root kind can be considered as a quantization condition making it
possible to choose systems described by quantum mechanics from all statistical
models consistent, on average, with the laws of classical mechanics.

considering a multiqubit system that behaves collectively as a spin system
obeying the dynamics of the quantum kicked top. In the classical limit, the
kicked top exhibits both regular and chaotic dynamics depending on the strength
of the chaoticity parameter $\kappa$ in the Hamiltonian. We show that the
entanglement of the multiqubit system, considered for both bipartite and
pairwise entanglement, yields a signature of quantum chaos. Whereas bipartite
entanglement is enhanced in the chaotic region, pairwise entanglement is
suppressed. Furthermore, we define a time-averaged entangling power and show
that this entangling power changes markedly as $\kappa$ moves the system from
being predominantly regular to being predominantly chaotic, thus sharply
identifying the edge of chaos. When this entangling power is averaged over
initial states, it yields a signature of global chaos. The qualitative behavior
of this global entangling power is similar to that of the classical Lyapunov
exponent.

  mechanics: A unified C*-algebraic approach</title><description>  Quantum mechanics is essentially a statistical theory. Classical mechanics,
however, is usually not viewed as being inherently statistical. Nevertheless,
the latter can also be formulated statistically. Furthermore, a statistical
formulation of both can be expressed in terms of unital C*-algebras, in which
case it becomes clear that they have the same general structure, with quantum
mechanics a noncommutative generalization of the classical case. In purely
mathematical terms it is seen that quantum mechanics is a noncommutative
generalization of probability theory. The most important insight in this
respect is that the projection postulate of quantum mechanics is a
noncommutative conditional probability. This is the subject of Chapter 1 of the
thesis.
  As ergodic theory (the long term behaviour of a dynamical system) is done in
classical probability theory, it is then also done for noncommutative
probability theory in Chapter 2. In particular, generalizations of Khintchine's
recurrence theorem and a variation thereof for ergodic systems are proved, as
well as various characterizations of noncommutative ergodicity.
  Lastly, in Chapter 3, recurrence and ergodicity is then investigated from a
physical perspective in quantum and classical mechanics, by means of a quantum
mechanical analogue of Liouville's Theorem in classical mechanics which was
suggested in Chapter 1.

in the system Hamiltonian. Treating these fluctuations as Gaussian Markov
processes with zero mean and delta function correlation times, we derive an
exact equation of motion describing the dissipative dynamics for a system of n
qubits. We then apply this model to study the effect of noise on the quantum
teleportation and a generic quantum controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. For the quantum
CNOT gate, we study the effect of noise on a set of one- and two-qubit quantum
gates, and show that the results can be assembled together to investigate the
quality of a quantum CNOT gate operation. We compute the averaged gate fidelity
and gate purity for the quantum CNOT gate, and investigate phase, bit-flip, and
flip-flop errors during the CNOT gate operation. The effects of direct
inter-qubit coupling and fluctuations on the control fields are also studied.
We discuss the limitations and possible extensions of this model. In sum, we
demonstrate a simple model that enables us to investigate the effect of noise
in arbitrary quantum circuits under realistic device conditions.

sufficient for the experimental confirmation of the KS theorem. Hence, the

correspondence with the $S$-matrix pole. IS can have a positive as well as a
negative energy and can be treated as a generalization of the bound states
embedded in continuum on the case of discrete spectrum states. The formation of
IS in the spectrum of a quantum system is studied using a simple rank--2
separable potential with harmonic oscillator form factors. Some physical
applications are discussed, in particular, we propose a separable $NN$
potential supporting IS that describes the deuteron binding energy and the
s-wave triplet and singlet scattering phase shifts. We use this potential to
examine the so-called problem of the three-body bound state collapse discussed

drastic changes of the binding energy and of the spectrum of excited states of

useful in any way, there is an intrinsic necessity of cooperation and
communication controlled by the classical world. As a consequence, full formal
descriptions of algorithms making use of quantum principles must take into
account both quantum and classical computing components and assemble them so
that they communicate and cooperate. This paper aims at defining a high level
language allowing the description of classical and quantum programming, and
their cooperation. Since process algebras provide a framework to model
cooperating computations and have well defined semantics, they have been chosen
as a basis for this language. Starting with a classical process algebra, this
paper explains how to transform it for including quantum computation. The
result is a quantum process algebra with its operational semantics, which can
be used to fully describe quantum algorithms in their classical context.

entanglement both appear to occur under the same circumstances. To address the
connection between these two phenomena, we consider the evolution of arbitrary
initial states of a two-particle system under open system dynamics described by
a class of master equations which produce decoherence of each particle. We show
that all initial states become separable after a finite time, and we produce
the explicit form of the separated state. The result extends and amplifies an
earlier result of Di\'osi. We illustrate the general result by considering the
case in which the initial state is an EPR state (in which both the positions
and momenta of a particle pair are perfectly correlated). This example clearly
illustrates how the spreading out in phase space produced by the environment
leads to certain disentanglement conditions becoming satisfied.

curvature coupling parameter subject to Robin boundary conditions on two
parallel plates located on $D+1$ - dimensional AdS background. The general case
of different Robin coefficients on separate plates is considered. The mode
summation method is used with a combination of a variant of the generalized
Abel-Plana formula for the series over zeros of combinations of cylinder

spacetime without boundaries and boundary induced parts. The asymptotic
behavior of the vacuum densities near the plates and at large distances is
investigated. The vacuum forces acting on the boundaries are presented as a sum
of the self-action and interaction forces. The first one contains well-known
surface divergences and needs further regularization. The interaction forces
between the plates are attractive for Dirichlet scalar. We show that threre is
a region in the space of parameters defining the boundary conditions in which
the interaction forces are repulsive for small distances and attractive for
large distances. An application to the Randall-Sundrum braneworld with

that contain the qualitative features of the spectrum, i.e. crossings and
avoided crossings, as a function of the coupling constant. At a second stage
the precision of the spectrum can be improved quantitatively by standard
perturbative methods like contact transformations. We illustrate this method to
determine the spectrum of a two-level atom interacting with a single mode of a

  Global Gauge Symmetry of Klein-Gordon Fields</title><description>  For free Klein-Gordon fields, we construct a one-parameter family of
conserved current densities $J_a^\mu$, with $a\in(-1,1)$, and use the latter to
yield a manifestly covariant expression for the most general positive-definite
and Lorentz-invariant inner product on the space of solutions of the
Klein-Gordon equation. Employing a recently developed method of constructing
the Hilbert space and observables for Klein-Gordon fields, we then obtain the
probability current density ${\cal J}_a^\mu$ for the localization of a
Klein-Gordon field in space. We show that in the nonrelativistic limit both
$J_a^\mu$ and ${\cal J}_a^\mu$ tend to the probability current density for the
localization of a nonrelativistic free particle in space, but that unlike
$J_a^\mu$ the current density ${\cal J}_a^\mu$ is neither covariant nor
conserved. Because the total probability may be obtained by integrating either
of these two current densities over the whole space, the conservation of the
total probability may be viewed as a consequence of the local conservation of
$J_a^\mu$. The latter is a manifestation of a previously unnoticed global gauge
symmetry of the Klein-Gordon fields. The corresponding gauge group is U(1) if
the parameter $a$ is rational. It is the multiplicative group of positive real
numbers if $a$ is irrational. We also discuss an extension of our results to
Klein-Gordon fields minimally coupled to an electromagnetic field.

coupled to a classical control field and a quantum probe field {[Sun {\it et
al.,} Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 91}, 147903 (2003)]}. Under two-photon resonance,
we calculate the group velocity of the probe light with collective atomic
excitations. Our result gives the dependence of the group velocity on the
common one-photon detuning, and can be compared with the recent experiment (E.
E. Mikhailov, Y. V. Rostovtsev, and G. R. Welch, quant-ph/0309173).

mechanics, it is usually assumed that physical measurements concern observables
common to both theories . Not so with the eigenvalues ($\pm 1$) of the parity
operator. The effect of such a measurement on a mixture of even and odd states
of the harmonic oscillator is akin to separating at a single stroke a pair of
shuffled card decks: the result is a set of definite parity, though otherwise
mixed. The Wigner function should be a sensitive probe for this phenomenon, for
it can be interpreted as the expectation value of the parity operator. We here
derive the general form of Wigner functions $W_{\pm}$, resulting from an ideal
parity measurement on $W(\x)$. Even if $W(\x)$ resembles a classical
distribution, $W_{\pm}$ displays a quantum spike, which is positive for $W_+$
and negative for $W_-$. However we conjecture that $W_+$ always has negative
values.

methods to eigenvalue problems in the context of some deformed canonical
commutation relations leading to nonzero minimal uncertainties in position
and/or momentum. Here we determine for the first time the spectrum and the
eigenvectors of a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the presence of a
uniform electric field in terms of the deforming parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$.
We establish that whenever there is a nonzero minimal uncertainty in momentum,
i.e., for $\alpha \ne 0$, the correction to the harmonic oscillator eigenvalues
due to the electric field is level dependent. In the opposite case, i.e., for
$\alpha = 0$, we recover the conventional quantum mechanical picture of an
overall energy-spectrum shift even when there is a nonzero minimum uncertainty
in position, i.e., for $\beta \ne 0$. Then we consider the problem of a
$D$-dimensional harmonic oscillator in the case of isotropic nonzero minimal
uncertainties in the position coordinates, depending on two parameters $\beta$,
$\beta'$. We extend our methods to deal with the corresponding radial equation
in the momentum representation and rederive in a simple way both the spectrum
and the momentum radial wave functions previously found by solving the
differential equation. This opens the way to solving new $D$-dimensional
problems.

amount of correlations (and hence entanglement) in a physical system in thermal
equilibrium at some temperature in terms of its free energy and internal

the Heisenberg coupling, where entanglement and correlations can be computed
exactly. It is then applied to the one dimensional Ising model in a transverse
magnetic field, for which entanglement and correlations cannot be obtained by
exact methods. We analyze the behavior of correlations in various regimes and
identify critical regions, comparing them with already known results. Finally,
we present a general discussion of the effects of entanglement on the
macroscopic, thermodynamical features of solid-state systems. In particular, we
exploit the fact that a $d$ dimensional quantum system in thermal equilibrium
can be made to corresponds to a d+1 classical system in equilibrium to
substitute all entanglement for classical correlations.

if, by means of a protocol involving only local quantum operations and
classical communication, the two parties can transform some number of copies of
that state into a single shared pair of qubits having high fidelity with a
maximally entangled state state. In this paper it is proved that there exist
states that are distillable, but for which an arbitrarily large number of
copies is required before any distillation procedure can produce a shared pair
of qubits with even a small amount of entanglement. Specifically, for every
positive integer n there exists a state that is distillable, but given n or
fewer copies of that state every distillation procedure outputting a single
shared pair of qubits will output those qubits in a separable state.
Essentially all previous examples of states proved to be distillable were such
that some distillation procedure could output an entangled pair of qubits given
a single copy of the state in question.

an arbitrary graph G with N vertices. In particular, we consider systems of
quantum spins evolving according to one of two hamiltonians: (i) the XY
hamiltonian H_XY, which contains an XY interaction for every pair of spins
connected by an edge in G; and (ii) the Heisenberg hamiltonian H_Heis, which
contains a Heisenberg interaction term for every pair of spins connected by an
edge in G. We find that the action of the XY (respectively, Heisenberg)
hamiltonian on state space is equivalent to the action of the adjacency matrix
(respectively, combinatorial laplacian) of a sequence G_k, k=0,..., N of graphs
derived from G (with G_1=G). This equivalence of actions demonstrates that the
dynamics of these two models is the same as the evolution of a free particle
hopping on the graphs G_k. Thus we show how to replace the complicated dynamics
of the original spin model with simpler dynamics on a more complicated
geometry. A simple corollary of our approach allows us to write an explicit
spectral decomposition of the XY model in a magnetic field on the path
consisting of N vertices. We also use our approach to utilise results from
spectral graph theory to solve new spin models: the XY model and heisenberg
model in a magnetic field on the complete graph.

a driven standing wave high-Q optical resonator. Even without any direct
atom-atom interaction the atoms are coupled through their position dependent
influence on the intracavity field. For sufficiently good trapping and low
cavity losses the atomic motion becomes significantly correlated and the two
particles oscillate in their wells preferentially with a 90 degrees relative
phase shift. The onset of correlations seriously limits cavity cooling
efficiency, raising the achievable temperature to the Doppler limit. The
physical origin of the correlation can be traced back to a cavity mediated
cross-friction, i.e. a friction force on one particle depending on the velocity

engineering these long range correlations. In addition this cross-friction

the completely positive maps (CPMs) that describe how the devices evolve the

everything she needs from `probability' without recourse to indeterminism,
ignorance, primitive identity over time or subjective uncertainty: all she
needs is a particular *rationality principle*.
  The decision-theoretic approach recently developed by Deutsch and Wallace
claims to provide just such a principle. But, according to Wallace, decision
theory is itself applicable only if the correct attitude to a future Everettian
measurement outcome is subjective uncertainty. I argue that subjective
uncertainty is not to be had, but I offer an alternative interpretation that
enables the Everettian to live without uncertainty: we can justify Everettian
decision theory on the basis that an Everettian should *care about* all her
future branches. The probabilities appearing in the decision-theoretic
representation theorem can then be interpreted as the degrees to which the
rational agent cares about each future branch. This reinterpretation, however,
reduces the intuitive plausibility of one of the Deutsch-Wallace axioms

the interrupted Oscillating Cantilever-driven Adiabatic Reversal (iOSCAR)

In this paper, we develop optimal detectors for several signal models that have

that two simple variants of the energy detector--the filtered energy detector

asymptotically optimal for the Discrete-Time (D-T) random telegraph signal
model assuming White Gaussian Noise (WGN). For the D-T random walk signal
model, the filtered energy detector performs close to the optimal Likelihood

creation during a naked-singularity formation in spherically symmetric
self-similar collapse without specifying the collapsing matter. In the generic
case, the power of particle emission is found to be proportional to the inverse
square of the remaining time to the Cauchy horizon (CH). The constant of
proportion can be arbitrarily large in the limit to marginally naked
singularity. Therefore, the unbounded power is especially striking in the case
that an event horizon is very close to the CH because the emitted energy can be
arbitrarily large in spite of a cutoff expected from quantum gravity. Above
results suggest the instability of the CH in spherically symmetric self-similar
spacetime from quantum field theory and seem to support the existence of a
semiclassical cosmic censor. The divergence of redshifts and blueshifts of
emitted particles is found to cause the divergence of power to positive or
negative infinity, depending on the coupling manner of scalar fields to
gravity. On the other hand, it is found that there is a special class of
self-similar spacetimes in which the semiclassical instability of the CH is not
efficient. The analyses in this paper are based on the geometric optics
approximation, which is justified in two dimensions but needs justification in
four dimensions.

an observable density (such as an energy density) which is classically
pointwise nonnegative may assume arbitrarily negative expectation values after
quantisation, even though the spatially integrated density remains nonnegative.
Two prominent examples which have previously been studied are the energy
density (in quantum field theory) and the probability flux of rightwards-moving
particles (in quantum mechanics). However, in the quantum field context, it has
been shown that the magnitude and space-time extension of negative energy
densities are not arbitrary, but restricted by relations which have come to be
known as `quantum inequalities'. In the present work, we explore the extent to
which such quantum inequalities hold for typical quantum mechanical systems. We
derive quantum inequalities of two types. The first are `kinematical' quantum
inequalities where spatially averaged densities are shown to be bounded below.
Such quantum inequalities are directly related to Garding inequalities. The
second type are `dynamical' quantum inequalities where one obtains bounds from
below on temporally averaged densities. We derive such quantum inequalities in
the case of the energy density in general quantum mechanical systems having
suitable decay properties on the negative spectral axis of the total energy.
Furthermore, we obtain explicit numerical values for the quantum inequalities
on the one-dimensional current density, using various spatial averaging weight
functions. We also improve the numerical value of the related `backflow
constant' previously investigated by Bracken and Melloy. In many cases our
numerical results are controlled by rigorous error estimates.

probabilistic interpretation while the evolution of the state is treated
deterministically. Here we show that one can also treat the evolution as being
probabilistic in nature and one can measure `which unitary' happened. Likewise,
one can give an information-theoretic interpretation to evolutions by defining
the entropy of a completely positive map. This entropy gives the rate at which
the informational content of the evolution can be compressed. One cannot
compress this information and still have the evolution act on an unknown state,
but we demonstrate a general scheme to do so probabilistically. This allows one
to generalize super-dense coding to the sending of quantum information. One can
also define the ``interaction-entanglement'' of a unitary, and concentrate this

bipartite quantum systems in pure joint states, from the assumption that they
should be not be affected by one party's action if the action can be undone by
the other party (``envariance of probability'') and an auxiliary assumption. We
argue that a natural generalization of the auxiliary assumption is actually
strong enough to yield the Born rule itself, but that Zurek's argument and
protocol can be adapted to do without this assumption, at the cost of using
envariance of probability in both directions. We consider alternative
motivations for envariance, one based on the no-signalling constraint that
actions on one subsystem of a quantum system not allow signalling to another
subsystem entirely distinct from the first, and another which is perhaps
strongest in the context of a relative-state interpretation of quantum
mechanics. In part because of this, we argue that the relative appeal of our
version and the original version of Zurek's argument depends in part upon

$n$-level subsystems, where $n$ is finite. Forming groups of $N$ subsystems
each, we show that the strength of interaction between the groups scales with
$N^{- 1/2}$. As a consequence, if the total system is in a thermal state with
inverse temperature $\beta$, a sufficient condition for subgroups of size $N$
to be approximately in a thermal state with the same temperature is $\sqrt{N}
\gg \beta \bar{\delta E}$, where $\bar{\delta E}$ is the width of the occupied

perturbation theory and the Hamiltonian adiabatic approach shows that both lead
to the Hannay angle; it is thus emphasised that this effect is already
contained in classical celestial mechanics, although not yet defined nor
evaluated separately. Secondly, a more general expression of the Hannay angle,
valid for an action-dependent potential is given; such a generalised expression
takes into account that the restricted three-body problem is a time-dependent,
two degrees of freedom problem even when restricted to the circular motion of
the test body. Consequently, (some of) the eccentricity terms cannot be
neglected {\it a priori}. Thirdly, we present a new numerical estimate for the
Earth adiabatically driven by Jupiter. We also point out errors in a previous

of the order of N_at^1/2 in a cloud of N_at cold atoms, which is an important

particularly promising from the point of view of integrability and flexibility
in the design. However decoherence is a serious limitation, due to the presence
of many types low energy excitations in the ``internal'' environment and of
``external'' sources due to the control circuitery. Here we study both kind of
dephasing in a special implementation, the charge Josephson qubit, however many
of our results are applicable to a large class of solid state qubits. This is
the case of 1/f noise for which we introduce and study a model of an
environment of bistable fluctuatiors. External sources of noise are analized in
terms of a suitable harmonic oscillator environment and the explicit mapping on
the spin boson model is presented. We perform a detailed investigation of
various computation procedures (single shot measurements, repeated
measurements) and discuss the problem of the information needed to characterize
the effect of the environment. For a fluctuator environment with 1/f spectrum
memory effects turn out to be important. Although in general information beyond
the power spectrum is needed, in many situations this results in the knowledge
of only one more microscopic parameter of the environment. This allows to
determine which degrees of freedom of the environment are effective sources of
decoherence in each different physical situation considered.

electron coherence (dephasing) in solids and in vacuum electron beam
interference. The vacuum fluctuations are modified by conductors and
dielectrics, as in the Casimir effect, and hence, bodies in the vicinity of the
beams can influence the beam coherence. We calculate the quenching of
interference of two beams moving in vacuum parallel to a thick plate with
permittivity $\epsilon(\omega)=\epsilon_{0}+i 4\pi\sigma/\omega$. In case of an
ideal conductor or dielectric $(|\epsilon|=\infty)$ the dephasing is suppressed
when the beams are close to the surface of the plate, because the random
tangential electric field $E_{t}$, responsible for dephasing, is zero at the
surface. The situation is changed dramatically when
 $\epsilon_{0}$ or $\sigma$ are finite. In this case there exists a layer near
the surface, where the fluctuations of $E_{t}$ are strong due to evanescent
near fields. The thickness of this near - field layer is of the order of the
wavelength in the dielectric or the skin depth in the conductor, corresponding
to a frequency which is the inverse electron time of flight from the emitter to
the detector. When the beams are within this layer their dephasing is enhanced
and for slow enough electrons can be even stronger than far from the surface.

the realignment method [K. Chen and L.A. Wu, Quant. Inf. Comput. 3, 193
(2003)]. The new separability criterion naturally generalizes the reduction
separability criterion introduced independently in previous work of [M.
Horodecki and P. Horodecki, Phys. Rev. A 59, 4206 (1999)] and [N.J. Cerf, C.
Adami and R.M. Gingrich, Phys. Rev. A 60, 898 (1999)]. In special cases, it
recovers the previous reduction criterion and the recent generalized partial
transposition criterion [K. Chen and L.A. Wu, Phys. Lett. A 306, 14 (2002)].
The criterion involves only simple matrix manipulations and can therefore be
easily applied.

  vapors</title><description>  The advantages of light and matter-wave Sagnac interferometers -- large area
on one hand and high rotational sensitivity per unit area on the other -- can
be combined utilizing ultra-slow light in cold atomic gases. While a
group-velocity reduction alone does not affect the Sagnac phase shift, the
associated momentum transfer from light to atoms generates a coherent
matter-wave component which gives rise to a substantially enhanced rotational
signal. It is shown that matter-wave sensitivity in a large-area interferometer

Already a noticeable enhancement of the Sagnac phase shift is possible however
with much less cooling requirements.

  Rates</title><description>  The tolerable erasure error rate for scalable quantum computation is shown to
be at least 0.292, given standard scalability assumptions. This bound is
obtained by implementing computations with generic stabilizer code
teleportation steps that combine the necessary operations with error
correction. An interesting consequence of the technique is that the only errors
that affect the maximum tolerable error rate are storage and Bell measurement
errors. If storage errors are negligible, then any detected Bell measurement
error below 1/2 is permissible. Another consequence of the technique is that
the maximum tolerable depolarizing error rate is dominated by how well one can
prepare the required encoded states. For example, if storage and Bell
measurement errors are relatively small, then independent depolarizing errors
with error rate close to 0.1 per qubit are tolerable in the prepared states.
The implementation overhead is dominated by the efficiency with which the
required encoded states can be prepared. At present, this efficiency is very
low, particularly for error rates close to the maximum tolerable ones.

N-qubit Hilbert space. When considered as the vertices of a geometrical figure,
the resulting states form the equivalent of a Platonic solid. The
discretization technique inherently describes a class of pi/2 rotations that
connect neighboring states in the set, i.e. that leave the geometrical figures
invariant. These rotations are shown to generate the Clifford group, a general
group of discrete transformations on N qubits. Discretizing the N-qubit Hilbert
space allows us to define its digital quantum information content, and we show
that this information content grows as N^2. While we believe the discrete sets
are interesting because they allow extra-classical behavior--such as quantum
entanglement and quantum parallelism--to be explored while circumventing the
continuity of Hilbert space, we also show how they may be a useful tool for

been demonstrated in numerous realizations of Young's classical double-slit
interference experiment and its analogues. However, quantum entanglement - a
significant coherent superposition in multiparticle systems - yields phenomena
that are much richer and more interesting than anything that can be seen in a
one-particle system. Among them, one important type of multi-particle
experiments uses path-entangled number-states, which exhibit pure higher-order
interference and allow novel applications in metrology and imaging such as
quantum interferometry and spectroscopy with phase sensitivity at the
Heisenberg limit or quantum lithography beyond the classical diffraction limit.
Up to now, in optical implementations of such schemes lower-order interference
effects would always decrease the overall performance at higher particle
numbers. They have thus been limited to two photons. We overcome this
limitation and demonstrate a linear-optics-based four-photon interferometer.
Observation of a four-particle mode-entangled state is confirmed by
interference fringes with a periodicity of one quarter of the single-photon
wavelength. This scheme can readily be extended to arbitrary photon numbers and
thus represents an important step towards realizable applications with
entanglement-enhanced performance.

aim of the paper is to show that, changing the quantization axis with respect
to the common usage, it is possible to prove a general result either for N or
the coupling constant going to infinity for the exact solution of the model.
This completes the analysis, known in the current literature, with respect to
the same model in the limit of N and volume going to infinity, keeping the
density constant. For the latter the proper axis of quantization is given by
the Hamiltonian of the two-level atoms and for the former the proper axis of
quantization is defined by the interaction. The relevance of this result relies
on the observation that a general measurement apparatus acts using
electromagnetic interaction and so, one can states that the thermodynamic limit
is enough to grant the appearance of classical effects. Indeed, recent
experimental results give first evidence that superposition states disappear
interacting with an electromagnetic field having a large number of photons.

the resonance amplification of radiation. The production of photons is a purely
quantum effect described in terms of quantum anomalies in recursive formulas.
The resonance enhancement is a classical phenomenon of focusing and amplifying
beams of photons due to D\&quot;{o}ppler effect.

Assume that density matrices D_1 and D_2 acting on H are given. In the paper
the consequences of the existence of a coarse-graining S from B(K) to B(H)
satisfying ST(D_1)=D_1 and ST(D_2)=D_2 are given. (This condition means the
sufficiency of T for D_1 and D_2.) Sufficiency implies a particular

means to understand the nature of quantum algorithmic speedups. Since quantum
gates that do not preserve the computational basis are necessary for achieving
quantum speedups, it appears natural to define the quantumness of a quantum
circuit using the number of such gates. Intuitively, a reduction in the
quantumness requires an increase in the amount of classical computation, hence
giving a ``quantum and classical tradeoff''.
  In this paper we present two results on this direction. The first gives an
asymptotic answer to the question: ``what is the minimum number of
non-basis-preserving gates required to generate a good approximation to a given
state''. This question is the quantum analogy of the following classical
question, ``how many fair coins are needed to generate a given probability
distribution'', which was studied and resolved by Knuth and Yao in 1976. Our
second result shows that any quantum algorithm that solves Grover's Problem of
size n using k queries and l levels of non-basis-preserving gates must have
k*l=\Omega(n).

related picture of ideal gas of q-bosons enables to effectively describe the
observed non-Bose type behaviour, in experiments on heavy-ion collisions, of
the intercept (or the &quot;strength&quot;) $\lambda$ of the two-particle correlation
function of identical pions or kaons. In this paper we extend main results of
that approach in the two aspects: first, we derive in explicit form the
intercepts of n-particle correlation functions in the case of q-Bose gas model
and, second, provide their explicit two-parameter (or qp-) generalization.

of K\&quot;ahler spaces (with conic singularities), connected with two-dimensional
complex projective spaces. Its energy spectrum is nondegenerate in the orbital
quantum number, when the space has non-constant curvature. We reduce the model
to a three-dimensional system interacting with the Dirac monopole. Owing to
noncommutativity of the reduction and quantization procedures, the Hamiltonian
of the reduced system gets non-trivial quantum corrections. We transform the
reduced system into a MIC-Kepler-like one and find that quantum corrections
arise only in its energy and coupling constant. We present the exact spectrum
of the generalized MIC-Kepler system. The one-(complex) dimensional analog of
the suggested model is formulated on the Riemann surface over the complex
projective plane and could be interpreted as a system with fractional spin.

different modulus parameters, were first obtained over two hundred years ago by
changing integration variables in elliptic integrals.We rediscover known
results as well as obtain more generalized Landen formulas from a very
different perspective, by making use of the recently obtained periodic
solutions of physically interesting nonlinear differential equations and
numerous remarkable new cyclic identities involving Jacobi elliptic functions.
We find that several of our Landen transformations have a rather different and
substantially more elegant appearance compared to the forms usually found in
the literature. Further, by making use of the cyclic identities discovered
recently, we also obtain some entirely new sets of Landen transformations. This
paper is an expanded and revised version of our previous paper math-ph/0204054.

a nearly perfect purification implies a nearly perfect sharing of multipartite

the resolution of this difficulty, we come back to the derivation of the force
from basic principles of the quantum theory of lossy optical cavities. We
obtain an expression which is valid for arbitrary mirrors, including
dissipative ones, characterized by frequency dependent reflection amplitudes.

sequence of elementary gates, such as controlled-not gates and single qubit
gates. We prove that the simplified Toffoli gate by Margolus, which coincides
with the Toffoli gate up to a single change of sign, cannot be realized with
less than three controlled-not gates. If the circuit is implemented with three
controlled-not gates, then at least four additional single qubit gates are
necessary. This proves that the implementation suggested by Margolus is
optimal.

  polarization optics</title><description>  Knill, Laflamme, and Milburn (KLM) proved that it is possible to build a
scalable universal quantum computer using only linear-optics elements and
conditional dynamics [Nature (London) {\bf 409}, 46 (2001)\cite{Knill}].
However, the practical realization of the quantum logic gate for the scheme is
still technically difficult. A major difficulty is the requirement for
sub-wavelength level stabilization of the interlocking interferometers.
Following our recent experimental work[Phys. Rev. Lett.{\bf 92}, 017902
(2004)\cite{Sanaka2}], we describe a more feasible scheme to implement the gate
that greatly reduces the experimental stability requirements. The scheme uses
only polarizing beam splitters and half-wave plates.

dipole traps where the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic. A perturbative
expression derived for the coherence of the echo scheme of [Andersen et. al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 023001 (2003)] shows it is a function of the survival
probability or fidelity of eigenstates of the motion of the atoms in the trap.
The echo coherence and the survival probability display &quot;system specific&quot;
features, even when the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic. In
particular, partial revivals in the echo signal and the survival probability
are found for a small shift of the potential. Next, a &quot;semi-classical&quot;
expression for the averaged echo signal is presented and used to calculate the
echo signal for atoms in a light sheet wedge billiard. Revivals in the echo
coherence are found in this system, indicating they may be a generic feature of
dipole traps.

by the physical requirement of completely positive evolution for open N-level
systems. The Lindblad operators that govern the evolution of the system are
expressed in terms of observable relaxation rates, explicit formulas for the
decoherence rates due to population relaxation are derived, and it is shown
that there are additional, non-trivial constraints on the pure dephasing rates

  Inefficient Photon Detection</title><description>  It is shown that a linear superposition of two macroscopically
distinguishable optical coherent states can be generated using a single photon
source and simple all-optical operations. Weak squeezing on a single photon,
beam mixing with an auxiliary coherent state, and photon detecting with
imperfect threshold detectors are enough to generate a coherent state
superposition in a free propagating optical field with a large coherent
amplitude ($\alpha&gt;2$) and high fidelity ($F&gt;0.99$). In contrast to all
previous schemes to generate such a state, our scheme does not need photon
number resolving measurements nor Kerr-type nonlinear interactions.
Furthermore, it is robust to detection inefficiency and exhibits some
resilience to photon production inefficiency.
