states. Nonetheless, the capability to distinguish nonorthogonal states
unambiguously is an important primitive in quantum information processing. In
this work, we experimentally implement generalized measurements in an optical
system and demonstrate the first optimal unambiguous discrimination between
three nonorthogonal states, with a success rate of 55%, to be compared with the
25% maximum achievable using projective measurements. Furthermore we present
the first realization of unambiguous discrimination between a pure state and a
nonorthogonal mixed state.

  sampling assumption</title><description>  A simple local hidden-variables model is exhibited which reproduces the
results of all performed tests of Bell\'{}s inequalities involving optical
photon pairs. For the old atomic-cascade experiments, like Aspect\'{}s, the
model agrees with quantum mechanics even for ideal set-ups. For more recent
experiments, using parametric down-converted photons, the agreement occurs only
for actual experiments, involving low efficiency detectors. Arguments are given
against the fair sampling assumption, currently combined with the results of
the experiments in order to claim a contradiction with local realism. New tests
are proposed which are able to discriminate between quantum mechanics and a
restricted, but appealing, family of local hidden-variables models. Such tests
require detectors with efficiencies just above 20%.

which implies the modification of mathematical expressions for some postulates
of quantum mechanics. In particular we have a Hilbert space where the vectors
are complex functions of discrete variable. As a concrete example we develop a
discrete analog of the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator, using the
dependence of the Wigner functions in terms of Kravchuk polynomials. In this
model the position operator has a discrete spectrum given by one index of the
Wigner functions, in the same way that the energy eigenvalues are given by the
other matricial index. Similar picture can be made for other models where the
differential equation and their solutions correspond to the continuous limit of
some difference operator and orthogonal polynomial of discrete variable.

perfectly if it is necessary. That the final states of environment are
completely determined by the initial states of the system allows that an easure
operation can be realized by a swap operation between system and an ancilla.
Therefore, the erased information can be recoverd. When there is an
irreversible process, e.g. an irreversible operation or a decoherence process,
in the erasure process, the information would be erased perpetually. We present
that quantum erasure will also give heat dissipation in environment. And a
classical limit of quantum erasure is given which coincides with Landauer's
erasure principle.

Operators with discrete spectra are incorporated into Bohmian mechanics by

Bohmian mechanics can handle the creation and annihilation of particles.

universal test for the cryptographic one-wayness of functions (or permutations)

equivalent to that of cryptographic one-way functions. In the quantum

complete a necessary and sufficient for quantum one-way permutations. The
necessary and sufficient condition can be regarded as a universal test for
quantum one-way permutations, since the condition is described as a collection

  quantum mechanics?</title><description>  Einstein's unpublished 1927 deterministic trajectory interpretation of
quantum mechanics is critically examined, in particular with regard to the
reason given by Einstein for rejecting his theory. It is shown that the aspect
Einstein found objectionable - the mutual dependence of the motions of
particles when the (many-body) wavefunction factorises - is a generic attribute
of his theory but that this feature may be removed by modifying Einstein's
method in either of two ways: using a suggestion of Grommer or, in a physically
important special case, using a simpler technique. It is emphasized though that
the presence or absence of the interdependence property does not determine the
acceptability of a trajectory theory. It is shown that there are other grounds
for rejecting Einstein's theory (and the two modified theories), to do with its
domain of applicability and compatibility with empirical predictions. That
Einstein's reason for rejection is not a priori grounds for discarding a
trajectory theory is demonstrated by reference to an alternative deterministic
trajectory theory that displays similar particle interdependence yet is
compatible with quantum predictions.

of the phenomenon of wave packet revivals in quantum systems has flourished
over the last decade and a half. Quantum revivals are characterized by
initially localized quantum states which have a short-term, quasi-classical
time evolution, which then can spread significantly over several orbits, only
to reform later in the form of a quantum revival in which the spreading
reverses itself, the wave packet relocalizes, and the semi-classical
periodicity is once again evident. Relocalization of the initial wave packet
into a number of smaller copies of the initial packet (`minipackets' or
`clones') is also possible, giving rise to fractional revivals. Systems
exhibiting such behavior are a fundamental realization of time-dependent
interference phenomena for bound states with quantized energies in quantum
mechanics and are therefore of wide interest in the physics and chemistry
communities.
  We review the theoretical machinery of quantum wave packet construction
leading to the existence of revivals and fractional revivals, in systems with
one (or more) quantum number(s), as well as discussing how information on the
classical period and revival time is encoded in the energy eigenvalue spectrum.
We discuss a number of one-dimensional model systems which exhibit revival
behavior, including the infinite well, the quantum bouncer, and others, as well
as several two-dimensional integrable quantum billiard systems. Finally, we
briefly review the experimental evidence for wave packet revivals in atomic,
molecular, and other systems, and related revival phenomena in condensed matter

survive environment-induced decoherence, and be observed for times much larger

there are two different deformations of classical phase-space: complex Hilbert

we use the calculus over the hyperbolic algebra similar to functional
superanalysis of Vladimirov-Volovich. Ordinary (complex) and hyperbolic quantum

jump statistics of three atoms. This is done for three-level systems in a V
configuration and in what may be called a D configuration. The transition rates
between the four different intensity periods are calculated in closed form.
Cooperative effects are shown to increase by a factor of 2 compared to two of
either three-level systems. This results in transition rates that are, for
distances of about one wavelength of the strong transition, up to 100% higher
than for independent systems. In addition the double and triple jump rates are
calculated from the transition rates. In this case cooperative effects of up to
170% for distances of about one wavelength and still up to 15% around 10
wavelengths are found. Nevertheless, for the parameters of an experiment with
Hg+ ions the effects are negligible, in agreement with the experimental data.
For three Ba+ ions this seems to indicate that the large cooperative effects
observed experimentally cannot be explained by the dipole-dipole interaction.

questions about the physical state of a system that are answered must always be
equal to the number that are unanswered in a state of maximal knowledge. A wide
variety of quantum phenomena are found to have analogues within this toy
theory. Such phenomena include: the noncommutativity of measurements,
interference, the multiplicity of convex decompositions of a mixed state, the
impossibility of discriminating nonorthogonal states, the impossibility of a
universal state inverter, the distinction between bi-partite and tri-partite
entanglement, the monogamy of pure entanglement, no cloning, no broadcasting,
remote steering, teleportation, dense coding, mutually unbiased bases, and many

the view that quantum states are states of incomplete knowledge rather than

algorithms of Grover \cite{g} and Ambainis \cite{amb03} and interpret them as
quantum walks with memory. We compare the performance of walk based classical
and quantum algorithms and show that the latter run much quicker in general.
Let $P$ be a symmetric Markov chain with transition probabilities $P[i,j]$, $(i
,j\in [n])$. Some elements of the state space are marked. We are promised that
the set of marked elements has size either zero or at least $\epsilon n$. The
goal is to find out with great certainty which of the above two cases holds.
Our model is a black box that can answer certain yes/no questions and can
generate random elements picked from certain distributions. More specifically,
by request the black box can give us a uniformly distributed random element for
the cost of $\wp_{0}$. Also, when ``inserting'' an element $i$ into the black
box we can obtain a random element $j$, where $j$ is distributed according to
$P[i,j]$. The cost of the latter operation is $\wp_{1}$. Finally, we can use
the black box to test if an element $i$ is marked, and this costs us $\wp_{2}$.
If $\delta$ is the eigenvalue gap of $P$, there is a simple classical algorithm
with cost $O(\wp_{0} + (\wp_{1}+\wp_{2})/\delta\epsilon)$ that solves the above
promise problem. (The algorithm is efficient if $\wp_{0}$ is much larger than
$\wp_{1}+\wp_{2}$.) In contrast,we show that for the ``quantized'' version of
the algorithm it costs only $O(\wp_{0} +
(\wp_{1}+\wp_{2})/\sqrt{\delta\epsilon})$ to solve the problem. We refer to
this as the $\sqrt{\delta\epsilon}$ rule. Among the technical contributions we
give a formula for the spectrum of the product of two general reflections.

Dueck via general quantum channels, extending investigations for classical
channels, initial work for classical-quantum (cq) channels and &quot;quantum
fingerprinting&quot;.
 We show that the identification capacity of a discrete memoryless quantum
channel for classical information can be larger than that for transmission;
this is in contrast to all previously considered models, where it turns out to
equal the common randomness capacity (equals transmission capacity in our
case): in particular, for a noiseless qubit, we show the identification
capacity to be 2, while transmission and common randomness capacity are 1.
 Then we turn to a natural concept of identification of quantum messages (i.e.
a notion of &quot;fingerprint&quot; for quantum states). This is much closer to quantum
information transmission than its classical counterpart (for one thing, the
code length grows only exponentially, compared to double exponentially for
classical identification). Indeed, we show how the problem exhibits a nice
connection to visible quantum coding. Astonishingly, for the noiseless qubit
channel this capacity turns out to be 2: in other words, one can compress two
qubits into one and this is optimal. In general however, we conjecture quantum
identification capacity to be different from classical identification capacity.

Heisenberg chain in which the interactions are 'always on', provided that one
can abruptly tune the Zeeman energies of the individual (pseudo-)spins. Here we
provide a more complete analysis of this scheme, including several
generalizations. We generalize the interaction to an anisotropic form
(incorporating the XY, or Forster, interaction as a limit), providing a proof
that a chain coupled in this fashion tends to an effective Ising chain in the
limit of far off-resonant spins. We derive the primitive two-qubit gate that
results from exploiting abrupt Zeeman tuning with such an interaction. We also
demonstrate, via numerical simulation, that the same basic scheme functions in
the case of smoothly shifted Zeeman energies. We conclude with some remarks
regarding generalisations to two- and three-dimensional arrays.

with $\delta$-function potentials in 1+1 and 3+1 dimensions are calculated. For
parallel plane surfaces, the results are finite, coincide with the pressures
associated with Dirichlet planes in the limit of strong coupling, and for weak
coupling do not possess a power-series expansion in 1+1 dimension. The relation
between Casimir energies and Casimir pressures is clarified,and the former are
shown to involve surface terms. The Casimir energy for a $\delta$-function
spherical shell in 3+1 dimensions has an expression that reduces to the
familiar result for a Dirichlet shell in the strong-coupling limit. However,
the Casimir energy for finite coupling possesses a logarithmic divergence first
appearing in third order in the weak-coupling expansion, which seems
unremovable. The corresponding energies and pressures for a derivative of a
$\delta$-function potential for the same spherical geometry generalizes the TM
contributions of electrodynamics. Cancellation of divergences can occur between
the TE ($\delta$-function) and TM (derivative of $\delta$-function) Casimir
energies. These results clarify recent discussions in the literature.

problem of quantum state and parameter estimation by continuous monitoring of
an open quantum system. Specifically, we have reexamined the system of a
two-level atom with an unknown Rabi frequency introduced by Gambetta and
Wiseman [Phys. Rev. A 64, 042105 (2001)]. We consider only direct
photodetection and use the realistic quantum trajectory theory reported by
Warszawski, Wiseman, and Mabuchi [Phys. Rev. A 65, 023802 (2002)]. The most
significant effect comes from a finite bandwidth, corresponding to an
uncertainty in the response time of the photodiode. Unless the bandwidth is
significantly greater than the Rabi frequency, the observer's ability to obtain
information about the unknown Rabi frequency, and about the state of the atom,
is severely compromised. This result has implications for quantum control in
the presence of unknown parameters for realistic detectors, and even for ideal
detectors, as it implies that most of the information in the measurement record
is contained in the precise timing of the detections.

considered. We identify a measure of decoherence, derived from the density
matrix of the system of interest, that quantifies the environmentally induced
error, i.e., deviation from the ideal isolated-system dynamics. This measure
can be shown to have several useful features. Its behavior as a function of
time has no dependence on the initial conditions, and is expected to be
insensitive to the internal dynamical time scales of the system, thus only
probing the decoherence-related time dependence. For a spin-boson model - a
prototype of a qubit interacting with environment - we also demonstrate the
property of additivity: in the regime of the onset of decoherence, the sum of
the individual qubit error measures provides an estimate of the error for a
several-qubit system, even if the qubits are entangled, as expected in
quantum-computing applications. This makes it possible to estimate decoherence
for several-qubits quantum computer gate designs for which explicit
calculations are exceedingly difficult.

1948 when Casimir calculated the force of attraction between parallel uncharged
plates, a phenomenon confirmed experimentally with ever increasing precision.
Casimir himself suggested that a similar attractive self-stress existed for a
conducting spherical shell, but Boyer obtained a repulsive stress. Other
geometries and higher dimensions have been considered over the years. Local
effects, and divergences associated with surfaces and edges have been
investigated by several authors. Quite recently, Graham et al. have re-examined
such calculations, using conventional techniques of perturbative quantum field
theory to remove divergences, and have suggested that previous self-stress
results may be suspect. Here we show that most of the examples considered in
their work are misleading; in particular, it is well-known that in two
dimensions a circular boundary has a divergence in the Casimir energy for
massless fields, while for general dimension $D$ not equal to an even integer
the corresponding Casimir energy arising from massless fields interior and
exterior to a hyperspherical shell is finite. It has also long been recognized
that the Casimir energy for massive fields is divergent for curved boundaries.
These conclusions are reinforced by a calculation of the relevant leading
Feynman diagram in $D$ dimensions. Divergences do occur in third order, as has
been recognized for many years, but this logarithmic divergence is of
questionable relevance to real shells.

distance or large time limit. In the short distance or short time limit an
additional deviation from perfect alignment occurs due to the uncertainty of
the location of the source. This error contribution plays a major role in
Popper's orginal experimental proposal. Peres' statement applies rather to the
phenomenon of optical imaging, which was regarded by him as a verification of
his statement. This is because this experiment can in a certain sense be seen
as occurring in the large distance limit. We will also reconsider both
experiments from the viewpoint of Bohmian mechanics. In Bohmian mechanics
particles with exactly opposite momenta will move in opposite directions. In
addition it will prove particularly usefull to use Bohmian mechanics because
the Bohmian trajectories coincide with the conceptual trajectories drawn by

decaying states, belonging to a complex spectral representation of the

the real parts give the average energy of the collective states. In one
dimension there is strong interference between the fields emitted by the atoms,
leading to long-range cooperative effects. The decay rates and the energy
oscillate with the distance $x_{21}$. Depending on $x_{21}$, the decay rates
will either decrease, vanish or increase as compared with the one-atom decay
rate. We have sub- and super-radiance at periodic intervals. Our model may be

  Threshold for a Toric Quantum Memory</title><description>  We study the phase structure of the random-plaquette Z_2 lattice gauge model
in three dimensions. In this model, the &quot;gauge coupling&quot; for each plaquette is
a quenched random variable that takes the value \beta with the probability 1-p
and -\beta with the probability p. This model is relevant for the recently
proposed quantum memory of toric code. The parameter p is the concentration of
the plaquettes with &quot;wrong-sign&quot; couplings -\beta, and interpreted as the error
probability per qubit in quantum code. In the gauge system with p=0, i.e., with
the uniform gauge couplings \beta, it is known that there exists a second-order
phase transition at a certain critical &quot;temperature&quot;, T(\equiv \beta^{-1}) =
T_c =1.31, which separates an ordered(Higgs) phase at T&lt;T_c and a
disordered(confinement) phase at T&gt;T_c. As p increases, the critical
temperature T_c(p) decreases. In the p-T plane, the curve T_c(p) intersects
with the Nishimori line T_{N}(p) at the certain point (p_c, T_{N}(p_c)). The
value p_c is just the accuracy threshold for a fault-tolerant quantum memory
and associated quantum computations. By the Monte-Carlo simulations, we
calculate the specific heat and the expectation values of the Wilson loop to
obtain the phase-transition line T_c(p) numerically. The accuracy threshold is
estimated as p_c \simeq 0.033.

positivity decoherence condition of Goldstein and Page. A quantum theory of
closed systems requires two elements; 1) a condition specifying which sets of
histories may be assigned probabilities that are consistent with the rules of
probability theory, and 2) a rule for those probabilities. The linear
positivity condition of Goldstein and Page is the weakest of the general
conditions proposed so far. Its general properties relating to exact
probability sum rules, time-neutrality, and conservation laws are explored. Its
inconsistency with the usual notion of independent subsystems in quantum
mechanics is reviewed. Its relation to the stronger condition of medium
decoherence necessary for classicality is discussed. The linear positivity of
histories in a number of simple model systems is investigated with the aim of
exhibiting linearly positive sets of histories that are not decoherent. The
utility of extending the notion of probability to include values outside the
range of 0 to 1 is described. Alternatives with such virtual probabilities
cannot be measured or recorded, but can be used in the intermediate steps of
calculating real probabilities. Virtual probabilities give a simple and general
way of formulating quantum theory.

interacting fermions in the light of strength functions and their participation
ratio and information entropy. For weakly interacting fermions in a mean-field
with random two-body interactions of increasing strength $\lambda$, the
strength functions $F_k(E)$ are well known to change, in the regime where level
fluctuations follow Wigner's surmise, from Breit-Wigner to Gaussian form. We
propose an ansatz for the function describing this transition which we use to
investigate the participation ratio $\xi_2$ and the information entropy $S^{\rm
info}$ during this crossover, thereby extending the known behavior valid in the
Gaussian domain into much of the Breit-Wigner domain. Our method also allows us
to derive the scaling law for the duality point $\lambda = \lambda_d$, where
$F_k(E)$, $\xi_2$ and $S^{\rm info}$ in both the weak ($\lambda=0$) and strong
mixing ($\lambda = \infty$) basis coincide as $\lambda_d \sim 1/\sqrt{m}$,
where $m$ is the number of fermions. As an application, the ansatz function for
strength functions is used in describing the Breit-Wigner to Gaussian

  Materials</title><description>  The distribution of resistance fluctuations of conducting thin films with
granular structure near electrical breakdown is studied by numerical
simulations. The film is modeled as a resistor network in a steady state
determined by the competition between two biased processes, breaking and
recovery. Systems of different sizes and with different levels of internal
disorder are considered. Sharp deviations from a Gaussian distribution are
found near breakdown and the effect increases with the degree of internal
disorder. However, we show that in general this non-Gaussianity is related to
the finite size of the system and vanishes in the large size limit.
Nevertheless, near the critical point of the conductor-insulator transition,
deviations from Gaussianity persist when the size is increased and the
distribution of resistance fluctuations is well fitted by the universal
Bramwell-Holdsworth-Pinton distribution.

warm. Existing spin-cooling techniques are highly limited in their efficiency
and usefulness. Algorithmic cooling is a promising new spin-cooling approach
that employs data compression methods in open systems. It reduces the entropy
of spins on long molecules to a point far beyond Shannon's bound on reversible
entropy manipulations (an information-theoretic version of the 2nd Law of
Thermodynamics), thus increasing their polarization. Here we present an
efficient and experimentally feasible algorithmic cooling technique that cools
spins to very low temperatures even on short molecules. This practicable
algorithmic cooling could lead to breakthroughs in high-sensitivity NMR
spectroscopy in the near future, and to the development of scalable NMR quantum
computers in the far future. Moreover, while the cooling algorithm itself is
classical, it uses quantum gates in its implementation, thus representing the
first short-term application of quantum computing devices.

confirmed, i.e. the third law of thermodynamics (the Nernst heat theorem) is

Different representations for the impedances, which are equivalent for real

geometrical shape of the interacting objects. We study the effect of strong
periodic shape deformations of two ideal metal plates on their quantum
interaction. A non-perturbative approach which is based on a path integral
quantization of the electromagnetic field is presented in detail. Using this
approach, we compute the force for the specific case of a flat plate and a
plate with a rectangular corrugation. We obtain complementary analytical and
numerical results which allow us to identify two different scaling regimes for
the force as a function of the mean plate distance, corrugation amplitude and
wave length. Qualitative distinctions between transversal electric and magnetic
modes are revealed. Our results demonstrate the importance of a careful
consideration of the non-additivity of Casimir forces, especially in strongly
non-planar geometries. Non-perturbative effects due to surface edges are found.
Strong deviations from the commonly used proximity force approximation emerge
over a wide range of corrugation wave lengths, even though the surface is
composed only of flat segments. We compare our results to that of a

equal to 8.5 pN at 95% confidence. In terms of the relative errors,
experimental precision of 1.75% is obtained at the shortest separation of 62 nm
at 95% confidence level (at 60% confidence the experimental precision of 1% is
confirmed at the shortest separation). An independent determination of the
accuracy of the theoretical calculations of the Casimir force and its
application to the experimental configuration is carefully made. Special
attention is paid to the sample-dependent variations of the optical tabulated
data due to the presence of grains, contribution of surface plasmons, and
errors introduced by the use of the proximity force theorem. Nonmultiplicative
and diffraction-type contributions to the surface roughness corrections are
examined. The electric forces due to patch potentials resulting from the
polycrystalline nature of the gold films are estimated. The finite size and
thermal effects are found to be negligible. The theoretical accuracy of about
1.69% and 1.1% are found at a separation 62 nm and 200 nm, respectively. Within
the limits of experimental and theoretical errors very good agreement between

  Modes</title><description>  Motivated by the recent interest in quantization of black hole area spectrum,
we consider the area spectrum of Kerr and extremal Kerr black holes. Based on
the proposal by Bekenstein and others that the black hole area spectrum is
discrete and equally spaced, we implement Kunstatter's method to derive the
area spectrum for the Kerr and extremal Kerr black holes. The real part of the
quasinormal frequencies of Kerr black hole used for this computation is of the
form $m\Omega$ where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the black hole
horizon. The resulting spectrum is discrete but not as expected uniformly
spaced. Thus, we infer that the function describing the real part of
quasinormal frequencies of Kerr black hole is not the correct one. This
conclusion is in agreement with the numerical results for the highly damped
quasinormal modes of Kerr black hole recently presented by Berti, Cardoso and
Yoshida. On the contrary, extremal Kerr black hole is shown to have a discrete
area spectrum which in addition is evenly spaced. The area spacing derived in
our analysis for the extremal Kerr black hole area spectrum is not proportional
to $\ln 3$. Therefore, it does not give support to Hod's statement that the
area spectrum $A_{n}=(4l^{2}_{p}ln 3)n$ should be valid for a generic
Kerr-Newman black hole.

information-theoretic arguments. The nonlinearities are controlled by an
intrinsic length scale and involve derivatives to all orders thus making the
equation mildly nonlocal. The nonlinear equation is homogeneous, separable,
conserves probability, but is not invariant under spacetime symmetries.
Spacetime symmetries are recovered when a dimensionless parameter is tuned to
vanish, whereby linearity is simultaneously established and the length scale
becomes hidden. It is thus suggested that if, in the search for a more basic
foundation for Nature's Laws, an inference principle is given precedence over
symmetry requirements, then the symmetries of spacetime and the linearity of
quantum theory might both be emergent properties that are intrinsically linked.
Supporting arguments are provided for this point of view and some testable
phenomenological consequences highlighted. The generalised Klien-Gordon and
Dirac equations are also studied, leading to the suggestion that nonlinear
quantum dynamics with intrinsically broken spacetime symmetries might be
relevant to understanding the problem of neutrino mass(lessness) and

a hidden discrete family symmetry in the Standard Model of particle physics.

and quantum mechanics simultaneously through the representation theory of the
Heisenberg group. In this paper we describe how non-linear canonical
transformations affect $p$-mechanical observables and states. Using this we
show how canonical transformations change a quantum mechanical system. We seek
an operator on the set of $p$-mechanical observables which corresponds to the
classical canonical transformation. In order to do this we derive a set of
integral equations which when solved will give us the coherent state expansion
of this operator. The motivation for these integral equations comes from the
work of Moshinsky and a variety of collaborators. We consider a number of
examples and discuss the use of these equations for non-bijective
transformations.

counter examples are discussed, showing that the minimum work principle can be
violated and that optimal processes are neither adiabatically slow nor

the black hole in general microcanonical and canonical area ensembles for these

statistical quantities for any spectrum can be reproduced by a heuristic
picture of Bekenstein up to second order. For one of these spectra - the
equally-spaced spectrum - in light of a proposed connection of the black hole
area spectrum to the quasinormal mode spectrum and following hep-th/0304135, we
present explicit calculations to argue that this spectrum is completely
consistent with this connection. This follows without requiring a change in the
gauge group of the spin degrees of freedom in this formalism from SU(2) to
SO(3). We also show that independent of the area spectrum, the degeneracy of
the area observable is bounded by $C A\exp(A/4)$, where $A$ is measured in
Planck units and $C$ is a constant of order unity.

two-qubit operator'' has been conclusively answered -- three are necessary and
sufficient -- previous work on this topic assumes that one wants to simulate a
given unitary operator up to global phase. However, in many practical cases
additional degrees of freedom are allowed. For example, if the computation is
to be followed by a given projective measurement, many dissimilar operators
achieve the same output distributions on all input states. Alternatively, if it
is known that the input state is |0&gt;, the action of the given operator on all
orthogonal states is immaterial. In such cases, we say that the unitary
operator is incompletely specified; in this work, we take up the practical
challenge of satisfying a given specification with the smallest possible
circuit. In particular, we identify cases in which such operators can be
implemented using fewer quantum gates than are required for generic completely
specified operators.

the energies of the BPS-saturating states. These findings thus provide a more

pure state trajectories generated by a non-Markovian stochastic (diffusive)
Schr\&quot;odinger equation, as introduced by Di\'osi, Gisin, and Strunz. Recently
we have shown that such equations can be derived using the modal (hidden
variable) interpretation of quantum mechanics. In this paper we generalize this
theory to treat jump-like unravelings. To illustrate the jump-like behavior we
consider a simple system: A classically driven (at Rabi frequency $\Omega$)
two-level atom coupled linearly to a three mode optical bath, with a central
frequency equal to the frequency of the atom, $\omega_0$, and the two side
bands have frequencies $\omega_0\pm\Omega$. In the large $\Omega$ limit we
observed that the jump-like behavior is similar to that observed in this system
with a Markovian (broad band) bath. This is expected as in the Markovian limit
the fluorescence spectrum for a strongly driven two level atom takes the form
of a Mollow triplet. However the length of time for which the Markovian-like
behaviour persists depends upon {\em which} jump-like unraveling is used.

work, while correlations may increase or reduce the ergotropy.

classical prejudices, including the belief that space and time are
intrinsically and infinitely differentiated. They compel him to relativize the
concept of objective existence in two ways. The elimination of these prejudices
makes it possible to recognize the quantum formalism's ontological implications
- the relative and contingent reality of spatiotemporal distinctions and the
extrinsic and finite spatiotemporal differentiation of the physical world -
which in turn makes it possible to arrive at an unqualified objective
existence. Contrary to a widespread misconception, viewing the quantum
formalism as being fundamentally a probability algorithm does not imply that
quantum mechanics is concerned with states of knowledge rather than states of
Nature. On the contrary, it makes possible a complete and strongly objective
description of the physical world that requires no reference to observers. What
objectively exists, in a sense that requires no qualification, is the
trajectories of macroscopic objects, whose fuzziness is empirically irrelevant,
the properties and values of whose possession these trajectories provide
indelible records, and the fuzzy and temporally undifferentiated states of
affairs that obtain between measurements and are described by counterfactual
probability assignments.

quantum states are somehow associated with probabilities and then prove that
these probabilities are given by Born's rule. One has to show how irreducible
probabilities can arise in the context of an ontological no-collapse
interpretation of quantum states. It is argued that the reason why all attempts
to do this have so far failed is that quantum states are fundamentally
algorithms for computing correlations between possible measurement outcomes,
rather than evolving ontological states.

construct quantum theories of non-standard models for space, or space-time. The
starting point is the observation that entities of this type can typically be
regarded as objects in a category whose arrows are structure-preserving maps.
This motivates investigating the general problem of quantising a system whose
`configuration space' (or history-theory analogue) is the set of objects
$\Ob\Q$ in a category $\Q$.
  We develop a scheme based on constructing an analogue of the group that is
used in the canonical quantisation of a system whose configuration space is a
manifold $Q\simeq G/H$, where $G$ and $H$ are Lie groups. In particular, we
choose as the analogue of $G$ the monoid of `arrow fields' on $\Q$. Physically,
this means that an arrow between two objects in the category is viewed as an
analogue of momentum. After finding the `category quantisation monoid', we show
how suitable representations can be constructed using a bundle (or, more
precisely, presheaf) of Hilbert spaces over $\Ob\Q$. For the example of a
category of finite sets, we construct an explicit representation structure of
this type.

completely positive maps of the density operator. We show that, for Markovian
Bloch maps, the requirement of complete positivity imposes some Bloch

can be established as well. As an illustration of these general properties we

observed that the nonlinear interaction between excitons increases the maximum

model. Therefore, a system of two coupled microcrystallites can be used as a
good source of entanglement with fixed exciton number. The relationship between
the entropy of the entanglement and the population imbalance of two

Casimir-Polder \cite{caspol} retardation force due to atomic motion and present
a preliminary (unpublished) critique on one recently proposed cavity QED
detection scheme of Unruh effect \cite{Unr76}. These two well-known effects
arise from the interaction between a moving atom or detector with a quantum
field under some boundary conditions introduced by a conducting mirror/cavity
or dielectric wall. The Casimir-Polder force is a retardation force on the atom
due to the dressing of the atomic ground state by the vacuum electromagnetic
field in the presence of a conducting mirror or dielectric wall. We have
recently provided an improved calculation by treating the mutual influence of
the atom and the (constrained) field in a self-consistent way. For an atom
moving adiabatically, perpendicular to a mirror, our result finds a coherent
retardation correction up to twice the stationary value. Unruh effect refers
loosely to the fact that a uniformly accelerated detector feels hot. Two prior
schemes have been proposed for the detection of `Unruh radiation', based on
charged particles in linear accelerators and storage rings. Here we are
interested in a third scheme proposed recently by Scully {\it et al}
\cite{Scully03} involving the injection of accelerated atoms into a microwave
or optical cavity. We analyze two main factors instrumental to the purported
success in this scheme, the cavity factor and the sudden switch-on factor. We
conclude that the effects engendered from these factors are unrelated to the
Unruh effect.

that optimally controlled dynamics can be described as a Rabi-like oscillation
between an initial and final state, we derive an analytic optimal field as a

studies using phenomenological potentials for nucleons (or clusters)
interacting with a core. The SUSY potentials result from the transformation of
the mean field potential in order to account for the Pauli blocking of the core
orbitals. In this article, we discuss how other potentials (like external
probes or residual interactions between the valence nucleons) are affected by
the SUSY transformation. We illustrate how the SUSY transformations induce
off-diagonal terms in coordinate space that play the essential role on the
induced transition probabilities on two examples: the electric operators and
Gaussian external fields. We show that excitation operators, doorway states,
strength and sum rules are modified.

Inequalities provide a quantitative criterion to test &quot;reasonable&quot;
Supplementary Parameters Theories versus Quantum Mechanics. Following Bell, I
first explain the motivations for considering supplementary parameters
theories: the argument is based on an analysis of the famous
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) Gedankenexperiment . Introducing a reasonable
Locality Condition, we will then derive Bell's theorem, which states: (i) that
Local Supplementary Parameters Theories are constrained by Bell's Inequalities;
(ii) that certain predictions of Quantum Mechanics violate Bell's Inequalities,
and therefore that Quantum Mechanics is incompatible with Local Supplementary
Parameters Theories. I then point out that a fundamental assumption for this
conflict is the Locality assumption, and I show that in a more sophisticated
version of the E.P.R. thought experiment (&quot;timing experiment&quot;), the Locality
Condition may be considered a consequence of Einstein's Causality, preventing
faster-than-light interactions. The purpose of this first part is to convince
the reader that the formalism leading to Bell's Inequalities is very general
and reasonable. What is surprising is that such a reasonable formalism
conflicts with Quantum Mechanics. In fact, situations exhibiting a conflict are
very rare, and Quantum Optics is the domain where the most significant tests of
this conflict have been carried out, as presented in sections 7 to 11.

  with many degrees of freedom</title><description>  We study the entanglement dynamics of a system consisting of a large number
of coupled harmonic oscillators in various configurations and for different
types of nearest neighbour interactions. For a one-dimensional chain we provide
compact analytical solutions and approximations to the dynamical evolution of
the entanglement between spatially separated oscillators. Key properties such
as the speed of entanglement propagation, the maximum amount of transferred
entanglement and the efficiency for the entanglement transfer are computed. For
harmonic oscillators coupled by springs, corresponding to a phonon model, we
observe a non-monotonic transfer efficiency in the initially prepared amount of
entanglement, i.e., an intermediate amount of initial entanglement is
transferred with the highest efficiency. In contrast, within the framework of
the rotating wave approximation (as appropriate e.g. in quantum optical
settings) one finds a monotonic behaviour. We also study geometrical
configurations that are analogous to quantum optical devices (such as
beamsplitters and interferometers) and observe characteristic differences when
initially thermal or squeezed states are entering these devices. We show that
these devices may be switched on and off by changing the properties of an
individual oscillator. They may therefore be used as building blocks of large
fixed and pre-fabricated but programmable structures in which quantum
information is manipulated through propagation. We discuss briefly possible
experimental realisations of systems of interacting harmonic oscillators in
which these effects may be confirmed experimentally.

experimental point of view. In many theoretical proposals appeared recently,
excitation of atoms into highly excited Rydberg states was considered as a way
to achieve quantum entanglement in cold atomic ensembles via dipole-dipole
interaction that could be strong for Rydberg atoms. Appropriate conditions to
realize a conditional quantum phase gate have been analyzed. We also present
the results of modeling experiments on microwave spectroscopy of single- and
multi-atom excitations at the one-photon 37S-37P and two-photon 37S-38S
transitions in an ensemble of a few sodium Rydberg atoms. The microwave spectra
were investigated for various final states of the ensemble initially prepared
in its ground state. The quantum NOT operation with single atoms was found to
be affected by the Doppler effect and fluctuations of the microwave field. The
spectrum of full excitation of several Rydberg atoms was much narrower than
that of a single atom. This effect might be useful for the high-resolution
spectroscopy. The results may be also applied to the studies on collective
laser excitation of ground-state atoms aiming to realize quantum gates.

obtained by using the certain algebraic properties that Pauli's matrices

explanation. This paper suggests that in general, for an observer to observe
the r coordinate of an event, the process of making that observation must
generate at least as much entropy as the information that the observation

to the result that observers on the surface of a sphere can observe an amount
of information about the enclosed system that is no more than an amount that is

probability, but produce a much smaller multiphoton component. It is therefore
reasonable to approximate the output of these photon sources as a mixture of
the vacuum and single-photon states. We show that it is impossible to increase
the probability for a single photon using linear optics and photodetection on
fewer than four modes. This impossibility is due to the incoherence of the
inputs; if the inputs were pure-state superpositions, it would be possible to
obtain a perfect single-photon output. In the more general case, a chain of
beam splitters can be used to increase the probability for a single photon, but
at the expense of adding an additional multiphoton component. This improvement
is robust against detector inefficiencies, but is degraded by dark counts or
multiphoton components in the input.

distribution $P(k)$,including scale-free(SF) networks with power law
distributions $P(k)\sim k^{-\gamma}$. Considering cases where the transmission
of infection between nodes depends on their connectivity, we introduce a
saturation function $C(k)$ which reduces the infection transmission rate
$\lambda$ across an edge going from a node with high connectivity $k$. A mean

a finite threshold $\lambda_{c}&gt;0$ for SF networks with $2&lt;\gamma \leq 3$. We
also find, in this approximation, the fraction of infected individuals among

dimensionless variable $u$ defined on the unit circle appears as argument of
the phase fields and $u$ is non-linearly related to $z$. Furthermore, form
factors appear which reflect the harmonic trap geometry. The theory is applied
to calculate one-particle correlation functions. In a properly defined
thermodynamic limit, bulk and boundary critical exponents are calculated for
the static two-point correlation function and the dynamic local correlation
function. The local spectral density is also considered. The critical exponents
found are in agreement with those known for OBC with the exception of the

$E\otimes\epsilon$ models the qubit coupled to two independent, degenerate
oscillator modes. In the absence of a transverse magnetic field applied to the
qubit, both systems exhibit a degenerate ground state. Whereas there always
exists a completely separable ground state in the $E\otimes\beta$ system, the
ground states of the $E\otimes\epsilon$ model always exhibit entanglement. For
the $E\otimes\beta$ case we aim to clarify results from previous work, alluding
to a link between the ground state entanglement characteristics and a
bifurcation of a fixed point in the classical analogue. In the
$E\otimes\epsilon$ case we make use of an ansatz for the ground state. We
compare this ansatz to exact numerical calculations and use it to investigate
how the entanglement is shared between the three system degrees of freedom.

cavity interacting with a nonlinear medium (Kerr nonlinearity) is analyzed. The
qubits are assumed to be initially in the maximally entangled states (Bell or
Bell-like states) or the maximally entangled mixed states, on the example of
Werner and Werner-like states. Two kinds of measures of the entanglement are
considered: the concurrence to describe a decay of the entanglement of
formation of the qubits, and the negativity to determine a decay of the
entanglement cost under positive-partial-transpose-preserving operations. It is
observed that the Kerr nonlinearity, in the discussed decoherence model, does
not affect the entanglement of the qubits initially in the Bell or Werner
states, although the evolution of the qubits can depend on this nonlinearity
explicitly. However, it is shown that for the initial Bell-like state and the
corresponding Werner-like state, the loss of the entanglement can be
periodically reduced by inserting the Kerr nonlinearity in the lossy cavity.
Moreover, the relativity of the entanglement measures is demonstrated, to our
knowledge for the first time, as a result of a physical process.

quantum theory. It is an axiom of quantum mechanics that H be Hermitian because
Hermiticity guarantees that the energy spectrum is real and that the time
evolution is unitary (probability preserving). This paper investigates an
alternative way to construct quantum theories in which the conventional
requirement of Hermiticity (combined transpose and complex conjugate) is
replaced by the more physically transparent condition of space-time reflection
(PT) symmetry. It is shown that if the PT symmetry of a Hamiltonian H is not
broken, then the spectrum of H is real. Examples of PT-symmetric non-Hermitian
quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians are H=p^2+ix^3 and H=p^2-x^4. The crucial
question is whether PT-symmetric Hamiltonians specify physically acceptable
quantum theories in which the norms of states are positive and the time
evolution is unitary. The answer is that a Hamiltonian that has an unbroken PT
symmetry also possesses a physical symmetry represented by a linear operator
called C. Using C it is shown how to construct an inner product whose
associated norm is positive definite. The result is a new class of fully
consistent complex quantum theories. Observables are defined, probabilities are
positive, and the dynamics is governed by unitary time evolution. After a
review of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, new results are presented here in
which the C operator is calculated perturbatively in quantum mechanical
theories having several degrees of freedom.

Second, under the assumption that the controlled dynamics is well described by
a Rabi-type oscillaion between unperturbed states, we derive an analytic
expression for the optimal field. Finally we numerically confirm that the
analytic field can steer an initial state to a target state in random matrix
systems.

  condensate via electromagnetically induced transparency</title><description>  In this paper, we present a method to generate continuous-variable-type
entangled states between photons and atoms in atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC). The proposed method involves an atomic BEC with three internal states, a
weak quantized probe laser and a strong classical coupling laser, which form a
three-level Lambda-shaped BEC system. We consider a situation where the BEC is
in electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) with the coupling laser being
much stronger than the probe laser. In this case, the upper and intermediate
levels are unpopulated, so that their adiabatic elimination enables an
effective two-mode model involving only the atomic field at the lowest internal
level and the quantized probe laser field. Atom-photon quantum entanglement is
created through laser-atom and inter-atomic interactions, and two-photon
detuning. We show how to generate atom-photon entangled coherent states and
entangled states between photon (atom) coherent states and atom-(photon-)
macroscopic quantum superposition (MQS) states, and between photon-MQS and
atom-MQS states.

squeezed after passing through the grating and the squeezing ratio saturates

than by absorption, antinormally ordered photodetection can be realized. One of
the distinct features of this photodetection scheme is its sensitivity to
zero-point fluctuation due to the existence of the spontaneous emission. We
have recently succeeded in experimentally demonstrating the antinormally
ordered photodetection by exploiting nondegenerate stimulated parametric
down-conversion process. To properly account for the experiment, the detection
process needs to be treated with time-dependent and continuous-mode operators
because of the broadband nature of the parametric down-conversion process and
the wide spectrum of the pump that we used. Here, we theoretically analyze the
antinormally ordered intensity correlation of the continuous-mode fields by
pursuing the detection process in the Heisenberg picture. It is shown that the
excess positive correlation due to zero-point fluctuation reduces because of
the frequency-distinguishability of the two emitted photon pairs.

theory (if so), I try to define for general physical theories what we mean by
`holism'. For this purpose I propose an epistemological criterion to decide
whether or not a physical theory is holistic, namely: a physical theory is
holistic if and only if it is impossible in principle to infer the global
properties, as assigned in the theory, by local resources available to an
agent. I propose that these resources include at least all local operations and
classical communication. This approach is contrasted with the well-known
approaches to holism in terms of supervenience. The criterion for holism
proposed here involves a shift in emphasis from ontology to epistemology. I
apply this epistemological criterion to classical physics and Bohmian mechanics
as represented on a phase and configuration space respectively, and for quantum
mechanics (in the orthodox interpretation) using the formalism of general
quantum operations as completely positive trace non-increasing maps.
Furthermore, I provide an interesting example from which one can conclude that
quantum mechanics is holistic in the above mentioned sense, although, perhaps
surprisingly, no entanglement is needed.

side factors k1 and k2 of this Concurrence Canonical Decomposition (CCD) are
concurrence symmetries, so the dynamics reduce to consideration of the a

a k2 for n odd. Further, in the odd case we lift the monotone to a two-argument

generalization may also be studied using the CCD, leading again to maximal
concurrence capacity for most unitaries. The key technique is to consider the
spin-flip as a time reversal symmetry operator in Wigner's axiomatization; the
original CCD derivation may be restated entirely in terms of this time
reversal. En route, we observe a Kramers' nondegeneracy: the existence of a
nondegenerate eigenstate of any time reversal symmetric n-qubit Hamiltonian
demands (i) n even and (ii) maximal concurrence of said eigenstate. We provide

with a Wigner distribution of nearest neighbor level spacings. However, these
Hamiltonians involve many-body interactions and the addition of a small
integrable perturbation very quickly leads the system to a Poisson
distribution. Besides this exceptional cases, we show that the accumulated
distribution of an ensemble of random integrable two-body pairing hamiltonians
is in perfect agreement with the Poisson limit. These numerical results for
quantum integrable Hamiltonians provide a further empirical confirmation to the
work of the Berry and Tabor in the semiclassical limit.

Weyl-Titchmarsh-Kodaira spectral theorem, for the spectral function of the
one-dimensional diatomic molecule model consisting of two attractive delta
function wells in the presence of a static external electric field. For
sufficiently deep and far apart wells, this molecule supports both an even and
an odd state, and the introduction of a static electric field turns these bound
states into quasi-bound states which are Stark shifted and broadened. The
continuum spectrum also inherits an intricate pattern of resonances which
reflect the competition between resonant scattering between the two atomic
wells and between the linear potential and one or both atomic well(s). All
results are analytic and can be easily plotted. The relation between the large
orders of the divergent perturbative Stark shift series and the
non-perturbative widths of quasi-bound levels is studied.

with parallel dipole moments are investigated. The collective energy
eigenstates, their level shifts and decay rates are computed utilizing a
decomposition of the atomic state space into carrier spaces for the irreducible
representations of the symmetry group $\ZZ_N$ of the circle. It is shown that
the index $p$ of these representations can be used as a quantum number
analogously to the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ in hydrogen-like
systems. Just as the hydrogen s-states are the only electronic wave functions
which can occupy the central region of the Coulomb potential, the
quasi-particle corresponding to a collective excitation of the atoms in the
circle can occupy the central atom only for vanishing $\ZZ_N$ quantum number
$p$. If a central atom is present, the $p=0$ state splits into two and shows
level-crossing at certain radii; in the regions between these radii, damped
Rabi oscillations between two &quot;extreme&quot; $p=0$ configurations occur. The
physical mechanisms behind super- and subradiance at a given radius and the
divergence of the level shifts at small interatomic distances are discussed. It
is shown that, beyond a certain critical number of atoms in the circle, the
lifetime of the maximally subradiant state increases exponentially with the
number of atoms in the configuration, making the system a natural candidate for
a {\it single-photon trap}.

ultracold atoms by photoassociation, Feshbach resonances, and three-body
recombination. The created molecules are translationally cold, but
vibrationally highly excited. This will eventually lead them to be lost from
the trap due to collisions. We propose shaped laser pulses to transfer these
highly excited molecules to their ground vibrational level. Optimal control
theory is employed to find the light field that will carry out this task with
minimum intensity. We present results for the sodium dimer. The final target
can be reached to within 99% if the initial guess field is physically
motivated. We find that the optimal fields contain the transition frequencies
required by a good Franck-Condon pumping scheme. The analysis is able to
identify the ranges of intensity and pulse duration which are able to achieve
this task before other competing process take place. Such a scheme could
produce stable ultracold molecular samples or even stable molecular
Bose-Einstein condensates.

  initio theory and floating-phase Heitler-London approach</title><description>  Electronic and nuclear spins of shallow donors in Silicon are attractive
candidates for qubits in quantum computer proposals. Shallow donor exchange
gates are frequently invoked to preform two-qubit operations in such proposals.
We study shallow donor electron properties in Si within the Kohn-Luttinger
envelope function approach, incorporating the full Bloch states of the six band
edges of Si conduction band, obtained from {\it ab initio} calculations within
the density-functional and pseudopotential frameworks. Inter-valley
interference between the conduction-band-edge states of Si leads to oscillatory
behavior in the charge distribution of one-electron bound states and in the
exchange coupling in two-electron states. The behavior in the donor electron
charge distribution is strongly influenced by interference from the plane-wave
and periodic parts of the Bloch functions. For two donors, oscillations in the
exchange coupling calculated within the Heitler-London (HL) approach are due to
the plane-wave parts of the Bloch functions alone, which are pinned to the
impurity sites. The robustness of this result is assessed by relaxing the phase
pinning to the donor sites. We introduce a more general theoretical scheme, the
floating-phase HL, from which the previously reported donor exchange
oscillatory behavior is qualitatively and quantitatively confirmed. The
floating-phase formalism provides a ``handle'' on how to theoretically
anticipate the occurrence of oscillatory behavior in electronic properties
associated with electron bound states in more general confining potentials,
such as in quantum dots.

single-spin detection for readout remains a crucial unsolved problem. Schemes
based on adiabatically induced spin-dependent electron tunnelling between
individual donor atoms, detected using a single electron transistor (SET) as an

coupling strength or time scale. The master equation derived in this way
automatically preserves the positivity, Hermiticity and unity.

particles in a (N+2)-particle maximally-entangled states through introducing an
auxiliary qubit and carrying out local measurements. It is shown that the
transmitted classical information amount through such an entangled quantum
channel usually is less than two classical bits. However, the information
amount may reach two classical bits of information, and the classical
information capacity is independent of the number of the entangled particles in
the initial entangled state under certain conditions. The results offer deeper

  spin-entanglement</title><description>  We investigate the spin entanglement in the superconductor-quantum dot system
proposed by Recher, Sukhorukov and Loss, coupling it to an electronic
beam-splitter. The superconductor-quantum dot entangler and the beam-splitter
are treated within a unified framework and the entanglement is detected via
current correlations. The state emitted by the entangler is found to be a
linear superposition of non-local spin-singlets at different energies, a
spin-entangled two-particle wavepacket. Colliding the two electrons in the
beam-splitter, the singlet spin-state gives rise to a bunching behavior,
detectable via the current correlators. The amount of bunching depends on the
relative positions of the single particle levels in the quantum dots and the
scattering amplitudes of the beam-splitter. The singlet spin entanglement,
insensitive to orbital dephasing but suppressed by spin dephasing, is
conveniently quantified via the Fano factors. It is found that the
entanglement-dependent contribution to the Fano factor is of the same magnitude
as the non-entangled, making an experimental detection feasible. A detailed
comparison between the current correlations of the non-local spin-singlet state
and other states, possibly emitted by the entangler, is performed. This
provides conditions for an unambiguous identification of the non-local singlet
spin entanglement.

nonlinear interaction between the two photons, and the efficiency of this
nonlinear interaction is typically very tiny in bulk materials. However, we

nonlinearities produced by projective measurements, and with this work
linear-optical quantum computing becomes a new possibility of scalable quantum

mutual information is introduced and the two quantities are compared for a
system of oscillators coupled with both linear and non-linear interactions. The
classical correlations help to understand how much of the quantum loss of
purity are due to intrinsic quantum effects and how much is related to the
probabilistic character of the initial states, a characteristic shared by both
the classical and quantum pictures. Our examples show that, for initially
localized Gaussian states, the classical statistical mutual linear entropy
follows its quantum counterpart for short times. For non-Gaussian states the
behavior of the classical and quantum measures of information are still
qualitatively similar, although the fingerprints of the non-classical nature of
the initial state can be observed in their different amplitudes of oscillation.

describe, the laws of quantum mechanics impose severe restrictions on how that
state can be accessed. This paper shows in three settings that quantum messages
have only limited advantages over classical ones. First, we show that BQP/qpoly
is contained in PP/poly, where BQP/qpoly is the class of problems solvable in
quantum polynomial time, given a polynomial-size &quot;quantum advice state&quot; that
depends only on the input length. This resolves a question of Buhrman, and
means that we should not hope for an unrelativized separation between quantum
and classical advice. Underlying our complexity result is a general new
relation between deterministic and quantum one-way communication complexities,
which applies to partial as well as total functions. Second, we construct an
oracle relative to which NP is not contained in BQP/qpoly. To do so, we use the
polynomial method to give the first correct proof of a direct product theorem
for quantum search. This theorem has other applications; for example, it can be
used to fix a flawed result of Klauck about quantum time-space tradeoffs for
sorting. Third, we introduce a new trace distance method for proving lower
bounds on quantum one-way communication complexity. Using this method, we
obtain optimal quantum lower bounds for two problems of Ambainis, for which no
nontrivial lower bounds were previously known even for classical randomized
protocols.

particles has been experimentally demonstrated and used to obtain the extreme
contradiction between quantum mechanics and local realism, the realization of
five-particle entanglement remains an experimental challenge. Meanwhile, a
crucial experimental challenge in multi-party quantum communication and
computation is the so-called open-destination teleportation. During
open-destination teleportation, an unknown quantum state of a single particle
is first teleported onto a N-particle coherent superposition to perform
distributed quantum information processing. At a later stage this teleported
state can be readout at any of the N particles for further applications by
performing a projection measurement on the remaining N-1 particles. Here, we
report a proof-of-principle demonstration of five-photon entanglement and
open-destination teleportation. In the experiment, we use two entangled photon
pairs to generate a four-photon entangled state, which is then combined with a
single photon state to achieve the experimental goals. The methods developed in
our experiment would have various applications e.g. in quantum secret sharing

classical optics and quantum mechanical theories in phase space, especially
between the Wigner distribution functions defined in the respective phase
spaces. Classical optics is able to provide an understanding of either the
corpuscular or wave aspects of quantum mechanics, reflected in phase space
through the classical limit of the quantum Wigner distribution function or the
Wigner distribution function in classical optics, respectively. However,
classical optics, as any classical theory, cannot mimic the wave-particle
duality that is at the heart of quantum mechanics. Moreover, it is never enough
underlined that, although the mathematical phase space formalisms in classical
optics and quantum mechanics are very similar, the main difference between
these theories, evidenced in the results of measurements, is as deep as it can
get even in phase space. On the other hand, the phase space treatment allows an
unexpected similar treatment of interference phenomena, although quantum and
classical superpositions of wavefunctions and fields, respectively, have a
completely different behavior. This similarity originates in the bilinear
character of the Wigner distribution function in both quantum mechanics and
classical optical wave theory. Actually, the phase space treatment of the
quantum and classical wave theory is identical from the mathematical point of
view, if the Planck constant is replaced by the wavelength of light. Even
Wigner distribution functions of particular quantum states, such as the
Schrodinger cat state, can be mimicked by classical optical means, but not the
true quantum character, which resides in the probability significance of the
wavefunction, in comparison to the physical realness of classical wave fields.

at the same time that it is non-adiabatically inverted. For polynomial twist,
\phi(t) \sim Bt^{n}. We show that for n \ge 3, multiple qubit resonances can

interference is controllable through variation of the twist strength B.
Constructive and destructive interference are possible, greatly enhancing or

Negative group velocity as low as -c/10^6=-80 m/s is recorded. We also find

  quantum $(\bf N+1)$ marginal theorem</title><description>  We study the problem of constructing a probability density in 2N-dimensional
phase space which reproduces a given collection of $n$ joint probability
distributions as marginals. Only distributions authorized by quantum mechanics,
i.e. depending on a (complete) commuting set of $N$ variables, are considered.
A diagrammatic or graph theoretic formulation of the problem is developed. We
then exactly determine the set of ``admissible'' data, i.e. those types of data
for which the problem always admits solutions. This is done in the case where
the joint distributions originate from quantum mechanics as well as in the case
where this constraint is not imposed. In particular, it is shown that a
necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the existence of solutions is
$n\leq N+1$. When the data are admissible and the quantum constraint is not
imposed, the general solution for the phase space density is determined
explicitly. For admissible data of a quantum origin, the general solution is
given in certain (but not all) cases. In the remaining cases, only a subset of
solutions is obtained.

at least a great step forward towards a solution of the quantum measurement
problem. It is shown here however that in the cases in which a sentient being
is explicitly assumed to take cognizance of the outcome the reasons we have for
judging this way are not totally consistent, so that the question has to be
considered anew. It is pointed out that the way the Broglie-Bohm model solves
the riddle suggests a possible clue, consisting in assuming that even very
simple systems may have some sort of a proto-consciousness, but that their
``internal states of consciousness'' are not predictive. It is, next, easily
shown that if we imagine the systems get larger, in virtue of decoherence their
internal states of consciousness progressively gain in predictive value. So
that, for macro-systems, they may be identified (in practice) with the
predictive states of consciousness on which we ground our observational
predictions. The possibilities of carrying over this idea to standard quantum
mechanics are then investigated. Conditions of conceptual consistency are
considered and found rather strict, and, finally, two solutions emerge,
differing conceptually very much from one another but in both of which the,
possibly non-predictive, generalized internal states of consciousness play a
crucial role.

  Rotations: Direct Two-Level vs. Off-Resonant Raman Excitation</title><description>  In a direct two-level qubit system, when the Rabi frequency is comparable to
the resonance frequency, the rotating wave approximation is not appropriate. In
this case, the Rabi oscillation is accompanied by another oscillation at twice
the frequency of the driving field, the so called Bloch-Siegert oscillation

oscillation may restrict the precise rotation of a qubit made of direct

quantum information protocols such as teleportation, logic-gate teleportation,

from the combination of the --apparently purely qualitative-- structures of

C(I,I), where C is the category and I is the tensor unit, in order to perform
various protocols such as teleportation. Our formalism captures both the
information-flow aspect of the protocols (see quant-ph/0402014), and the
branching due to quantum indeterminism. This contrasts with the standard
accounts, in which the classical information flows are `outside' the usual
quantum-mechanical formalism.

  At the 1970 spring meeting of the American Physical Society held in
Washington, DC, R. P. Feynman stunned the audience by proposing harmonic
oscillators for relativistic bound states, instead of Feynman diagrams. His
talk was later published in the paper of Feynman, Kislinger, and Ravndal [Phys.
Rev. D, Vol. 3, 2706 (1971)]. These authors noted that the hadron mass spectra
can be predicted by the degeneracy of the three-dimensional harmonic
oscillators. In so doing, they started with the Lorentz-invariant differential
equation for the harmonic oscillator, and obtained Lorentz invariant solutions.
However, their solutions are not normalizable in the time-separation variable
and cannot carry probability interpretation. It is pointed out that there are
solutions normalizable in the time-separation variable within the framework of
Wigner's little-group representation of the Poincar\'e group. These solutions
are not invariant but covariant under Lorentz transformations. These solutions
give a covariant bound-state model which gives the quark model and the parton
model as two different limiting cases, in the low- and high-speed limits
respectively.

  cooling the three level $\Lambda$ system</title><description>  We study the problem of optimal control of dissipative quantum dynamics.
Although under most circumstances dissipation leads to an increase in entropy
(or a decrease in purity) of the system, there is an important class of
problems for which dissipation with external control can decrease the entropy
(or increase the purity) of the system. An important example is laser cooling.
In such systems, there is an interplay of the Hamiltonian part of the dynamics,
which is controllable and the dissipative part of the dynamics, which is
uncontrollable. The strategy is to control the Hamiltonian portion of the
evolution in such a way that the dissipation causes the purity of the system to
increase rather than decrease. The goal of this paper is to find the strategy
that leads to maximal purity at the final time. Under the assumption that
Hamiltonian control is complete and arbitrarily fast, we provide a general
framework by which to calculate optimal cooling strategies. These assumptions
lead to a great simplification, in which the control problem can be
reformulated in terms of the spectrum of eigenvalues of $\rho$, rather than
$\rho$ itself. By combining this formulation with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman
theorem we are able to obtain an equation for the globaly optimal cooling
strategy in terms of the spectrum of the density matrix. For the three-level
$\Lambda$ system, we provide a complete analytic solution for the optimal
cooling strategy. For this system it is found that the optimal strategy does
not exploit system coherences and is a 'greedy' strategy, in which the purity
is increased maximally at each instant.

bath is studied with the purpose of elucidating the differences between the
relaxation to a spin bath and to a harmonic bath. Converged results are
obtained for the spin bath by the Surrogate Hamiltonian approach. This method
is based on constructing a system-bath Hamiltonian, with a finite but large
number of spin bath modes, that mimics exactly a bath with an infinite number
of modes for a finite time interval. Convergence with respect to the number of
simultaneous excitations of bath modes can be checked. The results are compared
to calculations that include a finite number of harmonic modes carried out by
using the multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree method of Nest and Meyer,
[J. Chem. Phys. 119, 24 (2003)]. In the weak coupling regime, at zero
temperature and for small excitations of the primary system, both methods
converge to the Markovian limit. When initially the primary system is
significantly excited, the spin bath can saturate restricting the energy
acceptance. An interaction term between bath modes that spreads the excitation
eliminates the saturation. The loss of phase between two cat states has been
analyzed and the results for the spin and harmonic baths are almost identical.
For stronger couplings, the dynamics induced by the two types of baths deviate.
The accumulation and degree of entanglement between the bath modes have been
characterized. Only in the spin bath the dynamics generate entanglement between
the bath modes.

sensitivity of interferometric measurements of gravitational wave is limited by
the so called standard quantum limit. cavity with a movable mirror. The
internal field stored in such cavity can be orders of magnitude greater than
the input field, and it's radiation pressure force can change the physical
length of the cavity. In turn, any change in the mirror's position changes the
phase of the out put field. This optomechanical coupling leads to an
intensity-dependent phase shift for the light equivalent to an optical Kerr
effect. Such a device can then be used for squeezing generation or quantum
nondemolition measurements. In our experiment, we send a laser beam in to a
high-finesse optical cavity with a movable mirror coated on a high Q-factor
mechanical resonator. Quantum effects of radiation pressure become therefore,
at low temperature, experimentally observable. However, we've shown that the
phase of the reflected field is very sensitive to small mirror displacements,

- the processes that limit the appearance of quantum effects and turn them into
classical phenomena. One important cause of decoherence is the interaction of a
quantum system with its environment, which 'entangles' the two and distributes
the quantum coherence over so many degrees of freedom as to render it
unobservable. Decoherence theory has been complemented by experiments using
matter waves coupled to external photons or molecules, and by investigations
using coherent photon states, trapped ions and electron interferometers. Large
molecules are particularly suitable for the investigation of the
quantum-classical transition because they can store much energy in numerous
internal degrees of freedom; the internal energy can be converted into thermal
radiation and thus induce decoherence. Here we report matter wave
interferometer experiments in which C70 molecules lose their quantum behaviour
by thermal emission of radiation. We find good quantitative agreement between
our experimental observations and microscopic decoherence theory. Decoherence
by emission of thermal radiation is a general mechanism that should be relevant
to all macroscopic bodies.

toward the creation of a scalable quantum computer. One possible approach
toward solving part of this problem is distributed computing, which provides an
effective way of utilizing a network of limited capacity quantum computers.
  In this paper, we present two primitive operations, cat-entangler and
cat-disentangler, which in turn can be used to implement non-local operations,
e.g. non-local CNOT and quantum teleportation. We also show how to establish an
entangled pair, and use entangled pairs to efficiently create a generalized GHZ
state. Furthermore, we present procedures which allow us to reuse channel
qubits in a sequence of non-local operations.
  These non-local operations work on the principle that a cat-like state,
created by cat-entangler, can be used to distribute a control qubit among
multiple computers. Using this principle, we show how to efficiently implement
non-local control operations in many situation, including a parallel
implementation of a certain kind of unitary transformation. Finally, as an
example, we present a distributed version of the quantum Fourier transform.

Clifton-Bub-Halvorson theorem characterizing quantum theory in terms of three
information-theoretic constraints (Foundations of Physics 33, 1561-1591 (2003);
quant-ph/0211089). I argue that: (1) a quantum theory is best understood as a
theory about the possibilities and impossibilities of information transfer, as
opposed to a theory about the mechanics of nonclassical waves or particles, (2)
given the information-theoretic constraints, any mechanical theory of quantum
phenomena that includes an account of the measuring instruments that reveal
these phenomena must be empirically equivalent to a quantum theory, and (3)
assuming the information-theoretic constraints are in fact satisfied in our
world, no mechanical theory of quantum phenomena that includes an account of
measurement interactions can be acceptable, and the appropriate aim of physics
at the fundamental level then becomes the representation and manipulation of
information.

to an optical resonator. In the strong coupling regime the cavity field
generated by atomic scattering interferes destructively with the pump on the
atoms. This suppresses atomic excitation and even for strong driving fields
prevents atomic saturation, while the stationary intracavity field amplitude is
almost independent of the atom number. The magnitude of the interference effect
depends on the detuning between laser and cavity field and on the relative
atomic positions and is strongest for a wavelength spaced lattice of atoms
placed at the antinodes of the cavity mode. In this case three dimensional
intensity minima are created in the vicinity of each atom. In this regime
spontaneous emission is suppressed and the dominant loss channel is cavity
decay. Even for a cavity linewidth larger than the atomic natural width, one
regains strong interference through the cooperative action of a sufficiently
large number of atoms. These results give a new key to understand recent
experiments on collective cavity cooling and may allow to implement fast

complementary contexts set by incompatible measurements. We argue that an
arbitrary preparation, therefore, should be described with respect to such a
context by its degrees of disturbance (represented by real numbers) and their
probability distribution (postulate 1). Measurement contexts thus provide
reference frames for the preparation space of a physical system; a preparation
being described by a point in this space with the aforementioned as its
coordinates relative to a given measurement apparatus. However, all measurement
contexts are equivalent with regard to the description of a given preparation;
there is no preferred measurement (postulate 2). In the framework provided by
the preparation space, we show that quantum mechanics emerges naturally from
the above postulates in a new formulation which is manifestly canonical;
provided the degrees of disturbance are identified with the quantum phases of
the preparation with respect to (the basis furnished by) the measurement
apparatus.

  generalized time-dependent harmonic oscillator</title><description>  The generalized time-dependent harmonic oscillator is studied. Though several
approaches to the solution of this model have been available, yet a new
approach is presented here, which is very suitable for the study of cyclic
solutions and geometric phases. In this approach, finding the time evolution
operator for the Schr\&quot;odinger equation is reduced to solving an ordinary
differential equation for a c-number vector which moves on a hyperboloid in a
three-dimensional space. Cyclic solutions do not exist for all time intervals.
A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of cyclic solutions is
given. There may exist some particular time interval in which all solutions
with definite parity, or even all solutions, are cyclic. Criterions for the
appearance of such cases are given. The known relation that the nonadiabatic
geometric phase for a cyclic solution is proportional to the classical Hannay
angle is reestablished. However, this is valid only for special cyclic
solutions. For more general ones, the nonadiabatic geometric phase may contain
an extra term. Several cases with relatively simple Hamiltonians are solved and
discussed in detail. Cyclic solutions exist in most cases. The pattern of the
motion, say, finite or infinite, can not be simply determined by the nature of
the Hamiltonian (elliptic or hyperbolic, etc.). For a Hamiltonian with a
definite nature, the motion can changes from one pattern to another, that is,
some kind of phase transition may occur, if some parameter in the Hamiltonian
goes through some critical value.

setups in the two imaging paths, including the crucial point regarding how to
engineer the phase of the idler local oscillator as to observe the desired
orthogonal quadrature components of the image. We point out an inherent link
between the far-field bandwidth and the near-field resolution of the reproduced

However, we show how to circumvent this limitation by using a spatial averaging
technique which dramatically improves the imaging bandwidth of the far-field
correlations as well as speeds up the convergence rate. The results are backed

counter-propagating traveling wave modes. It is found that the dynamics of the
atoms strongly depends on the quantization procedure for the cavity field. For
standing waves, no correlations develop between the cavity field and the atoms.
Consequently, standing wave Fock states yield the same results as a classical
standing wave field while coherent states give rise to a collapse and revivals
in the scattering of the atoms. In contrast, for traveling waves the scattering
results in quantum entanglement of the radiation field and the atoms. This
leads to a collapse and revival of the scattering probability even for Fock
states. The Pauli Exclusion Principle manifests itself as an additional
dephasing of the scattering probability.

to the Holevo capacity and to the minimal output entropy of this channel. Some
properties of these sets as well as the necessary and sufficient condition for
their coincidence are obtained. The relations between additivity properties for
two quantum channels and the structure of the optimal sets for tensor product
of these channels are considered. It turns out that these additivity properties
are connected with the special hereditary property of the optimal sets for
tensor product channel. We explore the structural properties of these optimal
sets under two different assumptions.
  The first assumption means that for tensor product of two channels with
arbitrary constraints there exists optimal ensemble with the product state
average. It turns out that exactly this assumption guarantees hereditary
property of the both optimal sets for tensor product channel and provides some
observations concerning the additivity problems.
  The second assumption means additivity of the Holevo capacity for two
channels with arbitrary constraints. It turns out that exactly this assumption
guarantees strong hereditary property of the both optimal sets for tensor
product channel and provides the natural &quot;projective&quot; relations between these
sets and the optimal sets for single channels.

  quantum gravity induces a fundamental mechanism for quantum decoherence</title><description>  The use of a relational time in quantum mechanics is a framework in which one
promotes to quantum operators all variables in a system, and later chooses one
of the variables to operate like a ``clock''. Conditional probabilities are
computed for variables of the system to take certain values when the ``clock''
specifies a certain time. This framework is attractive in contexts where the
assumption of usual quantum mechanics of the existence of an external,
perfectly classical clock, appears unnatural, as in quantum cosmology. Until
recently, there were problems with such constructions in ordinary quantum
mechanics with additional difficulties in the context of constrained theories
like general relativity. A scheme we recently introduced to consistently
discretize general relativity removed such obstacles. Since the clock is now an
object subject to quantum fluctuations, the resulting evolution in the time is
not exactly unitary and pure states decohere into mixed states. Here we work
out in detail the type of decoherence generated, and we find it to be of
Lindblad type. This is attractive since it implies that one can have loss of
coherence without violating the conservation of energy. We apply the framework
to a simple cosmological model to illustrate how a quantitative estimate of the
effect could be computed. For most quantum systems it appears to be too small
to be observed, although certain macroscopic quantum systems could in the
future provide a testing ground for experimental observation.

its probability distribution after N steps is determined by reshuffling the
first N distributions that arise in a classical random walk with the same
initial distribution. In a classical walk, entropy increase can be regarded as
a consequence of the majorization ordering of successive distributions. The
Lorenz curves of successive distributions for a symmetric quantum walk reveal
no majorization ordering in general. Nevertheless, entropy can increase, and
computer experiments show that it does so on average. Varying the stages at
which the quantum coin system is traced out leads to new quantum walks,
including a symmetric walk for which majorization ordering is valid but the
spreading rate exceeds that of the usual symmetric quantum walk.

implementing Shor's algorithm have been designed, but each tacitly assumes that

both results express some kind of impossibility it is natural to ask whether
there is any relation between them, and, indeed, this question has been
repeatedly asked for a long time. The main interest seems to have been in
possible implications of incompleteness to physics. In this note we will take
interest in the {\it converse} implication and will offer a positive answer to
the question: Does uncertainty imply incompleteness? We will show that
algorithmic randomness is equivalent to a ``formal uncertainty principle''
which implies Chaitin's information-theoretic incompleteness. We also show that
the derived uncertainty relation, for many computers, is physical. In fact, the
formal uncertainty principle applies to {\it all} systems governed by the wave
equation, not just quantum waves. This fact supports the conjecture that
uncertainty implies randomness not only in mathematics, but also in physics.

introduce a set of macroscopic parameters (landscapes) and put forward an
ansatz of universality for random bit flips. We then formulate the problem of
finding the smallest eigenvalue and the excitation gap as a statistical
mechanics problem. We use the so-called annealing approximation with a
refinement that a finite set of macroscopic variables (versus only energy) is
used, and are able to show the existence of a dynamic threshold
$\gamma=\gamma_d$ starting with some value of K -- the number of variables in
each clause. Beyond dynamic threshold, the algorithm should take exponentially
long time to find a solution. We compare the results for extended and
simplified sets of landscapes and provide numerical evidence in support of our
universality ansatz. We have been able to map the ensemble of random graphs
onto another ensemble with fluctuations significantly reduced. This enabled us
to obtain tight upper bounds on satisfiability transition and to recompute the
dynamical transition using the extended set of landscapes.

Moreover Leung exhibited a universal family of observables composed of 4

by evaluating the action S for all classical paths in coordinate space. A
corresponding momentum path integral may also be defined through Fourier
transforms in the endpoints. Although these momentum path integrals are
especially simple for several special cases, no one has, to my knowledge, ever
formally constructed them from all classical paths in momentum space. I show
that this is possible because there exists another classical mechanics based on
an alternate classical action R. Hamilton's Canonical equations result from a
variational principle in both S and R. S uses fixed beginning and ending
spatial points while R uses fixed beginning and ending momentum points. This
alternative action's classical mechanics also includes a Hamilton-Jacobi
equation. I also present some important points concerning the beginning and
ending conditions on the action necessary to apply a Canonical transformation.
These properties explain the failure of the Canonical transformation in the
phase space path integral. It follows that a path integral may be constructed
from classical position paths using S in the coordinate representation or from
classical momentum paths using R in the momentum representation. Several
example calculations are presented that illustrate the simplifications and
practical advantages made possible by this broader view of the path integral.
In particular, the normalized amplitude for a free particle is found without
using the Schrodinger equation, the internal spin degree of freedom is simply
and naturally derived, and the simple harmonic oscillator is calculated.

differential geometry. Discrete calculus is seen to fit into this pattern by
reformulating it in terms of commutators. Differential geometry begins here,
not with the concept of parallel translation, but with the concept of a
physical trajectory and the algebra related to the Jacobi identity that governs
that trajectory. The paper discusses how Poisson brackets give rise to Jacobi
identity, and how Jacobi identity arises in combinatorial contexts, including
graph coloring and knot theory.
  The paper gives a highly sharpened derivation of results of Tanimura on the
consequences of commutators that generalize the Feynman-Dyson derivation of
electromagnetism, and a generalization of the original Feynman-Dyson result
that makes no assumptions about commutators. The latter result is a consequence
of the definitions of the derivations in a particular non-commutative world.
Our generalized version of electromagnetism sheds light on the orginal
Feynman-Dyson derivation, and has many discrete models.

bipartite properties that may simultaneously exist in a multi-qubit system. The
first expression, valid for an arbitrary pure state of n qubits, demonstrates
that the degree to which single particle properties are possessed by an
individual member of the system is limited by the bipartite entanglement that
exists between that qubit and the remainder of the system. This result implies
that the phenomenon of entanglement sharing is one specific consequence of
complementarity. The second expression, which holds for an arbitrary state of
two qubits, pure or mixed, quantifies a tradeoff between the amounts of
entanglement, separable uncertainty, and single particle properties that are
encoded in the quantum state. The separable uncertainty is a natural measure of
our ignorance about the properties possessed by individual subsystems, and may
be used to completely characterize the relationship between entanglement and
mixedness in two-qubit systems. The two-qubit complementarity relation yields a
useful geometric picture in which the root mean square values of local
subsystem properties act like coordinates in the space of density matrices, and
suggests possible insights into the problem of interpreting quantum mechanics.

universal quantum computation (UQC) can be efficiently simulated. To answer
this question, we construct purification protocols that consume several copies
of $\rho$ and produce a single output qubit with higher polarization. The
protocols allow one to increase the polarization only along certain ``magic''
directions. If the polarization of $\rho$ along a magic direction exceeds a
threshold value (about 65%), the purification asymptotically yields a pure

with regular boundary $\Gamma=\partial M$. The space $\CM$ of self-adjoint
extensions of the covariant Laplacian on $M$ is shown to have interesting
geometrical and topological properties which are related to the different
topological closures of $M$. In this sense, the change of topology of $M$ is
connected with the non-trivial structure of $\CM$. The space $\CM$ itself can
be identified with the unitary group $\CU(L^2(\Gamma,\C^N))$ of the Hilbert
space of boundary data $L^2(\Gamma,\C^N)$. A particularly interesting family of
boundary conditions, identified as the set of unitary operators which are
singular under the Cayley transform, $\CC_-\cap \CC_+$ (the Cayley manifold),
turns out to play a relevant role in topology change phenomena. The singularity
of the Cayley transform implies that some energy levels, usually associated
with edge states, acquire an infinity energy when by an adiabatic change the
boundary condition reaches the Cayley submanifold $\CC_-$. In this sense
topological transitions require an infinite amount of quantum energy to occur,
although the description of the topological transition in the space $\CM$ is
smooth. This fact has relevant implications in string theory for possible
scenarios with joint descriptions of open and closed strings. In the particular
case of elliptic self--adjoint boundary conditions, the space $\CC_-$ can be
identified with a Lagrangian submanifold of the infinite dimensional
Grassmannian. The corresponding Cayley manifold $\CC_-$ is dual of the Maslov

captured by describing polarization by a 3x3 effective density matrix. Here we
show that the effective density matrix corresponds to the actual photodetection
model and we provide a simple formula to calculate it in terms of classical
fields. Moreover, we explore several possible experimental consequences of the
&quot;longitudinal&quot; term: limits on single-photon detection efficiency,
polarization-dependent atomic transitions rates and the implications on quantum
information processing.

optical pumping and spontaneous emission of a photon by the atom. Spontaneous
emission in a random direction is the dissipative mechanism required to remove
entropy from the atom. However, alternative cooling methods have been proposed
for a single atom strongly coupled to a high-finesse cavity; the role of
spontaneous emission is replaced by the escape of a photon from the cavity.
Application of such cooling schemes would improve the performance of atom
cavity systems for quantum information processing. Furthermore, as cavity
cooling does not rely on spontaneous emission, it can be applied to systems
that cannot be laser-cooled by conventional methods; these include molecules
(which do not have a closed transition) and collective excitations of Bose
condensates, which are destroyed by randomly directed recoil kicks. Here we
demonstrate cavity cooling of single rubidium atoms stored in an intracavity
dipole trap. The cooling mechanism results in extended storage times and
improved localization of atoms. We estimate that the observed cooling rate is
at least five times larger than that produced by free-space cooling methods,
for comparable excitation of the atom.

many-particle systems is at the core of a full understanding of phase
transitions in matter. In this work, we continue our investigation of the
notion of generalized entanglement [Barnum et al. Phys. Rev. A 68, 032308
(2003)] by focusing on a simple Lie-algebraic measure of purity of a quantum
state relative to an observable set. For the algebra of local observables on
multi-qubit systems, the resulting local purity measure is equivalent to a
recently introduced global entanglement measure [Meyer and Wallach, J. Math.
Phys. 43, 4273 (2002)]. In the condensed-matter setting, the notion of
Lie-algebraic purity is exploited to identify and characterize the quantum
phase transitions present in two exactly solvable models: the
Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, and the spin-1/2 anisotropic XY model in a
transverse magnetic field. For the latter, we argue that a natural fermionic
observable-set arising after the Jordan-Wigner transformation, better
characterizes the transition than alternative measures based on qubits. This
illustrates the usefulness of going beyond the standard subsystem-based
framework while providing a global disorder parameter for this model. Our
results show how generalized entanglement leads to useful tools for
distinguishing between the ordered and disordered phases in the case of broken
symmetry quantum phase transitions. Additional implications and possible
extensions of concepts to other systems of interest in condensed matter physics
are also discussed.

numerical simulations for a two-dimensional system. We show that a simple
initial ensemble with a non-standard distribution rho not= |psi|^2 of particle
positions evolves towards the quantum distribution to high accuracy. The
relaxation process rho --&gt; |psi|^2 is quantified in terms of a coarse-grained
H-function (equal to minus the relative entropy of rho with respect to
|psi|^2), which is found to decrease approximately exponentially over time,
with a time constant that accords with a simple theoretical estimate.

fundamental importance in quantum information science. It has recently been
shown that this problem is NP-hard. There is a highly inefficient `basic
algorithm' for solving the quantum separability problem which follows from the
definition of a separable state. By exploiting specific properties of the set
of separable states, we introduce a new classical algorithm that solves the

sources. The classical version of this problem was solved by Slepian and Wolf,
who showed that distributed compression could take full advantage of redundancy
in the local sources created by the presence of correlations. We show that, in
general, this is not the case for quantum sources by proving a lower bound on
the rate sum for irreducible sources of product states which is stronger than
the one given by a naive application of Slepian-Wolf. Nonetheless, strategies
taking advantage of correlation do exist for some special classes of quantum
sources. For example, Devetak and Winter demonstrated the existence of such a
strategy when one of the sources is classical. Here we find optimal non-trivial
strategies for a different extreme, sources of Bell states. In addition, we
illustrate how distributed compression is connected to other problems in
quantum information theory, including information-disturbance questions,
entanglement distillation and quantum error correction.

  Phase Transitions</title><description>  This paper addresses the following main question: Do we have a theoretical
understanding of entanglement applicable to a full variety of physical
settings? It is clear that not only the assumption of distinguishability, but
also the few-subsystem scenario, are too narrow to embrace all possible
physical settings. In particular, the need to go beyond the traditional
subsystem-based framework becomes manifest when one tries to apply the
conventional concept of entanglement to the physics of matter, since the
constituents of a quantum many-body system are indistinguishable particles. We
shall discuss here a notion of generalized entanglement, which can be applied
to any operator language (fermions, bosons, spins, etc.) used to describe a
physical system and which includes the conventional entanglement settings
introduced to date in a unified fashion. This is realized by noticing that
entanglement is an observer-dependent concept, whose properties are determined
by the expectations of a distinguished set of observables without reference to
a preferred subsystem decomposition, i.e., it depends on the physically
relevant point of view. This viewpoint depends in turn upon the relationship
between different sets of observables that determine our ability to control the
system of interest. Indeed, the extent to which entanglement is present depends
on the observables used to measure a system and describe its states. This
represents a most conspicuous advantage as will be highlighted by the
condensed-matter application we will discuss.

cross-section when the scattering angle tends to zero but the distance r from
the center remains fixed. Angular distribution of the particles scattered in
the Coulomb field is investigated on the rather large but finite distance r
from the center. It is shown that the standard asymptotic representation of the
wave functions is not available in the case when small scattering angles are
considered. Unitary property of the scattering matrix is analyzed and the

cross-sections for scattering of the particle by the Coulomb center proved to

  In this paper we offer a detailed analytic model for an experimental,

total system behavior ranging from physical effects to the results of quantum

for a wide range of realistic, fiber-based QKD systems; in fact, it provides
nearly 10 times the distilled throughput of systems that employ a more

We affix two
semi-infinite lines to a general finite graph, which we call tails. On the
tails, the particle making the walk simply advances one unit at each time step,
so that its behavior there is analogous to free propagation We are interested
in how many steps it will take the particle, starting on one tail and
propagating through the graph (where its propagation is not free), to emerge
onto the other tail. The probability to make such a walk in n steps and the
hitting time for such a walk can be expressed in terms of the transmission
amplitude for the graph, which is one element of its S matrix. Demonstrating
this necessitates a study of the analyticity properties of the transmission and
reflection amplitudes of a graph. We show that the graph can have bound states
that cannot be accessed by a particle entering the graph from one of its tails.
Time-reversal invariance of a quantum walk is defined and used to show that the
transmission amplitudes for the particle entering the graph from different
directions are the same if the walk is time-reversal invariant.

of robust error-correcting schemes, has fuelled extensive efforts to build a
quantum computer. The requirements for realizing such a device are confounding:
scalable quantum bits (two-level quantum systems, or qubits) that can be well
isolated from the environment, but also initialized, measured and made to
undergo controllable interactions to implement a universal set of quantum logic
gates. The usual set consists of single qubit rotations and a controlled-NOT
(CNOT) gate, which flips the state of a target qubit conditional on the control
qubit being in the state 1. Here we report an unambiguous experimental
demonstration and comprehensive characterization of quantum CNOT operation in
an optical system. We produce all four entangled Bell states as a function of
only the input qubits' logical values, for a single operating condition of the
gate. The gate is probabilistic (the qubits are destroyed upon failure), but
with the addition of linear optical quantum non-demolition measurements, it is
equivalent to the CNOT gate required for scalable all-optical quantum
computation.

  temperatures</title><description>  We study the properties of superconducting electrical circuits, realizing
cavity QED. In particular we explore the limit of strong coupling, low
dissipation, and elevated temperatures relevant for current and future
experiments. We concentrate on the cavity susceptibility as it can be directly
experimentally addressed, i.e., as the impedance or the reflection coefficient
of the cavity. To this end we investigate the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model
in the strong coupling regime at high temperatures. The dynamics is
investigated within the Bloch-Redfield formalism. At low temperatures, when
only the few lowest levels are occupied the susceptibility can be presented as
a sum of contributions from independent level-to-level transitions. This
corresponds to the secular (random phase) approximation in the Bloch-Redfield
formalism. At temperatures comparable to and higher than the oscillator
frequency, many transitions become important and a multiple-peak structure
appears. We show that in this regime the secular approximation breaks down, as
soon as the peaks start to overlap. In other words, the susceptibility is no
longer a sum of contributions from independent transitions. We treat the
dynamics of the system numerically by exact diagonalization of the Hamiltonian
of the qubit plus up to 200 states of the oscillator. We compare the results
obtained with and without the secular approximation and find a qualitative
discrepancy already at moderate temperatures.

quantum Fourier transform (AQFT) provides a suitable replacement for the
regular QFT in many quantum algorithms. Since the AQFT is less accurate by
definition, polynomially many more applications of the AQFT are required to
achieve the original accuracy. However, in many quantum algorithms, the smaller
size of the AQFT circuit yields a net improvement over using the QFT.
  This paper presents a more thorough analysis of the AQFT circuit, which leads
to the surprising conclusion that for sufficiently large input sizes, the
difference between the QFT and the logarithmic-depth AQFT is negligible. In
effect, the AQFT can be used as an direct replacement for the QFT, yielding
improvements in any application which does not require exact quantum

control of the physical interactions between component qubits. This is highly
appealing since the 'switching' of such interactions is a principal difficulty
in creating real devices. It has been established that one can employ 'always
on' interactions in a one-dimensional Heisenberg chain, provided that one can
tune the Zeeman energies of the individual (pseudo-)spins. It is important to
generalize this scheme to higher dimensional networks, since a real device
would probably be of that kind. Such generalisations have been proposed, but
only at the severe cost that the efficiency of qubit storage must *fall*. Here
we propose the use of multi-qubit gates within such higher-dimensional arrays,
finding a novel three-qubit gate that can in fact increase the efficiency
beyond the linear model. Thus we are able to propose higher dimensional
networks that can constitute a better embodiment of the 'always on' concept - a
substantial step toward bringing this novel concept to full fruition.

scheme that is &quot;secure&quot; against any polynomial-time quantum adversary. Our
problem, QSCDff, is to distinguish between two types of random coset states
with a hidden permutation over the symmetric group of finite degree. This
naturally generalizes the commonly-used distinction problem between two
probability distributions in computational cryptography. As our major
contribution, we show that QSCDff has three properties of cryptographic
interest: (i) QSCDff has a trapdoor; (ii) the average-case hardness of QSCDff
coincides with its worst-case hardness; and (iii) QSCDff is computationally at
least as hard as the graph automorphism problem in the worst case. These
cryptographic properties enable us to construct a quantum public-key
cryptosystem, which is likely to withstand any chosen plaintext attack of a
polynomial-time quantum adversary. We further discuss a generalization of
QSCDff, called QSCDcyc, and introduce a multi-bit encryption scheme that relies
on similar cryptographic properties of QSCDcyc.

computer during it's operation it is necessary to make the computation act in a
logically reversible manner\cite{Lan61}. Such logically reversible operations
require a number of auxiliary bits to be stored, maintaining a history of the
computation, and which allows the initial state to be reconstructed by running
the computation in reverse. These auxiliary bits are wasteful of resources and
may require a dissipation of energy for them to be reused. A simple procedure
due to Bennett\cite{Ben73} allows these auxiliary bits to be &quot;tidied&quot;, without
dissipating energy, on a classical computer. All reversible classical
computations can be made tidy in this way. However, this procedure depends upon
a classical operation (&quot;cloning&quot;) that cannot be generalised to quantum
computers\cite{WZ82}. Quantum computations must be logically reversible, and
therefore produce auxiliary qbits during their operation. We show that there
are classes of quantum computation for which Bennett's procedure cannot be
implemented. For some of these computations there may exist another method for
which the computation may be &quot;tidied&quot;. However, we also show there are quantum
computations for which there is no possible method for tidying the auxiliary
qbits. Not all reversible quantum computations can be made &quot;tidy&quot;. This
represents a fundamental additional energy burden to quantum computations. This
paper extends results in \cite{Mar01}.

quantum full adder as a realistic complex algorithm on a large number of qubits
in an Ising-spin quantum computer. Our results are an important step toward
effective modeling of the quantum modular adder which is needed for Shor's and
other quantum algorithms. Our full adder has the following features: (i) The
near-resonant transitions with small detunings are completely suppressed, which
allows us to decrease errors by several orders of magnitude and to model a
1000-qubit full adder. (We add a 1000-bit number using 2001 spins.) (ii) We
construct the full adder gates directly as sequences of radio-frequency pulses,
rather than breaking them down into generalized logical gates, such as
Control-Not and one qubit gates. This substantially reduces the number of
pulses needed to implement the full adder. [The maximum number of pulses
required to add one bit (F-gate) is 15]. (iii) Full adder is realized in a
homogeneous spin chain. (iv) The phase error is minimized: the F-gates generate
approximately the same phase for different states of the superposition. (v)
Modeling of the full adder is performed using quantum maps instead of
differential equations. This allows us to reduce the calculation time to a
reasonable value.

Pauli Group consists of the identity and 9^N-1 traceless operators. The
traceless ones partition into 3^N+1 maximally commuting subsets (MCS's) of
3^N-1 operators each, whose joint eigenbases are mutually unbiased. We prove
that Pauli factor groups of order 3^N are isomorphic to all MCS's, and show how
this result applies in specific cases. For two qutrits, the 80 traceless
operators partition into 10 MCS's. We prove that 4 of the corresponding basis
sets must be separable, while 6 must be totally entangled (and Bell-like). For
three qutrits, 728 operators partition into 28 MCS's with less rigid structure
allowing for the coexistence of separable, partially-entangled, and totally
entangled (GHZ-like) bases. However, a minimum of 16 GHZ-like bases must occur.
Every basis state is described by an N-digit trinary number consisting of the
eigenvalues of N observables constructed from the corresponding MCS.

  representation</title><description>  Quantum-mechanical phenomena are playing an increasing role in information
processing, as transistor sizes approach the nanometer level, and quantum
circuits and data encoding methods appear in the securest forms of
communication. Simulating such phenomena efficiently is exceedingly difficult
because of the vast size of the quantum state space involved. A major
complication is caused by errors (noise) due to unwanted interactions between
the quantum states and the environment. Consequently, simulating quantum
circuits and their associated errors using the density matrix representation is
potentially significant in many applications, but is well beyond the
computational abilities of most classical simulation techniques in both time
and memory resources. The size of a density matrix grows exponentially with the
number of qubits simulated, rendering array-based simulation techniques that
explicitly store the density matrix intractable. In this work, we propose a new
technique aimed at efficiently simulating quantum circuits that are subject to
errors. In particular, we describe new graph-based algorithms implemented in
the simulator QuIDDPro/D. While previously reported graph-based simulators
operate in terms of the state-vector representation, these new algorithms use
the density matrix representation. To gauge the improvements offered by
QuIDDPro/D, we compare its simulation performance with an optimized array-based
simulator called QCSim. Empirical results, generated by both simulators on a
set of quantum circuit benchmarks involving error correction, reversible logic,
communication, and quantum search, show that the graph-based approach far
outperforms the array-based approach.

It is shown that such processes can be embedded in a Markovian dynamics which
involves a time dependent Lindblad generator on an extended state space. If the
state space of the open system is given by some Hilbert space ${\mathcal{H}}$,
the extended state space is the triple Hilbert space
${\mathcal{H}}\otimes{\mathbb C}^3$ which is obtained by combining the open
system with a three state system. This embedding is used to derive an
unraveling for non-Markovian time evolution by means of a stochastic process in
the extended state space. The process is defined through a stochastic
Schr\&quot;odinger equation which generates genuine quantum trajectories for the
state vector conditioned on a continuous monitoring of an environment. The
construction leads to a continuous measurement interpretation for non-Markovian

investigated for a qubit represented by the spin of an electron localized in a
self-assembled quantum dot. The localized electron wave function is evaluated
within the atomistic tight-binding model. The magnetic field generated by the
nuclear spins is estimated in the presence of an inhomogeneous environment
characterized by a random nuclear spin configuration, by the dot-size
distribution, by alloy disorder, and by interface disorder. Due to these
inhomogeneities, the magnitude of the nuclear magnetic field varies from one
qubit to another by the order of 100 G, 100 G, 10 G, and 0.1 G, respectively.
The fluctuation of the magnetic field causes errors in exchange operations due
to the inequality of the Zeeman splitting between two qubits. We show that the
errors can be made lower than the quantum error threshold if an exchange energy
larger than 0.1 meV is used for the operation.

discrimination with a minimum probability of inferring an erroneous result, and
the second is unambiguous, i. e. error-free, discrimination with a minimum
probability of getting an inconclusive outcome, where the measurement fails to

investigate the relation between the minimum error probability achievable in
conclusive discrimination, and the minimum failure probability that can be
reached in unambiguous discrimination of the same two states. The latter turns
out to be at least twice as large as the former for any two given states. As an
example, we treat the case that the state of the quantum system is known to be,
with arbitrary prior probability, either a given pure state, or a uniform
statistical mixture of any number of mutually orthogonal states. For this case
we derive an analytical result for the minimum probability of error and perform

part) for the computational speedups recently observed in some quantum walk
algorithms. We find that continuous-time quantum walks can exploit the covering
space property of certain graphs. We demonstrate that a quantum walk on a graph
Y which covers a smaller graph X can be equivalent to a quantum walk on the
smaller graph X. This equivalence occurs only when the walk begins on certain
initial states, fibre-constant states, which respect the graph covering space
structure. We illustrate these observations with walks on Cayley graphs; we
show that walks on fibre-constant initial states for Cayley graphs are
equivalent to walks on the induced Schreier graph. We also consider the problem
of constructing efficient gate sequences simulating the time evolution of a
continuous-time quantum walk. For the case of the walk on the m-torus graph T^m
on 2^n vertices we construct a gate sequence which uses O(\poly(n)) gates which
is independent of the time t the walk is simulated for (and so the sequence can
simulate the walk for exponential times). We argue that there exists a wide
class of nontrivial operators based on quantum walks on graphs which can be
measured efficiently. We introduce a new general class of computational
problems, HiddenCover, which includes a variant of the general hidden subgroup
problem as a subclass. We argue that quantum computers ought to be able to
utilise covering space structures to efficiently solve HiddenCover problems.

radiation force of Casimir-Polder type acting on an atom which is positioned
near dispersing and absorbing magnetodielectric bodies and initially prepared
in an arbitrary electronic state. It is shown that minimal and multipolar
coupling lead to essentially the same lowest-order perturbative result for the
force acting on an atom in an energy eigenstate. To go beyond perturbation
theory, the calculations are based on the exact center-of-mass equation of
motion. For a nondriven atom in the weak-coupling regime, the force as a
function of time is a superposition of force components that are related to the
electronic density-matrix elements at a chosen time. Even the force component
associated with the ground state is not derivable from a potential in the
ususal way, because of the position dependence of the atomic polarizability.
Further, when the atom is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of
energy eigenstates, then temporally oscillating force components are observed,
which are due to the interaction of the atom with both electric and magnetic
fields.

dynamics is regular, we obtain interference fringes whose visibility can be
controlled by changing the parameters of the initial state. However, if we
modify the shape of the billiard thus rendering classical (ray) dynamics fully

to chaotic motion in a deterministic classical system, in absence of any
external noise, leads to a profound modification in the quantum behaviour.

the scalar part of the product of vectors. It provides a natural framework in

similarly their Lie algebras. In this article we show how the geometric algebra
of a six-dimensional real Euclidean vector space naturally allows one to
construct the special unitary group on a two-qubit (quantum bit) Hilbert space,
in a fashion similar to that used in the well-established Bloch sphere model
for a single qubit. This is then used to illustrate the Cartan decompositions

frequencies has not been achieved because the source used (a laser) was not
`truly coherent'. Van Enk, and Fuchs [Phys. Rev. Lett, {\bf 88}, 027902
(2002)], while arguing against Rudolph and Sanders, also accept that an
`absolute phase' is achievable, even if it has not been achieved yet. I will
argue to the contrary that `true coherence' or `absolute phase' is always
illusory, as the concept of absolute time (at least for frequencies beyond
direct human experience) is meaningless. All we can ever do is to use an agreed
time standard. In this context, a laser beam is fundamentally as good a `clock'
as any other. I explain in detail why this claim is true, and defend my
argument against various objections. In the process I discuss super-selection
rules, quantum channels, and the ultimate limits to the performance of a laser

hydrogen atom in parallel static and microwave electric fields. Using an
appropriate representation and averaging approximations we show that resonant
ionisation is controlled by a separatrix, and provide necessary conditions for
a dynamical resonance to affect the ionisation probability.
  The position of the dynamical resonance is computed using a high-order
perturbation series, and estimate its radius of convergence. We show that the
position of the dynamical resonance does not coincide precisely with the
ionisation maxima, and that the field switch-on time can dramatically affect
the ionisation signal which, for long switch times, reflects the shape of an
incipient homoclinic. Similarly, the resonance ionisation time can reflect the
time-scale of the separatrix motion, which is therefore longer than
conventional static field Stark ionisation. We explain why these effects should
be observed in the quantum dynamics.

standard type AIII involution produces the Cosine-Sine Decomposition (CSD), a
well-known decomposition in numerical linear algebra which may be computed
using mature, stable algorithms. In the course of our proof that the KGD is
type AIII, we further establish the following. Khaneja and Glaser allow for a
particular degree of freedom, namely the choice of a commutative algebra a, in
their construction. Let SWAP denote a swap between qubits 1 and n. Then for
appropriate choice of a, the KGD by (SWAP v SWAP)=k1 a k2 may be recovered from
a CSD by v = (SWAP k1 SWAP) (SWAP a SWAP) (SWAP k2 SWAP).

This objective is equivalent to asking the question: if the detector declares
that a specific state is present, what is the probability of that state
actually being present? We show that maximizing this worst-case probability
(maximizing the smallest possible value of this probability) is a quasiconvex
optimization over the matrices of the POVM (positive operator valued measure)
which characterize the measurement apparatus. We also show that with a given
POVM, the optimization is quasiconvex in the matrix which characterizes the
Kraus operator sum representation (OSR) in a fixed basis. We use Lagrange
Duality Theory to establish the optimality conditions for both deterministic

single pure state. Numerical aspects of using convex optimization for quantum

implementations of quantum gate operations which are necessary for quantum
information processing. We will discuss two possible realizations. One of them
is based on qubits being encoded in atomic degrees of freedom where the atoms
are manipulated in optical lattices above atom chips. The other realization is
based on photonic qubits and measurement-induced nonlinearities in linear
optics. Both implementations have in common that their main decoherence
mechanism is absorption in dielectric materials. The quantum theory of light in
absorbing media and its implications to decoherence will form the last part of
the lectures.

called &quot;quantum walk&quot;, in which the particle moves macroscopically correlating
to the inner states. It has been well known that a particle in the ``Hadamard

find one-dimensional quantum walk with multi-state in which a particle stays at
the starting point entirely with high positive probability. This striking
difference is explained from difference between degeneration of eigenvalues of
the time-evolution matrices.

In the protocol,
quantum information of an unknown state of a 2-level particle is faithfully
transmitted from a sender (Alice) to a remote receiver (Bob) via an initially
shared triplet of entangled particles under the control of the supervisor
Charlie. The distributed entangled particles shared by Alice, Bob and Charlie
function as a quantum information channel for faithful transmission. We also
propose a controlled and secure direct communication scheme by means of this
teleportation. After insuring the security of the quantum channel, Alice
encodes the secret message directly on a sequence of particle states and
transmits them to Bob supervised by Charlie using this controlled quantum
teleportation. Bob can read out the encoded message directly by the measurement
on his qubit. In this scheme, the controlled quantum teleportation transmits
Alice's message without revealing any information to a potential eavesdropper.
Because there is not a transmission of the qubit carrying the secret message
between Alice and Bob in the public channel, it is completely secure for
controlled and direct secret communication if perfect quantum channel is used.
The feature of this scheme is that the communication between two sides depends
on the agreement of the third side.

interaction-free measurement (IFM). Using Kwiat et al.'s interferometer, we
construct a two-qubit quantum gate that changes one particle's trajectory
according to whether or not the other particle exists in the interferometer. We
propose a method for distinguishing Bell-basis vectors, each of which consists
of a pair of an electron and a positron, by this gate. (This is called the
Bell-basis measurement.) This method succeeds with probability 1 in the limit
of $N \to \infty$, where N is the number of beam splitters in the
interferometer. Moreover, we can carry out a controlled-NOT gate operation by
the above Bell-basis measurement and the method proposed by Gottesman and
Chuang. Therefore, we can prepare a universal set of quantum gates by the IFM.
This means that we can execute any quantum algorithm by the IFM.

illustrate our method on several examples such as the phase covariant cloning
of qubits, cloning of coherent states, and purification of qubits transmitted
via depolarizing channel and amplitude damping channel. Our examples reveal
that the probabilistic cloner may yield higher fidelity than the best
deterministic cloner even when the states that should be cloned are linearly

ultra-cold atom that is coupled to a magnetic field. We apply this theory to an
atom in the vicinity of a 2-layer cylindrical absorbing dielectric body
surrounded by an unbounded homogeneous medium. An analytical expression is
obtained for the spontaneous and thermal spin-flip rate in this particular

the cylindrical body affects the lifetime when (i) the distance from the wire
to the atom is fixed and (ii) when the distance from the wire to the atom is
scaled.

  deleting</title><description>  Impossibility of cloning and deleting of unknown states are important
restrictions on processing of information in the quantum world. On the other
hand, a known quantum state can always be cloned or deleted. However if we
restrict the class of allowed operations, there will arise restrictions on the
ability of cloning and deleting machines. We have shown that cloning and
deleting of known states is in general not possible by local operations. This
impossibility hints at quantum correlation in the state. We propose dual
measures of quantum correlation based on the dual restrictions of no local
cloning and no local deleting. The measures are relative entropy distances of
the desired states in a (generally impossible) perfect local cloning or local
deleting process from the best approximate state that is actually obtained by
imperfect local cloning or deleting machines. Just like the dual measures of
entanglement cost and distillable entanglement, the proposed measures are based
on important processes in quantum information. We discuss their properties. For
the case of pure states, estimations of these two measures are also provided.
Interestingly, the entanglement of cloning for a maximally entangled state of
two two-level systems is not unity.

  traps: a novel route to study fermion superfluidity</title><description>  The study of low density, ultracold atomic Fermi gases is a promising avenue
to understand fermion superfluidity from first principles. One technique
currently used to bring Fermi gases in the degenerate regime is sympathetic
cooling through a reservoir made of an ultracold Bose gas. We discuss a
proposal for trapping and cooling of two-species Fermi-Bose mixtures into
optical dipole traps made from combinations of laser beams having two different
wavelengths. In these bichromatic traps it is possible, by a proper choice of
the relative laser powers, to selectively trap the two species in such a way
that fermions experience a stronger confinement than bosons. As a consequence,
a deep Fermi degeneracy can be reached having at the same time a softer
degenerate regime for the Bose gas. This leads to an increase in the
sympathetic cooling efficiency and allows for higher precision thermometry of
the Fermi-Bose mixture.

  Systems</title><description>  The spinor representation of the Lorentz group does not accept simple
generalization with the group GL(4,R) of general linear coordinate
transformations. The Dirac equation may be written for an arbitrary choice of a
coordinate system and a metric, but the covariant linear transformations of the
four-component Dirac spinor exist only for isometries. For usual diagonal
Minkowski metric the isometry is the Lorentz transformation. On the other hand,
it is possible to define the Dirac operator on the space of anti-symmetric
(exterior) forms, and in such a case the equation is covariant for an arbitrary
general linear transformation. The space of the exterior forms is
16-dimensional, but usual Dirac equation is defined for four-dimensional
complex space of Dirac spinors. Using suggested analogy, in present paper is
discussed possibility to consider the space of Dirac spinors as some
&quot;subsystem&quot; of a bigger space, where the group GL(4,R) of general relativity
acts in a covariant way.
  For such purposes in this article is considered both Grassmann algebra of
complex anti-symmetric forms and Clifford algebra of Dirac matrices. Both
algebras have same dimension as linear spaces, but different structure of
multiplication. The underlying sixteen-dimensional linear space also may be
considered either as space of complex 4 x 4 matrices, or as space of states of
two particles: the initial Dirac spinor and some auxiliary system. It is shown
also, that such approach is in good agreement with well known idea to consider
Dirac spinor as some ideal of Clifford algebra. Some other possible
implications of given model are also discussed.

measurement problem and the quantization of gravity--involve the interaction of
a quantum system with a classical environment. Two linearly coupled harmonic
oscillators provide a simple, exactly soluble model for exploring such
interaction. Even the ground state of a pair of identical oscillators exhibits
effects on the quantum nature of one oscillator, e.g., a diminution of position
uncertainty, and an increase in momentum uncertainty and uncertainty product,
from their unperturbed values. Interaction between quantum and classical
oscillators is simulated by constructing a quantum state with one oscillator
initially in its ground state, the other in a coherent or Glauber state. The
subsequent wave function for this state is calculated exactly, both for
identical and distinct oscillators. The reduced probability distribution for
the quantum oscillator, and its position and momentum expectation values and
uncertainties, are obtained from this wave function. The oscillator acquires an
oscillation amplitude corresponding to a beating between the normal modes of
the system; the behavior of the position and momentum uncertainties can become
quite complicated. For oscillators with equal unperturbed frequencies, i.e., at
resonance, the uncertainties exhibit a time-dependent quantum squeezing which
can be extreme.

parties wishing to communicate classical information without errors over a
noiseless quantum channel, is discussed. We analytically construct
deterministic dense coding schemes for certain classes of non-maximally
entangled states, and numerically obtain schemes in the general case. We study
the dependency of the information capacity of such schemes on the partially
entangled state shared by the two parties. Surprisingly, for $d&gt;2$ it is
possible to have deterministic dense coding with less than one ebit. In this
case the number of alphabet letters that can be communicated by a single
particle, is between $d$ and 2d. In general we show that the alphabet size
grows in &quot;steps&quot; with the possible values $ d, d+1, ..., d^2-2 $. We also find
that states with less entanglement can have greater communication capacity than
other more entangled states.

either through simultaneous measurements of the chirality and particle
position, or as a result of broken links. Both mechanisms drive the system to a
classical diffusive behavior. In the case of measurements, we show that the
diffusion coefficient is proportional to the variance of the initially
localized quantum random walker just before the first measurement. When links
between neighboring sites are randomly broken with probability $p$ per unit
time, the evolution becomes decoherent after a characteristic time that scales
as $1/p$. The fact that the quadratic increase of the variance is eventually
lost even for very small frequencies of disrupting events, suggests that the
implementation of a quantum walk on a real physical system may be severely
limited by thermal noise and lattice imperfections.

particularly adapted to microwave frequency standards using laser cooled atoms.
We describe the atoms by a statistical distribution of Gaussian wave packets
which enables us to derive and quantify effects that are related to the
coherence properties of the atomic source and that have not been considered
previously. We show that, depending on the experimental conditions, the
expected recoil frequency shift can be partially cancelled by these effects
which can be significant at microwave wavelengths whilst negligible at optical
ones. We derive analytical expressions for the observed interference signal in
the weak field approximation, and numerical results for realistic caesium
fountain parameters. In the near future Cs and Rb fountain clocks are expected
to reach uncertainties which are of the same order of magnitude (10^{-16}) as
first estimates of the recoil shift at microwave frequencies. We show, however,
that the partial cancellation predicted by the complete theory presented here
leads to frequency shifts which are up to an order of magnitude smaller.
Nonetheless observation of the microwave recoil shift should be possible under
particular experimental conditions (increased microwave power, variation of
atomic temperature and launching height etc.). We hope that the present paper
can provide some guidance for such experiments that would test the underlying
theory and its assumptions, which in turn is essential for the next generation
of microwave frequency standards.

states having a fully polarization, can produce intrinsic decoherence by
unitary evolution. This effect can give an understanding of recent experiments
on mesoscopic devices as quantum point contacts showing the 0.7 conductance
anomaly and the wide number of data about saturation of dephasing time observed
at very low temperatures, as a fully polarized two dimensional electron gas.
But similar effects can be seen in different area of physics as for example the
Dicke model describing the interaction of two-level systems with a radiation
mode. In this case one can show that decoherence is intrinsic and remove a
Schr\&quot;odinger cat state leaving a single coherent state, collapsing the wave
function in the thermodynamic limit. So, saturation of dephasing time at low
temperatures in mesoscopic devices can be understood by a fully polarized two
dimensional electron gas that, by an exchange model, can be reduced to a
generalized form of the Dicke Hamiltonian and where the quasiparticles are spin
excitations interacting with magnons. In this way, one can see that several
experiments on nanowires and quantum dots can be satisfactorily explained. The
existence of intrinsic decoherence in the thermodynamic limit could have deep
implications in fundamental problems like quantum measurement and
irreversibility. Recent experiments with cavities with a large number of
photons and with nuclear magnetic resonance in organic molecular crystals give
a first strong support to this view.

  via a noncoplanar fiber system</title><description>  A new scheme of realizing the nonadiabatic conditional geometric phase shift
via a noncoplanar (and coiled) fiber system is presented in this Letter. It is
shown that the effective Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of
polarized photons with the fiber medium is just the Wang-Keiji type of
Hamiltonian. This, therefore, means that the coiled fiber system may be an
ideal implementation of realizing the nonadiabatic geometric phase gates for
the topological quantum computation. The remarkable feature of the present
method is that it can automatically meet the conditions and requirements
proposed in the Wang-Keiji scheme: (i) in the coiled fiber system, the
dynamical phase of photon wavefunction caused by the interaction Hamiltonian
automatically vanishes; (ii) the Wang-Keiji requirement for the parameters in
the Wang-Keiji Hamiltonian can be exactly satisfied automatically in the fiber
system; (iii) the conditional initial state can be easily achieved by
manipulating the initial wave vector of polarized photons. Due to these three
advantages, the coiled fiber system may be a potentially practical way of
achieving the nonadiabatic conditional geometric phase shift (and hence the
nonadiabatic geometric quantum gates).

  frequencies</title><description>  The probability `measure' for measurements at two consecutive moments of time
is non-additive. These probabilities, on the other hand, may be determined by
the limit of relative frequency of measured events, which are by nature
additive. We demonstrate that there are only two ways to resolve this problem.
The first solution places emphasis on the precise use of the concept of
conditional probability for successive measurements. The physically correct
conditional probabilities define additive probabilities for two-time
measurements. These probabilities depend explicitly on the resolution of the
physical device and do not, therefore, correspond to a function of the
associated projection operators. It follows that quantum theory distinguishes
between physical events and propositions about events, the latter are not
represented by projection operators and that the outcomes of two-time
experiments cannot be described by quantum logic.
  The alternative explanation is rather radical: it is conceivable that the
relative frequencies for two-time measurements do not converge, unless a
particular consistency condition is satisfied. If this is true, a strong
revision of the quantum mechanical formalism may prove necessary. We stress
that it is possible to perform experiments that will distinguish the two
alternatives.

  Theory-Experiment Connection</title><description>  The problem of how mathematics and physics are related at a foundational
level is of much interest. One approach is to work towards a coherent theory of
physics and mathematics together. Here steps are taken in this direction by
first examining the theory experiment connection. The role of an implied theory
hierarchy and use of computers in comparing theory and experiment is described.
The main idea of the paper is to tighten the theory experiment connection by
bringing physical theories, as mathematical structures over C, the complex
numbers, closer to what is actually done in experimental measurements and
computations. The method replaces C by C_{n} which is the set of pairs,
R_{n},I_{n}, of n figure rational numbers in some basis. The properties of
these numbers are based on the type of numbers that represent measurement
outcomes for continuous variables. A model of space and time based on R_{n} is
discussed. The model is scale invariant with regions of constant step size
interrupted by exponential jumps. A method of taking the limit n to infinity to
obtain locally flat continuum based space and time is outlined. Possibly the
most interesting result is that R_{n} based space is invariant under scale
transformations which correspond to expansion and contraction of space relative
to a flat background. Also the location of the origin, which is a space and
time singularity, does not change under these transformations. Some properties
of quantum mechanics based on C_{n} and on R_{n} space are briefly
investigated.

obtained for infinite ensemble of identically prepared systems lead to
incorrect conclusions for finite ensembles. In particular, exact measurement of
a macroscopic observable significantly disturbs the state of any finite
ensemble. However, we show how this disturbance can be made arbitrarily small
when the measurement are of finite accuracy. We demonstrate a tradeoff between
state disturbance and measurement coarseness as a function of the size of the
ensemble. Using this tradeoff, we show that the histories generated by any
sequence of finite accuracy macroscopic measurements always generate a
consistent family in the absence of large scale entanglement, for sufficiently
large ensembles. Hence, macroscopic observables behave &quot;classically&quot; provided
that their accuracy is coarser than the quantum correlation length-scale of the
system. The role of these observable is also discussed in the context of NMR

checking groups and the encoding-decoding groups. In the checking groups,
taking advantage of the swapping quantum entanglement and Alice's (the message

the number of the checking groups is big enough. After insuring the security of
the quantum channel, Alice encodes her bits via the local unitary operations on
the encoding-decoding groups. Then she performs her Bell measurements on her
photons and publicly announces her measurement results. After her announcement,
the message receiver Bob performs his Bell measurements on his photons and
directly extracts the encoding bits by using the property of the quantum
entanglement swapping. The security of the present scheme is also discussed:

pulses in BECs, by switching off the coupling field, allows the coherent
condensate dynamics to process optical information. We develop a formalism,
applicable in both the weak and strong probe regimes, to analyze such
experiments and establish several new results. Investigating examples relevant
to Rb-87 experimental parameters we see a variety of novel two-component BEC
dynamics occur during the storage, including interference fringes, gentle
breathing excitations, and two-component solitons. We find the dynamics when
the levels |F=1, M_F=-1&gt; and |F=2, M_F=+1&gt; are well suited to designing
controlled processing of the information. By switching the coupling field back
on, the processed information is rewritten onto probe pulses which then
propagate out as slow light pulses. We calculate the fidelity of information
transfer between the atomic and light fields upon the switch-on and subsequent
output. The fidelity is affected both by absorption of small length scale
features and absorption of regions of the pulse stored near the condensate
edge. In the strong probe case, we find that when the oscillator strengths for
the two transitions are equal the fidelity is not strongly sensitive to the
probe strength, while when they are unequal the fidelity is worse for stronger
probes. Applications to distant communication between BECs, squeezed light
generation and quantum information are anticipated.

$\rho_\epsilon = (1-\epsilon)M_d+\epsilon\rho_1$. From a detailed numerical

(2) there exist entangled matrices outside the predicted entanglement region,
and (3) there exist separable matrices inside the same region. It is also shown
that the lower and upper bounds of $\epsilon$ depend on the coefficients of the

tunneling through a nonstationary potential barrier) is applied to
disintegration of atoms and molecules through tunnel barriers formed by applied
constant and time-dependent electric fields. There are two different channels
for such disintegration, electronic and ionic. The electronic mechanism is
associated with the ionization of a molecule into an electron and a positive
ion. The required frequencies are in a wide range between 100 MHz and infrared.
This mechanism may constitute a method of selective destruction of chemical
bonds. The ionic mechanism consists of dissociation of a molecule into two
ions. Since an ion is more massive than an electron, the necessary frequency is
about 1 MHz. This provides a theoretical possibility of a new method of isotope
separation by radio frequency waves.

makes heavy use of the category nCob, whose objects are (n-1)-dimensional
manifolds representing &quot;space&quot; and whose morphisms are n-dimensional cobordisms
representing &quot;spacetime&quot;. Quantum theory makes heavy use of the category Hilb,
whose objects are Hilbert spaces used to describe &quot;states&quot;, and whose morphisms
are bounded linear operators used to describe &quot;processes&quot;. Moreover, the
categories nCob and Hilb resemble each other far more than either resembles
Set, the category whose objects are sets and whose morphisms are functions. In
particular, both Hilb and nCob but not Set are *-categories with a noncartesian
monoidal structure. We show how this accounts for many of the famously puzzling
features of quantum theory: the failure of local realism, the impossibility of
duplicating quantum information, and so on. We argue that these features only
seem puzzling when we try to treat Hilb as analogous to Set rather than nCob,
so that quantum theory will make more sense when regarded as part of a theory
of spacetime.

This motivates a novel reinterpretation of unit complex numbers (and

reformulation is shown to have the emergent property of counterfactual
indefiniteness and is therefore not non-locally causal.

multiple-copy entanglement transformation. First, we find a sufficient
condition of when a given catalyst is useful in producing another specific
target state. As an application of this condition, for any non-maximally
entangled bipartite pure state and any integer $n$ not less than 4, we are able
to explicitly construct a set of $n\times n$ quantum states which can be
produced by using the given state as a catalyst. Second, we prove that for any
positive integer $k$, entanglement-assisted transformation with $k\times
k$-dimensional catalysts is useful in producing a target state if and only if
multiple-copy entanglement transformation with $k$ copies of state is useful in
producing the same target. Moreover, a necessary and sufficient condition for
both of them is obtained in terms of the Schmidt coefficients of the target.
This equivalence of entanglement-assisted transformation and multiple-copy
entanglement transformation implies many interesting properties of entanglement
transformation. Furthermore, these results are generalized to the case of
probabilistic entanglement transformations.

into another one by local operations and classical communications. Then in
general a certain amount of entanglement contained in the initial state will
decrease in the process of transformation. However, an interesting phenomenon
called partial entanglement recovery shows that it is possible to recover some
amount of entanglement by adding another entangled state and transforming the
two entangled states collectively.
  In this paper we are mainly concerned with the feasibility of partial
entanglement recovery. The basic problem we address is whether a given state is
useful in recovering entanglement lost in a specified transformation. In the
case where the source and target states of the original transformation satisfy
the strict majorization relation, a necessary and sufficient condition for
partial entanglement recovery is obtained. For the general case we give two
sufficient conditions. We also give an efficient algorithm for the feasibility
of partial entanglement recovery in polynomial time.
  As applications, we establish some interesting connections between partial
entanglement recovery and the generation of maximally entangled states, quantum
catalysis, mutual catalysis, and multiple-copy entanglement transformation.

Raman transitions, thus creating an effective Hamiltonian that does not

set of all one-bit gates together with almost any one two-bit gate is universal
is considered from the control theory viewpoint.

There are
two ways to approach this question. The first is dynamic: the coupling of a
large object to its environment cause any entanglement to decrease
considerably. The second approach, which is discussed in this paper, puts the
stress on the difficulty to observe a large scale entanglement. As the number
of particles n grows we need an ever more precise knowledge of the state, and
an ever more carefully designed experiment, in order to recognize entanglement.
To develop this point we consider a family of observables, called witnesses,
which are designed to detect entanglement. A witness W distinguishes all the
separable (unentangled) states from some entangled states. If we normalize the
witness W to satisfy |tr(W\rho)| \leq 1 for all separable states \rho, then the
efficiency of W depends on the size of its maximal eigenvalue in absolute
value; that is, its operator norm ||W||. It is known that there are witnesses
on the space of n qbits for which ||W|| is exponential in n. However, we
conjecture that for a large majority of n-qbit witnesses ||W|| \leq O(\sqrt{n
logn}). Thus, in a non ideal measurement, which includes errors, the largest
eigenvalue of a typical witness lies below the threshold of detection. We prove
this conjecture for the family of extremal witnesses introduced by Werner and
Wolf (Phys. Rev. A 64, 032112 (2001)).

bipartite entanglement using the Wootters concurrence -- a measure of the
entanglement of formation, and the negativity -- a measure of the entanglement
cost under the positive-partial-transpose-preserving operations. For two-qubit
pure states, the negativity is the same as the concurrence. However, we
demonstrate analytically on simple examples of various mixtures of Bell and
separable states that the entanglement measures can impose different orderings
on the states. We show which states, in general, give the maximally different
predictions, (i) when one of the states has the concurrence greater but the
negativity smaller than those for the other state, and (ii) when the states are
entangled to the same degree according to one of the measures, but differently
according to the other.

White in 1992 as a method for accurately describing the properties of
one-dimensional quantum lattices. The method, as originally introduced, was
based on the iterative inclusion of sites on a real-space lattice. Based on its
enormous success in that domain, it was subsequently proposed that the DMRG
could be modified for use on finite Fermi systems, through the replacement of
real-space lattice sites by an appropriately ordered set of single-particle
levels. Since then, there has been an enormous amount of work on the subject,
ranging from efforts to clarify the optimal means of implementing the algorithm
to extensive applications in a variety of fields. In this article, we review
these recent developments. Following a description of the real-space DMRG
method, we discuss the key steps that were undertaken to modify it for use on
finite Fermi systems and then describe its applications to Quantum Chemistry,
ultrasmall superconducting grains, finite nuclei and two-dimensional electron
systems. We also describe a recent development which permits symmetries to be
taken into account consistently throughout the DMRG algorithm. We close with an
outlook for future applications of the method.

calculation of the Casimir force between metallic plates. It allows to take
into account the nonlocal connection between the current density and electric
field inside of metals. In general, a material has to be described by two
impedances $Z_{s}(\omega,q)$ and $Z_{p}(\omega,q)$ corresponding to two
different polarization states. In contrast with the approximate Leontovich
impedance they depend not only on frequency $\omega$ but also on the wave
vector along the plate $q$. In this paper only the nonlocal effects happening
at frequencies $\omega&lt;\omega_{p}$ (plasma frequency) are analyzed. We refer to
all of them as the anomalous skin effect. The impedances are calculated for the
propagating and evanescent fields in the Boltzmann approximation. It is found
that $Z_p$ significantly deviates from the local impedance as a result of the
Thomas-Fermi screening. The nonlocal correction to the Casimir force is
calculated at zero temperature. This correction is small but observable at
small separations between bodies. The same theory can be used to find more
significant nonlocal contribution at $\omega\sim\omega_p$ due to the plasmon
excitation.

  Quantum Encryption</title><description>  A quantum encryption scheme (also called private quantum channel, or state
randomization protocol) is a one-time pad for quantum messages. If two parties
share a classical random string, one of them can transmit a quantum state to
the other so that an eavesdropper gets little or no information about the state
being transmitted. Perfect encryption schemes leak no information at all about
the message. Approximate encryption schemes leak a non-zero (though small)
amount of information but require a shorter shared random key. Approximate
schemes with short keys have been shown to have a number of applications in
quantum cryptography and information theory.
  This paper provides the first deterministic, polynomial-time constructions of
quantum approximate encryption schemes with short keys. Previous constructions
(quant-ph/0307104) are probabilistic--that is, they show that if the operators
used for encryption are chosen at random, then with high probability the
resulting protocol will be a secure encryption scheme. Moreover, the resulting
protocol descriptions are exponentially long. Our protocols use keys of the
same length as (or better length than) the probabilistic constructions; to
encrypt $n$ qubits approximately, one needs $n+o(n)$ bits of shared key.
  An additional contribution of this paper is a connection between classical
combinatorial derandomization and constructions of pseudo-random matrix
families in a continuous space.

out of the computational register at intermediate times. Leakage of population
from the register is undesirable since often the states outside the register
are prone to decay and decoherence, and populating them causes a decrease in
the final fidelity. In this work we devise a local optimal control method for
achieving target unitary transformations on a quantum register, while avoiding
intermediate leakage out of the computational submanifold. The technique
exploits a phase locking of the field to the system such as to eliminate the
undesirable excitation. This method is then applied to produce an SU(6) Fourier
transform on the vibrational levels of the ground electronic state of the
Na$_2$ molecule. The emerging mechanism uses two photon resonances to create a
transformation on the quantum register while blocking one photon resonances to
excited states.

static resources and measurements presents us with a strikingly novel viewpoint
for thinking about quantum computation and its powers. We consider the two
major models for doing quantum computation by measurements that have hitherto
appeared in the literature and show that they are conceptually closely related
by demonstrating a systematic local mapping between them. This way we
effectively unify the two models, showing that they make use of interchangeable
primitives. With the tools developed for this mapping, we then construct more
resource-effective methods for performing computation within both models and
propose schemes for the construction of arbitrary graph states employing
two-qubit measurements alone.

  correlations and thermal effects</title><description>  The influence of correlations of uniform Fermi systems (nuclear matter,
electron gas and liquid $^3$He) on Shannon's information entropy, $S$, is
studied. $S$ is the sum of the information entropies in position and momentum
spaces. It is found that, for three different Fermi systems with different
particle interactions, the correlated part of $S$ ($S_{cor}$) depends on the
correlation parameter of the systems or on the discontinuity gap of the
momentum distribution through two parameter expressions. The values of the
parameters characterize the strength of the correlations. A two parameter
expression also holds between $S_{cor}$ and the mean kinetic energy ($K$) of
the Fermi system. The study of thermal effects on the uncorrelated electron gas
leads to a relation between the thermal part of $S$ ($S_{thermal}$) and the
fundamental quantities of temperature, thermodynamical entropy and the mean
kinetic energy. It is found that, in the case of low temperature limit, the
expression connecting $S_{thermal}$ with $K$ is the same to the one which
connects $S_{cor}$ with $K$. There are only some small differences on the
values of the parameters. Thus, regardless of the reason (correlations or
thermal) that changes $K$, $S$ takes almost the same value.

  hydrogenic systems</title><description>  Time evolution of radial wave packets built from the eigenstates of Dirac
equation for a hydrogenic systems is considered. Radial wave packets are
constructed from the states of different $n$ quantum number and the same lowest
angular momentum. In general they exhibit a kind of breathing motion with
dispersion and (partial) revivals. Calculations show that for some particular
preparations of the wave packet one can observe interesting effects in spin
motion, coming from inherent entanglement of spin and orbital degrees of
freedom. These effects manifest themselves through some oscillations in the
mean values of spin operators and through changes of spatial probability
density carried by upper and lower components of the wave function. It is also
shown that the characteristic time scale of predicted effects (called
$T_{\mathrm{ls}}$) is for radial wave packets much smaller than in other cases,
reaching values comparable to (or even less than) the time scale for the wave
packet revival.

quantum systems can give rise to correlations that are non-local, in the sense
that a Bell inequality is violated. They cannot, however, be used for
super-luminal signalling. It is also known that it is possible to write down
sets of ``super-quantum'' correlations that are more non-local than is allowed
by quantum mechanics, yet are still non-signalling. Viewed as an information
theoretic resource, super-quantum correlations are very powerful at reducing
the amount of communication needed for distributed computational tasks. An
intriguing question is why quantum mechanics does not allow these more powerful
correlations. We aim to shed light on the range of quantum possibilities by
placing them within a wider context. With this in mind, we investigate the set
of correlations that are constrained only by the no-signalling principle. These
correlations form a polytope, which contains the quantum correlations as a
(proper) subset. We determine the vertices of the no-signalling polytope in the
case that two observers each choose from two possible measurements with d
outcomes. We then consider how interconversions between different sorts of
correlations may be achieved. Finally, we consider some multipartite examples.

experimental trials show no states directly; they indicate properties of
probability distributions for outcomes. We prove categorically that probability
distributions leave open a choice of quantum states and operators and
particles, resolvable only by a move beyond logic, which, inspired or not, can
be characterized as a guess. By recognizing guesswork as inescapable in
choosing quantum states and particles, we free up the use of particles as
theoretical inventions by which to describe experiments with devices, and
thereby replace the postulate of state reductions by a theorem. By using the
freedom to invent probe particles in modeling light detection, we develop a
quantum model of the balancing of a light-induced force, with application to
models and detecting devices by which to better distinguish one source of weak
light from another. Finally, we uncover a symmetry between entangled states and
entangled detectors, a dramatic example of how the judgment about what light
state is generated by a source depends on choosing how to model the detector of
that light.

change the ``perturbation'', which causes a decay in the echo coherence. Two
different regimes are observed: First, a perturbative regime in which the decay
of echo coherence is non-monotonic and partial revivals of coherence are
observed. These revivals are more pronounced in traps with mixed dynamics as

perturbations, the decay becomes monotonic and independent of the strength of

of course, equivalent to the Schroedinger equation for the wavefunction, which
is linear. However, quite simple constraints on the canonical fields P and S
correspond to_nonlinear_ constraints on the wavefunction. Such constraints act
to prevent certain superpositions of wavefunctions from being realised, leading
to superselection-type rules. Examples leading to superselection for energy,
spin-direction and `classicality' are given. The canonical formulation of the

  One-Way Quantum Computation</title><description>  Quantum measurement is universal for quantum computation. Two models for
performing measurement-based quantum computation exist: the one-way quantum
computer was introduced by Briegel and Raussendorf, and quantum computation via
projective measurements only by Nielsen. The more recent development of this
second model is based on state transfers instead of teleportation. From this
development, a finite but approximate quantum universal family of observables
is exhibited, which includes only one two-qubit observable, while others are
one-qubit observables. In this article, an infinite but exact quantum universal
family of observables is proposed, including also only one two-qubit
observable.
  The rest of the paper is dedicated to compare these two models of
measurement-based quantum computation, i.e. one-way quantum computation and
quantum computation via projective measurements only. From this comparison,
which was initiated by Cirac and Verstraete, closer and more natural
connections appear between these two models. These close connections lead to a
unified view of measurement-based quantum computation.

by Land\'e and Popper. In this paper this problem is investigated, and a new
&quot;paradigm&quot; about the nature of dynamical and statistical laws is proposed. This
paradigm proposes some concepts which contrast with the usual intuitive view of
evolution and of physical law, such as: initial conditions could play no
privileged role in determining the evolution of the universe; the statistical
distribution of the particles emitted by a source could depend on the future
interactions of the particles; indeterministic trajectories can be defined by
the least action principle.
  This paradigm is applied to the analysis of the two-slit experiment and of
the EPR paradox, and a coherent picture for these phenomena is proposed; this
new picture shows how the well known difficulties in completing the quantum

character of de-Broglie--Bohm theory, the quantum potential, as the conformal
degree of freedom of the space--time metric. In this way, gravity should give
the causal structure of the space--time, while quantum phenomena determines the

past decade or two, as theoretical investigations of the possible impact of
quantum mechanical processes on computing have begun to make contact with
realizable experimental configurations. We demonstrate here that the observed
acceleration of the Universe can produce a universal limit on the total amount
of information that can be stored and processed in the future, putting an
ultimate limit on future technology for any civilization, including a
time-limit on Moore's Law. The limits we derive are stringent, and include the
possibilities that the computing performed is either distributed or local. A
careful consideration of the effect of horizons on information processing is
necessary for this analysis, which suggests that the total amount of
information that can be processed by any observer is significantly less than
the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy associated with the existence of an event
horizon in an accelerating universe.

  Hall Effects</title><description>  The paper examines the emergence of gauge fields during the evolution of a
particle with a spin that is described by a matrix Hamiltonian with n different
eigenvalues. It is shown that by introducing a spin gauge field a particle with
a spin can be described as a spin multiplet of scalar particles situated in a
non-Abelian pure gauge (forceless) field U(n). As the result, one can create a
theory of particle evolution that is gauge invariant with regards to the group
U^n(1). Due to this, in the adiabatic (Abelian) approximation the spin gauge
field is an analogue of n electromagnetic fields U(1) on the extended phase
space of the particle. These fields are force ones, and the forces of their
action enter the particle motion equations that are derived in the paper in the
general form. The motion equations describe the topological spin transport,
pumping and splitting. The Berry phase is represented in this theory
analogously to the Dirac phase of a particle in an electromagnetic field. Due
to the analogy with the electromagnetic field, the theory becomes natural in
the four-dimensional form. Besides the general theory the article considers a
number of important particular examples, both known and new.

ability to predict results of the complementary projective measurements
$\Pi_{S},\Pi'_{S}$ on the qubit $S$ from the projective measurements

finds that a small but finite non-decay probability persists at large times.
Generalization to scaling potentials of arbitrary shape is briefly indicated.

oscillating barrier causes the system to decay faster in general. However,
avoided crossings of metastable states can occur with the less stable states
crossing over to the more stable ones. If in the static well there exists a

adiabatically increasing the oscillating frequency of the barrier so that the

found that increasing the amplitude of the oscillating field may change a

is arbitrary. The sender and receiver are assumed to directly control several
spins each, with the sender encoding the message state onto the larger
state-space of her control spins. We show how to find the encoding that
maximises the fidelity of communication, using a simple method based on the
singular-value decomposition. Also, we show that this solution can be used to
increase communication fidelity in a rather different circumstance: where no
encoding of initial states is used, but where the sender and receiver control
exactly two spins each and vary the interactions on those spins over time. The
methods presented are computationally efficient, and numerical examples are
given for systems having up to 300 spins.

quantum operations are taken to be states of belief rather than states of

is to find a set of base vectors in every single-player strategy space and to
define their inner product so as to form them as a Hilbert space, and then form
a Hilbert space of system state. Basic ideas, concepts and formulas in Game
Theory have been reexpressed in such a space of system state. This space
provides more possible strategies than traditional classical game and
traditional quantum game. So besides those two games, more games have been
defined in different strategy spaces. All the games have been unified in the
new representation and their relation has been discussed. General Nash
Equilibrium for all the games has been proposed but without a general proof of
the existence. Besides the theoretical description, ideas and technics from
Statistical Physics, such as Kinetics Equation and Thermal Equilibrium can be
easily incorporated into Game Theory through such a representation. This
incorporation gives an endogenous method for refinement of Equilibrium State
and some hits to simplify the calculation of Equilibrium State. The more
privileges of this new representation depends on further application on more
theoretical and real games. Here, almost all ideas and conclusions are shown by
examples and argument, while, we wish, lately, we can give mathematical proof
for most results.

nuclei with accompanying photons emission is presented. The model is based on a
quantum mechanical one-particle model of alpha-decay through a decay barrier.
The bremsstrahlung spectrum calculation employs multipole expansion of the
vector potential of the Coulomb field of the daughter nucleus and takes into
account the dependence on the angle between the directions of the
alpha-particle propagation and the photon emission. Spectra of 210Po are
obtained for the angles 25 and 90, and the best agreement with the experimental
data in the 90 case in a comparison with other existing models is achieved.
  From the angular analysis, the model gives monotonic behavior of the
bremsstrahlung spectrum for any value of the angle. We find that sub-barrier
photon emission (i. e. bremsstrahlung photon emission during alpha-particle
tunneling through decay barrier) exists but gives a small contribution to the
total bremsstrahlung spectrum.

compared with the results obtained from its counterpart for a massive particle
by setting the mass equal to zero. Although similar, the present formulation
has some additional implications pertaining to the energy spectrum and the
associated free field quantization, particularly it yields zero vacuum energy.
The results are naturally extended to higher dimensions.

  Charges and Anomalies</title><description>  A simple quantum generalisation of the Liouville-Arnold criterion of
classical integrability is proposed: A system is quantum-integrable if it has
an abelian Lie group of Wigner symmetries of dimension equal to the number of
degrees of freedom. The criterion goes significantly beyond the familiar case
of involutive conserved operators to cover systems with anomalies in which
involutivity is modified by central charges. &quot;Anomalous&quot; quantum integrability
is shown to have all the expected consequences including exact
diagonalisability. The approach throws new light on the origin of Weyl group
invariance.

that is a quantum dynamical group are identified with the quantum state space.
Hermitian representation of the algebra are observables. The eigenvalue
equations for the representation of the set of Casimir invariant operators
define the field equations of the system.
  A general class of dynamical groups are semidirect products K *s N for which
the representations are given by Mackey's theory. The homogeneous group K must
be a subgroup of the automorphisms of the normal group N.
  The archetype dynamical group is the Poincare group. The field equations
defined by the representations of the Casimir operators define the basic
equations of physics; Klein-Gordon, Dirac, Maxwell and so forth.
  This paper explores a more general dynamical group candidate that is also a
semi-direct product but where the 'translation' normal subgroup N is now the
Heisenberg group.
  The relevant automorphisms of the Heisenberg group are the symplectic group.
This together with the requirement for an orthogonal metric leads to the
pseudo-unitary group for the homogeneous group K.
  The physical meaning and motivation of this group, called the quaplectic
group, is presented and the Hermitian irreducible representations of the
algebra are determined. As with the Poincare group, choice of the group defines
the Hilbert space of representations that are identified with quantum particle
states. The field equations that are the eigenvalue equations for the
representation of the Casimir operators, are obtained and investigated. The
theory embodies the Born reciprocity principle and a new relativity principle.

However, this does not necessarily lead to useful applications. To gauge the
practical significance of a quantum algorithm, one must weigh it against the
best conventional techniques applied to useful instances of the same problem.
Grover's quantum search algorithm is one of the most widely studied.
  We identify requirements for Grover's algorithm to be useful in practice: (1)
a search application S where classical methods do not provide sufficient
scalability; (2) an instantiation of Grover's algorithm Q(S) for S that has a
smaller asymptotic worst-case runtime than any classical algorithm C(S) for S;
(3) Q(S) with smaller actual runtime for practical instances of S than that of
any C(S).

bipartite settings, the study of other entanglement measures for multipartite
systems appears necessary. Here, connections between two other entanglement
measures--the relative entropy of entanglement and the geometric measure of
entanglement--are investigated. It is found that for arbitrary pure states the
latter gives rise to a lower bound on the former. For certain pure states, some
bipartite and some multipartite, this lower bound is saturated, and thus their
relative entropy of entanglement can be found analytically in terms of their
known geometric measure of entanglement. For certain mixed states, upper bounds
on the relative entropy of entanglement are also established. Numerical
evidence strongly suggests that these upper bounds are tight, i.e., they are
actually the relative entropy of entanglement.

generically produce bunched photons, because the same photon mode can be
populated by electrons decaying independently from a range of initial energies.
Photon antibunching becomes possible at frequencies close to the applied
voltage V, when the initial energy range of a decaying electron is restricted.
The condition for photon antibunching in a narrow frequency interval below V is
derived in terms of the eigenvalues T_n of the transmission matrix. This
condition is satisfied in a quantum point contact, where only a single T_n
differs from 0 or 1. The photon statistics is then a superposition of binomial

Einstein earlier view on the cosmological constant. In the equilibrium
Universes the value of the cosmological constant is regulated by matter. In the
empty Universe, the vacuum energy is exactly zero, lambda=0. The huge
contribution of the zero point motion of the quantum fields to the vacuum
energy is exactly cancelled by the higher-energy degrees of freedom of the
quantum vacuum. In the equilibrium Universes homogeneously filled by matter,
the vacuum is disturbed, and density of the vacuum energy becomes proportional
to the energy density of matter. This consideration applies to any equilibrium
vacuum irrespective of whether the vacuum is false or true, and is valid both
in the Einstein general theory of relativity and within the special theory of

quasi-exponential decay of the single-particle transition amplitude. It also
leads to strong localization of stationary many-particle states in a

during which {\it all} many-particle states remain strongly localized. We show
that, for any number of particles, this time exceeds the reciprocal frequency
of nearest-neighbor hopping by a factor $\sim 10^5$ already for a moderate

  Depolarization</title><description>  This paper presents a prepare-and-measure scheme using $N$-dimensional
quantum particles as information carriers where $N$ is a prime power. One of
the key ingredients used to resist eavesdropping in this scheme is to
depolarize all Pauli errors introduced to the quantum information carriers.
Using the Shor-Preskill-type argument, we prove that this scheme is
unconditionally secure against all attacks allowed by the laws of quantum
physics. For $N = 2^n &gt; 2$, each information carrier can be replaced by $n$
entangled qubits. In this case, there is a family of eavesdropping attacks on
which no unentangled-qubit-based prepare-and-measure quantum key distribution
scheme known to date can generate a provably secure key. In contrast, under the
same family of attacks, our entangled-qubit-based scheme remains secure
whenever $2^n \geq 4$. This demonstrates the advantage of using entangled
particles as information carriers and of using depolarization of Pauli errors
to combat eavesdropping attacks more drastic than those that can be handled by
unentangled-qubit-based prepare-and-measure schemes.

  Initial-Value Problems</title><description>  We deal with the problem, initiated in [8], of finding randomized and quantum
complexity of initial-value problems. We showed in [8] that a speed-up in both
settings over the worst-case deterministic complexity is possible. In the
present paper we prove, by defining new algorithms, that further improvement in
upper bounds on the randomized and quantum complexity can be achieved. In the
H\&quot;older class of right-hand side functions with r continuous bounded partial
derivatives, with r-th derivative being a H\&quot;older function with exponent \rho,
the \epsilon-complexity is shown to be O((1/\epsilon)^{1/(r+\rho+1/3)}) in the
randomized setting, and O((1/\epsilon)^{1/(r+\rho+1/2)}) on a quantum computer
(up to logarithmic factors). This is an improvement for the general problem
over the results from [8]. The gap still remaining between upper and lower
bounds on the complexity is further discussed for a special problem. We
consider scalar autonomous problems, with the aim of computing the solution at
the end point of the interval of integration. For this problem, we fill up the
gap by establishing (essentially) matching upper and lower complexity bounds.
We show that the complexity in this case is of order
(1/\epsilon)^{1/(r+\rho+1/2)} in the randomized setting, and
(1/\epsilon)^{1/(r+\rho+1)} in the quantum setting (again up to logarithmic
factors).

master equation. The corresponding Fokker-Planck equation for the Q-function is
then solved employing a propagator method developed in Ref. \cite{1}. Making
use of this Q-function, we calculate the quadrature fluctuations of the optical

permits one to choose the operating wavelengths for each photon of a pair based

particularly well-suited for a distributed quantum information processing

brief discussion of Richardson's early work, which demonstrated the exact
solvability of the pure pairing model, and then show how that work has evolved
recently into a much richer class of exactly-solvable models. We then show how
the Richardson solution leads naturally to an exact analogy between such
quantum models and classical electrostatic problems in two dimensions. This is
then used to demonstrate formally how BCS theory emerges as the large-N limit
of the pure pairing Hamiltonian and is followed by several applications to
problems of relevance to condensed matter physics, nuclear physics and the
physics of confined systems. Some of the interesting effects that are discussed
in the context of these exactly-solvable models include: (1) the crossover from
superconductivity to a fluctuation-dominated regime in small metallic grains,
(2) the role of the nucleon Pauli principle in suppressing the effects of high
spin bosons in interacting boson models of nuclei, and (3) the possibility of
fragmentation in confined boson systems. Interesting insight is also provided
into the origin of the superconducting phase transition both in two-dimensional
electronic systems and in atomic nuclei, based on the electrostatic image of

Both deterministic and random potentials are considered. The dependence of the
reflection coefficient and localization length on the amplitude and the

that perturbation and WKB theories are inconsistent in the above-barrier
backscattering problem. Not only the solutions but the regions of validity of
both methods as well depend strongly on the details of the potential profile,
and are individual for each potential. A simple criterion that allows

quantum one-particle scattering process and the corresponding state are
described by an indivisible wave packet to move as a whole at all stages of
scattering, then they are elementary; otherwise, they are combined; each
combined process consists from several alternative elementary ones to proceed
simultaneously; the corresponding (normed) state can be uniquely presented as
the sum of elementary ones whose (constant) norms give unit, in sum; Born's
formula intended for calculating the {\it expectation} values of physical
observables, as well as the standard timing procedure are valid only for
elementary states and processes; only an elementary time-dependent state can be
considered as the quantum counterpart to some classical one-particle rajectory.
By our approach, tunneling a non-relativistic particle through a static
one-dimensional potential barrier is a combined process consisting from two
elementary ones, transmission and reflection. In the standard setting of the
problem, we find an unique pair of solutions to the Schr\&quot;odinger equation,
which describe separately transmission and reflection. On this basis we
introduce (exact and asymptotic) characteristic times for transmission and
reflection.

entanglement purification protocol in purifying one Bell state from a finite
block of five Bell states. The main issue to be concerned with in the theory of
such an error-correction is to create specific linear Boolean functions that
can transform the sixteen error syndromes occurring in the error-correcting
code onto their mappings so that one Bell state is corrected whenever the other
four in the finite block are measured. The Boolean function is performed under
the effect of its associated sequence of basic quantum unilateral and bilateral
operations. Previously, the Boolean function is created in use of the Monte
Carlo computer search method. We introduce here a systematic scenario for
creating the Boolean function and its associated sequence of operations so that
we can do the job in an analytical way without any trial and error effort.
Consequently, all possible Boolean functions can in principle be created by
using our method. Furthermore, for a deduced Boolean function, we can also in
the spirit of our method derive its best associated sequence of operations
which may contain the least number of total operations or the least number of
the bilateral XOR operations alone. Some results obtained in this work show the
capability of our method in creating the Boolean function and its sequence of

inequivalent to, though arguably empirically indistinguishable from, the usual
one. The mathematical core of this viewpoint is however rather independent of

one to purify all two colorable graph states, a class of states which includes
e.g. cluster states, GHZ states and codewords of various error correction
codes. The schemes include both recurrence protocols and hashing protocols. We
analyze these schemes under realistic conditions and observe for a generic
error model that the threshold value for imperfect local operations depends on
the structure of the corresponding interaction graph, but is otherwise
independent of the number of parties. The qualitative behavior can be
understood from an analytically solvable model which deals only with a
restricted class of errors. We compare direct multiparticle entanglement
purification protocols with schemes based on bipartite entanglement
purification and show that the direct multiparticle entanglement purification
is more efficient and the achievable fidelity of the purified states is larger.
We also show that the purification protocol allows one to produce private
entanglement, an important aspect when using the produced entangled states for
secure applications. Finally we discuss an experimental realization of a
multiparty purification protocol in optical lattices which is issued to improve
the fidelity of cluster states created in such systems.

we construct a phenomenological skyrmion-type potential to study this narrow

interactions. This is achieved by a generalization of first quantization, where
the Maxwell equations are interpreted as the electromagnetic component of the
Schroedinger equation. This picture is complemented by the consideration of
electrons and photons as real particles in three-dimensional space, following
guiding conditions derived from the particle-wave-functions to which they are
associated. The guiding condition for the electron is taken from Bohmian
mechanics, while the photon velocity is defined as the ratio between the
Poynting vector and the electromagnetic energy density. The case of many
particles is considered, taking into account their statistical properties. The
formalism is applied to a two level system, providing a satisfactory
description for spontaneous emission, Lamb shift, scattering, absorption,
dispersion, resonance fluorescence and vacuum fields. This model adequately
describes quantum jumps by the entanglement between the photon and the atomic
system and it will prove to be very useful in the simulation of quantum devices
for quantum computers and quantum information systems. A possible relativistic
generalization is presented, together with its relationship to QED.

qualitatively all the imaging properties of the entangled beams, even in ways
which up to now were not believed possible. A key feature is that these

currently available in the literature, these are complicated polynomials in 6j

by means of the Elliot -- Biedenharn identity one can get rid of all the 6j
symbols for any valence of the gauge invariant vertex, thus immensely reducing
the computational effort. We use the resulting compact formula to study
numerically the spectrum of the gauge invariant 4 -- vertex. The techniques

completely separable, so both the toroidal Fourier harmonic index n and the
poloidal index m are good quantum numbers. The full spectrum of eigenvalues for
m in the range 1 to m_max is analyzed quantitatively, using asymptotics for
large m, numerics for all m, and graphics for qualitative understanding. The
density of eigenvalues scales like the square of m_max for large m_max. Because
finite-m corrections scale inversely as the square of m_max, their inclusion is
essential in order to obtain the correct statistics for the distribution of
eigenvalues. Near the largest growth rate only a single radial eigenmode
contributes to the spectrum, so the eigenvalues there depend only on m and n,
as in a two-dimensional system. However, unlike the generic separable
two-dimensional system, the statistics of the ideal-MHD spectrum departs
somewhat from the Poisson distribution, even for arbitrarily large m_max. This
departure from Poissonian statistics may be understood qualitatively from the

propose an implementation of quantum computation using coherent states of the
vibrational modes of trapped ions. Differently from earlier experiments, we
consider a far-off resonance for the interaction between external fields and
the ion in a bidimensional trap. By appropriate choices of the detunings
between the external fields, the adiabatic elimination of the ionic excited
level from the Hamiltonian of the system allows for beam splitting between
orthogonal vibrational modes, production of coherent states and non-linear
interactions of various kinds. In particular, this model enables the generation
of the four coherent Bell states. Furthermore, all the necessary operations for
quantum computation such as preparation of qubits, one-qubit and controlled
two-qubit operations, are possible. The detection of the state of a vibrational
mode in a Bell state is made possible by the combination of resonant and
off-resonant interactions between the ion and some external fields. We show
that our read-out scheme provides highly efficient discrimination between all
the four Bell states. We extend this to a quantum register composed of many
individually trapped ions. In this case, operations on two remote qubits are
possible through a cavity mode. We emphasize that our remote-qubit operation
scheme does not require a high quality factor resonator: the cavity field acts
as a catalyst for the gate operation.

  It is argued that Bell's theorem disallowing the violation of Bell's
inequality within a local hidden-variable theory depends on the DV's having a

high temperatures. I analyze multipartite entanglement produced by the $\eta$
pairing mechanism which features strongly in the fermionic lattice models of
high $T_c$ superconductivity. This problem is shown to be equivalent to
calculating multipartite entanglement in totally symmetric states of qubits. I
demonstrate that we can conclusively calculate the relative entropy of
entanglement within any subset of qubits in an overall symmetric state. Three
main results then follow. First, I show that the condition for
superconductivity, namely the existence of the off diagonal long range order
(ODLRO), is not dependent on two-site entanglement, but on just classical
correlations as the sites become more and more distant. Secondly, the
entanglement that does survive in the thermodynamical limit is the entanglement
of the total lattice and, at half filling, it scales with the log of the number
of sites. It is this entanglement that will exist at temperatures below the
superconducting critical temperature, which can currently be as high as 160
Kelvin. Thirdly, I prove that a complete mixture of symmetric states does not
contain any entanglement in the macroscopic limit. On the other hand, the same
mixture of symmetric states possesses the same two qubit entanglement features
as the pure states involved, in the sense that the mixing does not destroy
entanglement for finite number of qubits, albeit it does decrease it. Maximal
mixing of symmetric states also does not destroy ODLRO and classical
correlations. I discuss various other inequalities between different
entanglements as well as generalizations to the subsystems of any
dimensionality (i.e. higher than spin half).

quantum field theory. This is defined as the von Neumann entropy S_A=-Tr rho_A
log rho_A corresponding to the reduced density matrix rho_A of a subsystem A.
For the case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a
conformal field theory with central charge c, we re-derive the result
S_A\sim(c/3) log(l) of Holzhey et al. when A is a finite interval of length l
in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems,finite
temperatures, and when A consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals.
For such a system away from its critical point, when the correlation length \xi
is large but finite, we show that S_A\sim{\cal A}(c/6)\log\xi, where \cal A is
the number of boundary points of A. These results are verified for a free
massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz for the
case of finite-size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models,
such as the Ising and XXZ models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix
methods. Finally the free-field results are extended to higher dimensions, and
used to motivate a scaling form for the singular part of the entanglement
entropy near a quantum phase transition.

in classical mechanical terms. It is believed to be one characteristic of
superconductivity. The quantum state constructed by eta-pairing which
demonstrates ODLRO is an eigenstate of the three-dimensional Hubbard model.
Entanglement is a key concept of the quantum information processing and has no
classical counterpart. We study the entanglement property of eta-pairing
quantum state. The concurrence is a well-known measure of quantum entanglement.
We show that the concurrence of entanglement between one-site and the rest
sites is exactly the correlation function of the ODLRO for the eta-pairing
state in the thermodynamic limit. So, when the eta-pairing state is entangled,
it demonstrates ODLRO and is thus in superconducting phase, if it is a
separable state, there is no ODLRO. In the thermodynamic limit, the
entanglement between M-site and other sites of the eta-pairing state does not
vanish. Other types of ODLRO of eta-pairing state are presented. We show that
the behavior of the ODLRO correlation functions is equivalent to that of the
entanglement of the eta-pairing state. The scaling of the entropy of the
entanglement for the eta-pairing state is studied.

CFT/FRW-cosmology relation, we derive the self-gravitational corrections to the
first Friedmann-like equation which is the equation of the brane motion. The
additional term that arises due to the semiclassical analysis can be viewed as
stiff matter where the self-gravitational corrections act as the source for it.
This result is contrary to standard analysis that regards the charge of SdS_5
bulk black hole as the source for stiff matter. Furthermore, we rewrite the
Friedmann-like equation in a such way that it represents the conservation
equation of energy of a point particle moving in a one-dimensional effective
potential. The self-gravitational corrections to the effective potential and,
consequently, to the point particle's motion are obtained. A short analysis on
the asymptotic behavior of the 4-dimensional brane is presented.

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 (22), 5188-5191 (2001)] shows that it is possible to
quantum compute using only a fixed entangled resource known as a cluster state,
and adaptive single-qubit measurements. This model is the basis for several
practical proposals for quantum computation, including a promising proposal for
optical quantum computation based on cluster states [M. A. Nielsen,
arXiv:quant-ph/0402005, accepted to appear in Phys. Rev. Lett.]. A significant
open question is whether such proposals are scalable in the presence of
physically realistic noise. In this paper we prove two threshold theorems which
show that scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation may be achieved in
implementations based on cluster states, provided the noise in the
implementations is below some constant threshold value. Our first threshold
theorem applies to a class of implementations in which entangling gates are
applied deterministically, but with a small amount of noise. We expect this
threshold to be applicable in a wide variety of physical systems. Our second
threshold theorem is specifically adapted to proposals such as the optical
cluster-state proposal, in which non-deterministic entangling gates are used. A
critical technical component of our proofs is two powerful theorems which
relate the properties of noisy unitary operations restricted to act on a
subspace of state space to extensions of those operations acting on the entire
state space.

  in quantum mechanics and their relation</title><description>  We discuss the particle method in quantum mechanics which provides an exact
scheme to calculate the time-dependent wavefunction from a single-valued
continuum of trajectories where two spacetime points are linked by at most a
single orbit. A natural language for the theory is offered by the hydrodynamic
analogy, in which wave mechanics corresponds to the Eulerian picture and the
particle theory to the Lagrangian picture. The Lagrangian model for the quantum
fluid may be developed from a variational principle. The Euler-Lagrange
equations imply a fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation to
calculate the trajectories of the fluid particles as functions of their initial
coordinates using as input the initial wavefunction. The admissible solutions
are those consistent with quasi-potential flow. The effect of the superposition
principle is represented via a nonclassical force on each particle. The
wavefunction is computed via the standard map between the Lagrangian
coordinates and the Eulerian fields, which provides the analogue in this model
of Huygens principle in wave mechanics. The method is illustrated by
calculating the time-dependence of a free Gaussian wavefunction. The Eulerian
and Lagrangian pictures are complementary descriptions of a quantum process in
that they have associated Hamiltonian formulations that are connected by a
canonical transformation. The de Broglie-Bohm interpretation, which employs the
same set of trajectories, should not be conflated with the Lagrangian version
of the hydrodynamic interpretation. The theory implies that the mathematical
results of the de Broglie-Bohm model may be regarded as statements about
quantum mechanics itself rather than about its interpretation.

operator of relativistic quantum theory, which is valid for all values of the
spin. We focus on the spin 1/2 case, considering a few simple yet solvable and
physically interesting cases, in order to understand how to interpret the
operator. Our general representation is uniquely determined by the Green's
function for the corresponding Schrodinger equation. We find that, in general,
the operator has a representation as a nonlocal composite of (at least) three
singularities. In the standard interpretation, the particle component has two
negative parts and one (hard core) positive part, while the antiparticle
component has two positive parts and one (hard core) negative part. This effect
is confined within a Compton wavelength such that, at the point of singularity,
they cancel each other providing a finite result. Furthermore, the operator
looks like the identity outside a few Compton wavelengths (cutoff). To our
knowledge, this is the first example of a physically relevant operator with
these properties.

full (minimal coupling) Dirac equation into particle and antiparticle
components. The diagonalization is analytic in that it is achieved without
transforming the wave functions, as is done by the Foldy-Wouthuysen method, and
reveals the nonlocal time behavior of the particle-antiparticle relationship.
We interpret the zitterbewegung and the result that a velocity measurement (of
a Dirac particle) at any instant in time is, as reflections of the fact that
the Dirac equation makes a spatially extended particle appear as a point in the
present by forcing it to oscillate between the past and future at speed c. From
this we infer that, although the form of the Dirac equation serves to make
space and time appear on an equal footing mathematically, it is clear that they
are still not on an equal footing from a physical point of view. On the other
hand, the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation, which connects the Dirac and square
root operator, is unitary. Reflection on these results suggests that a more
refined notion (than that of unitary equivalence) may be required for physical
systems.

of {\it environment - assisted invariance} or {\it envariance}, a recently
discovered symmetry exhibited by entangled quantum systems. Envariance of
perfectly entangled ``Bell-like'' states can be used to rigorously justify
complete ignorance of the observer about the outcome of any measurement on
either of the members of the entangled pair. For more general states,
envariance leads to Born's rule, $p_k \propto |\psi_k|^2$ for the outcomes
associated with Schmidt states. Probabilities derived in this manner are an
objective reflection of the underlying state of the system -- they represent
experimentally verifiable symmetries, and not just a subjective ``state of
knowledge'' of the observer. Envariance - based approach is compared with and
found superior to pre-quantum definitions of probability including the {\it
standard definition} based on the `principle of indifference' due to Laplace,
and the {\it relative frequency approach} advocated by von Mises. Implications
of envariance for the interpretation of quantum theory go beyond the derivation
of Born's rule: Envariance is enough to establish dynamical independence of

via a recently-developed global measure suitable for generic quantum many-body
systems. The entanglement surface is determined over the phase diagram, and
found to exhibit structure richer than expected. Near the critical line, the
entanglement is peaked (albeit analytically), consistent with the notion that
entanglement--the non-factorization of wave functions--reflects quantum
correlations. Singularity does, however, accompany the critical line, as
revealed by the divergence of the field-derivative of the entanglement along
the line. The form of this singularity is dictated by the universality class
controlling the quantum phase transition.

  influence of real conditions</title><description>  The Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a metal wall is
investigated under the influence of real conditions including the dynamic
polarizability of the atom, finite conductivity of the wall metal and nonzero
temperature of the system. Both analytical and numerical results for the free
energy and force are obtained over a wide range of the atom-wall distances.
Numerical computations are performed for an Au wall and metastable
He${}^{\ast}$, Na and Cs atoms. For the He${}^{\ast}$ atom we demonstrate, as
an illustration, that at short separations of about the Au plasma wavelength at
room temperature the free energy deviates up to 35% and the force up to 57%
from the classical Casimir-Polder result. Accordingly, such large deviations
should be taken into account in precision experiments on atom-wall
interactions. The combined account of different corrections to the
Casimir-Polder interaction leads to the conclusion that at short separations
the corrections due to the dynamic polarizability of an atom play a more
important role than -- and suppress -- the corrections due to the nonideality
of the metal wall. By the comparison of the exact atomic polarizabilities with
those in the framework of the single oscillator model, it is shown that the
obtained asymptotic expressions enable calculation of the free energy and force
for the atom-wall interaction under real conditions with a precision of one
percent.

contrived. It also offers some suggestions as to how we might modify
renormalization methods to make them more successful. We then discuss some

mode of operation. The approach of a first principle quantum heat engine toward
this stable limit cycle is studied. The engine is based on a working medium
consisting of an ensemble of quantum systems composed of two coupled spins. A
four stroke cycle of operation is studied, with two {\em isochore} branches
where heat is transferred from the hot/cold baths and two {\em adiabats} where
work is exchanged. The dynamics is generated by a completely positive map. It
has been shown that the performance of this model resembles an engine with
intrinsic friction. The quantum conditional entropy is employed to prove the
monotonic approach to a limit cycle. Other convex measures, such as the quantum
distance display the same monotonic approach. The equations of motion of the
engine are solved for the different branches and are combined to a global
propagator that relates the state of the engine in the beginning of the cycle
to the state after one period of operation of the cycle. The eigenvalues of the
propagator define the rate of relaxation toward the limit cycle. A longitudinal
and transverse mode of approach to the limit cycle is identified. The entropy
balance is used to explore the necessary conditions which lead to a stable
limit cycle. The phenomena of friction can be identified with a zero change in
the von Neumann entropy of the working medium.

N-spin system with N&gt;&gt;1. Here, a quantum state is said to be macroscopically
entangled if it is a superposition of macroscopically distinct states. To judge
whether such superposition is hidden in a general state, we use an essentially
unique index p: A pure state is macroscopically entangled if p=2, whereas it
may be entangled but not macroscopically if p&lt;2. This index is directly related
to the stability of the state. We calculate the index p for various states in
which magnons are excited with various densities and wavenumbers. We find
macroscopically entangled states (p=2) as well as states with p=1. The former
states are unstable in the sense that they are unstable against some local
measurements. On the other hand, the latter states are stable in the senses
that they are stable against local measurements and that their decoherence
rates never exceed O(N) in any weak classical noises. For comparison, we also
calculate the von Neumann entropy S(N) of a subsystem composed of N/2 spins as
a measure of bipartite entanglement. We find that S(N) of some states with p=1
is of the same order of magnitude as the maximum value N/2. On the other hand,
S(N) of the macroscopically entangled states with p=2 is as small as O(log N)&lt;&lt;
N/2. Therefore, larger S(N) does not mean more instability. We also point out
that these results are analogous to those for interacting many bosons.
Furthermore, the origin of the huge entanglement, as measured either by p or
S(N), is discussed to be due to the spatial propagation of magnons.

discrete time dynamics, such that the time step commutes with lattice
translations and has strictly finite propagation speed. In contrast to earlier
definitions this allows us to give an explicit characterization of all local
rules generating such automata. The same local rules also generate the global
time step for automata with periodic boundary conditions. Our main structure
theorem asserts that any quantum cellular automaton is structurally reversible,
i.e., that it can be obtained by applying two blockwise unitary operations in a
generalized Margolus partitioning scheme. This implies that, in contrast to the
classical case, the inverse of a nearest neighbor quantum cellular automaton is
again a nearest neighbor automaton.
  We present several construction methods for quantum cellular automata, based
on unitaries commuting with their translates, on the quantization of
(arbitrary) reversible classical cellular automata, on quantum circuits, and on
Clifford transformations with respect to a description of the single cells by
finite Weyl systems. Moreover, we indicate how quantum random walks can be
considered as special cases of cellular automata, namely by restricting a
quantum lattice gas automaton with local particle number conservation to the
single particle sector.

the relevant test space, the set of orthonormal bases of a Hilbert space,

multi-parties. Explicit expressions for the shared secret bit is given. It is
shown that in the Hillery-Bu\v{z}ek-Berthiaume quantum secret sharing scheme
the secret information is shared in the parity of binary strings formed by the
measured outcomes of the participants. In addition, we have increased the
efficiency of the quantum secret sharing scheme by generalizing two techniques
from quantum key distribution. The favored-measuring-basis Quantum secret
sharing scheme is developed from the Lo-Chau-Ardehali technique[H. K. Lo, H. F.
Chau and M. Ardehali, quant-ph/0011056] where all the participants choose their
measuring-basis asymmetrically, and the measuring-basis-encrypted Quantum

Hwang, I. G. Koh and Y. D. Han, Phys. Lett. A244, 489 (1998)] where all
participants choose their measuring-basis according to a control key. Both
schemes are asymptotically 100% in efficiency, hence nearly all the GHZ-states
in a quantum secret sharing process are used to generate shared secret
information.

also the projection lattice of a Hilbert space. As the latter example
illustrates, a lattice-ordered TOA need not be a topological lattice. However,
we show that a compact Boolean TOA is a topological Boolean algebra. Using
this, we prove that any compact regular TOA is atomistic, and has a compact
center. We prove also that any compact TOA with isolated 0 is of finite height.
We then focus on stably ordered TOAs: those in which the upper-set generated by
an open set is open. These include both topological orthomodular lattices and
interval orthoalgebras -- in particular, projection lattices. We show that the
topology of a compact stably-ordered TOA with isolated 0 is determined by that

depends on unknown parameters, then the distribution of the outcome depends on
these parameters too, and statistical inference problems result. Often one has
a choice of what measurement to take, corresponding to different experimental
set-ups or settings of measurement apparatus. This leads to a design
problem--which measurement is best for a given statistical problem. This paper
gives an introduction to this field in the most simple of settings, that of
estimating the state of a spin-half particle given n independent copies of the
particle. We show how in some cases asymptotically optimal measurements can be
constructed. Other cases present interesting open problems, connected to the
fact that for some models, quantum Fisher information is in some sense
non-additive. In physical terms, we have non-locality without entanglement.

help of a quantum computer. A state of qubits (realized, e.g., with photons) is
transmitted through a quantum channel to the addressee, who applies a quantum
computer tuned to realize the inverse unitary transformation decoding of the
message. Different ways of eavesdropping are considered, and an estimate of the
time needed for determining the secret unitary transformation is given. It is
shown that using even small quantum computers can serve as a basis for very
efficient cryptographic protocols. For a suggested cryptographic protocol, the
time scale on which communication can be considered secure is exponential in
the number of qubits in the entangled states and in the number of gates used to
construct the quantum network.

by a bath of many spins 1/2. By carefully adjusting parameters, the dynamical
regime of the bath has been varied from quantum chaos to regular, while all
other dynamical characteristics have been kept practically intact. We
explicitly demonstrate that for a many-body quantum bath, the onset of quantum
chaos leads to significantly faster and stronger decoherence compared to an
equivalent non-chaotic bath. Moreover, the non-diagonal elements of the
system's density matrix decay differently for chaotic and non-chaotic baths.
Therefore, knowledge of the basic parameters of the bath (strength of the
system-bath interaction, bath's spectral density of states) is not always
sufficient, and much finer details of the bath's dynamics can strongly affect
the decoherence process.

It is
demonstrated that the resonant current displays quantum interference effects
due to a possibility of tunneling through different levels. We show that the
interference effects are strongly modulated by a relative phase of states
carrying the current. This makes it possible to use these effects for measuring
the phase difference between resonant states in quantum dots. We extend our
model for a description of magnetotransport through the Zeeman doublets. It is
shown that, due to spin-flip transitions, the quantum interference effects
generate a distinct peak in the shot-noise power spectrum at the frequency of
Zeeman splitting. This mechanism explains modulation in the tunneling current
at the Larmor frequency observed in scanning tunneling microscope experiments

two media, in which a photon travels at different velocities, undergoes a
momentum change according to the law of conservation of momentum. The momentum
of the photon is transferred locally to the medium, and the boundary between
the media receives stress, which determines the photon trajectory. An

electric charge. We are able to detect the electric charge after the detection
of the photon on the screen, and control the sensitivity of photon detection.
By means of this proposed experiment it is determined whether or not an attempt

experimental verification with methods from quantum optics and atomic physics.
However, we argue that the predicted decoherence is unobservable in such
experiments if it acts globally on the whole experimental setup. This is
related to the unobservability of the global phase in interference. We also
show how local energy decoherence, which acts separately on system and phase
reference, could be detected with remarkable sensitivity and over a wide range
of length scales by long-distance Ramsey interferometry with metastable atomic
states. The sensitivity of the experiments can be further enhanced using
multi-atom entanglement.

accomplished through the use of distribution functions. This is useful for both
fundamental investigations such as the nature of the quantum-classical
transition as well as for applications such as quantum feedback control. By
affording a clear separation between kinematical and dynamical quantum effects,
the Wigner distribution is particularly valuable in this regard. Here we
discuss some consequences of the fact that when closed-system classical and
quantum dynamics are treated in Gaussian approximation, they are in fact
identical. Thus, it follows that several results in the so-called `semiquantum'
chaos actually arise from approximating the classical, and not the quantum
dynamics. (Similarly, opposing claims of quantum suppression of chaos are also
suspect.) As a simple byproduct of the analysis we are able to show how the
Lyapunov exponent appears in the language of phase space distributions in a way
that clearly underlines the difference between quantum and classical dynamical
situations. We also informally discuss some aspects of approximations that go
beyond the Gaussian approximation, such as the issue of when quantum nonlinear
dynamical corrections become important compared to nonlinear classical
corrections.

a dielectric function given by the Drude model, and the radius of the sphere is
small compared to the corresponding plasma wavelength. The half-space is also
described by the same model, but with a different plasma frequency. We find
that in the retarded limit, the force is quasi-oscillatory. This leads to the
prediction of stable equilibrium points at which the sphere could levitate in
the Earth's gravitational field. This seems to lead to the possibility of an
experimental test of the model. The effects of finite temperature on the force
are also studied, and found to be rather small at room temperature. However,
thermally activated transitions between equilibrium points could be significant
at room temperature.

coupling to a charge qubit. The stationary oscillator state exhibits a reduced

of the excited state population. Furthermore, by extending this measurement
procedure a complete quantum state tomography of the resonator state can be
performed. This provides a universal tool to detect a large variety of
different states and to prove the quantum nature of a nanomechanical

polarons. The method generalizes that introduced by S. Fratini,P.\
Qu{\'{e}}merais [Mod. Phys. Lett. B {\bf 12} 1003 (1998)]. We take into account
the Wigner crystal normal modes rather than a single mean frequency in the
minimization procedure of the variational free energy. We calculate the
renormalized modes of the crystal as well as the charge polarization
correlation function and polaron radius. The solid phase boundaries are
determined via a Lindemann criterion, suitably generalized to take into account
the classical-to-quantum cross-over.
  In the weak electron-phonon coupling limit, the Wigner crystal parameters are
renormalized by the electron-phonon interaction leading to a stabilization of
the solid phase for low polarizability of the medium. Conversely, at
intermediate and strong coupling, the behavior of the system depends strongly
on the polarizability of the medium.
  For weakly polarizable media, a density crossover occurs inside the solid
phase when the renormalized plasma frequency approaches the phonon frequency.
At low density, we have a renormalized polaron Wigner crystal, while at higher
densities the electron-phonon interaction is weakened irrespective of the {\it
bare} electron-phonon coupling.
  For strongly polarizable media, the system behaves as a Lorentz lattice of
dipoles. The abrupt softening of the internal polaronic frequency predicted by
Fratini and Quemerais is observed near the actual melting point only at very
strong coupling, leading to a possible liquid polaronic phase for a wider range
of parameters.

Schroedinger equation with an attractive inverse-square potential, as shown by
Efimov. The resulting oscillatory behaviour controls the renormalisation of the
three-body interactions, with the renormalisation-group flow tending to a limit
cycle as the cut-off is lowered. The approach used here leads to single-valued
potentials with discontinuities as the bound states are cut off. The
perturbations around the cycle start with a marginal term whose effect is
simply to change the phase of the short-distance oscillations, or the
self-adjoint extension of the singular Hamiltonian. The full power counting in

appears now as a restricted class of initial conditions. [M. de Haan and C.
George. Prog. Theor. Phys.,109, 881-909 (2003)] This program is realized here
in the reduced formalism for a scalar field, interacting with a two-level atom,
beyond the usual rotating wave approximation. The kinetic evolution operator,
previously surmised, [M. de Haan. Physica, A171 (1991), 159] is here derived
from first principles, justifying the usual practice in optics where the common
use of the so-called pole approximation should no longer be viewed as an
approximation but as an alternative description in the appropriate formalism.
That model illustrates how some dressing of the atomic levels (and vertices),
through an appropriate operator, finds its place naturally into the new
formalism since the bare and dressed ground states do no longer coincide.
Moreover, finite velocity for field propagation is now possible in all cases,
without the presence of precursors for multiple detections.

identifies the ion in its upper ``bright'' state. The lower ``dark'' ion state

events represent the straightforward demonstration of the quantum Zeno paradox.
Also, high probability of survival was demonstrated when the ion, driven by a

limitations of the variational method and the perturbation theory.The results

Uniformly accurate results are obtained for the case of the quartic-,sextic-

methods using different input assumptions.The results for the sextic

Quite unexpected behaviours are obtained. In particular, we find that when the
initial wave packet is fully localized in space, the $J_{z}$ angular momentum
component is frozen; this is an interesting example of an observable which,
although it is not a constant of motion, has a constant expectation value. For
a non-completely localized wave packet, the effect still occurs although less
pronounced, and the spin keeps for ever memory of its initial state. Generally
speaking, as time goes on, the spatial density profile looks rather complex, as
a consequence of the competition between drift and precession, and displays
various shapes according to the ratio between the Larmor period and the
characteristic time of flight. The density profile gradually changes from a
multimodal quickly moving distribution when the scatttering rate is small, to a
unimodal standing but flattening distribution in the opposite cas case.

qubits coupled via nearest neighbor interactions. The entanglement measure used
is the n-concurrence, which is distinct from other measures on spin chains such
as bipartite entanglement in that it can quantify &quot;global&quot; entanglement across
the spin chain. Specifically, it computes the overlap of a quantum state with
its time-reversed state. As such this measure is well suited to study ground
states of spin chain Hamiltonians that are intrinsically time reversal
symmetric. We study the robustness of n-concurrence of ground states when the
interaction is subject to a time reversal antisymmetric magnetic field
perturbation. The n-concurrence in the ground state of the isotropic XX model
is computed and it is shown that there is a critical magnetic field strength at
which the entanglement experiences a jump discontinuity from the maximum value
to zero. The n-concurrence for thermal mixed states is derived and a threshold
temperature is computed below which the system has non zero entanglement.

bosons forming a Bose-Einsten condensate. The expression for energy radiated
consists of two terms in this case. One of them, the larger one in the limit of
large numbers of Bosons in the state, is proportional to the number of bosons
squared and has the same form as one obtains in a hydrodynamic model of quantum
wave mechanics. This term is sensitive to the size and shape of the wave packet
especially when the force field causing acceleration is localized in extent.
The second term, identical to the single particle scattering formula, is less
sensitive to the wave packet size and shape and is proportional to the number
of bosons in the condensate. The conclusion is that for a Bose-Einstein
condensate the radiated bremsstrahlung is a sensitive function of the wave
packet shape which is quite different than for a beam of incoherent particles
which do not show very much dependence on the wave packet. Only lowest order
radiation is calculated. It is also found that to lowest order there does not
exist any situation in which the radiation loss from a coherent state of bosons
vanishes completely, so that there is no analog of superconductivity in a
particle beam of this type at least within the net of assumptions made in this
paper. The amount of radiation can be greatly suppressed however, as it is a
sensitive function of the form of the wave function.

data input and output, along with a control input that partly influences, and a
control output that partly reveals, which of a set of unitary evolutions the
data undergoes en route from input to output. The channel is designed so that
the data's evolution can be exactly inferred by a classically coordinated

the control input, but not from either of these resources alone. Thus a two-way
classical side channel allows the otherwise noisy evolution of the data to be
corrected, greatly increasing the capacity. The same family of channels
provides examples where the classical capacity assisted by classical feedback,
$C_B$, and the quantum capacity assisted by classical feedback $Q_B$, both

interacting with the control input, has a classical capacity $C=C_H$ strictly

channel described by the map E based on incomplete measurements. In a
particular case of a qubit channel a complete reconstruction of the map E can
be performed via complete tomography of four output states E[rho_j ] that
originate from a set of four linearly independent test states j (j = 1, 2, 3,
4) at the input of the channel. We study the situation when less than four
linearly independent states are transmitted via the channel and measured at the
output. We present strategies how to reconstruct the channel when just one, two
or three states are transmitted via the channel. In particular, we show that if
just one state is transmitted via the channel then the best reconstruction can
be achieved when this state is a total mixture described by the density
operator rho = I/2. To improve the reconstruction procedure one has to send via
the channel more states. The best strategy is to complement the total mixture
with pure states that are mutually orthogonal in the sense of the Bloch-sphere
representation. We show that unitary transformations (channels) can be uniquely
reconstructed (determined) based on the information of how three properly
chosen input states are transformed under the action of the channel.

between the phase-averaged tomographic reconstructions of the Wigner function
as obtained from the measured density-matrix elements and from a direct Abel

Bell in 1987, we arrive
at a relativistic version of the Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber (GRW) model of
spontaneous wavefunction collapse. The GRW model was proposed as a solution of
the measurement problem of quantum mechanics and involves a stochastic and
nonlinear modification of the Schr\&quot;odinger equation. It deviates very little
from the Schr\&quot;odinger equation for microscopic systems but efficiently
suppresses, for macroscopic systems, superpositions of macroscopically
different states. As suggested by Bell, we take the primitive ontology, or
local beables, of our model to be a discrete set of space-time points, at which
the collapses are centered. This set is random with distribution determined by
the initial wavefunction. Our model is nonlocal and violates Bell's inequality
though it does not make use of a preferred slicing of space-time or any other
sort of synchronization of spacelike separated points. Like the GRW model, it
reproduces the quantum probabilities in all cases presently testable, though it
entails deviations from the quantum formalism that are in principle testable.
Our model works in Minkowski space-time as well as in (well-behaved) curved
background space-times.

adiabatic passage between a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms and fermionic
molecules. For two-color photoassociation, the system admits stimulated Raman
adiabatic passage (STIRAP) from a Bose-Fermi mixture of atoms to stable Fermi
molecules, even in the presence of particle-particle interactions. By tailoring
the STIRAP sequence it is possible to deliberately convert only a fraction of

atom-molecule Cooper pairing via density fluctuations; unfortunately, this
enhancement is insufficient to achieve a superfluid transition with present

corresponds to the time delay of one of the polarization modes. This method is
robust against the phase instability of the interferometers despite the use of
time-bins. Moreover synchronized clocks are not required in the ideal situation
no photon loss case as they are only necessary to label the different encoded

studied. This stability is quantified by the fidelity. Dependence of fidelity
on the initial state as well as on the dynamical properties of the system is
considered. In particular, systems having a chaotic or regular classical limit
are analysed. The fidelity decay rate is given by an integral of the
correlation function of the perturbation and is thus smaller the faster
correlation function decays. If the perturbation can be written as a time
derivative of another operator, meaning that the time averaged perturbation
vanishes, fidelity freezes at a constant value and starts to decay only after a
long time inversely proportional to the perturbation strength. In composite
systems stability of entanglement to perturbations of the Hamiltonian is
analysed in terms of purity. For regular systems purity decay is shown to be
independent of Planck's constant for coherent initial states in the
semiclassical limit. The accelerated decoherence of macroscopic superpositions
is also explained. The theory of fidelity decay is applied to the stability of
quantum computation and an improved quantum Fourier transform algorithm is
designed.

find that the distribution follows a universal Poisson form independent of the

all four of his space-time coordinates. The user must carry a corner cube
reflector, a good clock, and have a two-way classical channel of communication
with the origin of the reference frame. Four pairs of entangled photons
(biphotons) are sent through four interferometers: three interferometers are
used to determine the user's spatial position, and an additional interferometer
is used to synchronize the user's clock to coordinate time in the reference
frame. The spatial positioning part of the QPS is similar to a classical
time-of-arrival (TOA) system, however, a classical TOA system (such as GPS)
must have synchronized clocks that keep coordinate time and therefore the
clocks must have long-term stability, whereas in the QPS only a photon
coincidence counter is needed and the clocks need only have short-term
stability. Several scenarios are considered for a QPS: one is a terrestrial
system and another is a space-based-system composed of low-Earth orbit (LEO)
satellites. Calculations indicate that for a space-based system, neglecting
atmospheric effects, a position accuracy below the 1 cm-level is possible for
much of the region near the Earth. The QPS may be used as a primary system to
define a global 4-dimensional reference frame.

phase-locked conditions. We show that such quantum states can be generated in
self-phase locked nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator (NOPO) based on a
type-II phase-matched down-conversion combined with linear mixer of two
orthogonally polarized modes of the subharmonics in a cavity. A quantum theory
of this device, recently realized in the experiment, is developed for both
sub-threshold and above-threshold operational regimes. We show that the system
providing high level phase coherence between two generated modes, unlike to the
ordinary NOPO, also exhibits different types of quantum correlations between
photon numbers and phases of these modes. We quantify the CV entanglement as
two-mode squeezing and show that the maximal degree of the integral two-mode
squeezing(that is 50% relative to the level of vacuum fluctuations) is achieved
at the pump field intensity close to the generation threshold of self-phase
locked NOPO, provided that the constant of linear coupling between the two
polarizations is much less than the mode detunings. The peculiarities of CV
entanglement for the case of unitary, non-dissipative dynamics of the system

follows definite trajectories, as in Bohmian Mechanics or Nelson's stochastic
mechanics; in the new theory, however, the trajectories are classical, i.e.
Newtonian. This result is obtained by developing the following concepts: (i)
the essential elements of a hidden variable theory are a set of trajectories
and a measure defined on it; the Newtonian HCT will be defined by giving these
two elements. (ii) The universal wave function has a tree structure, whose
branches are generated by the measurement processes and are spatially
disjoined. (iii) The branches have a classical structure, i.e. classical paths
go along them; this property derives from the fact that the paths close to the
classical ones give the main contribution to the Feynman propagator. (iv)
Classical trajectories can give rise to quantum phenomena, like for instance
the interference phenomena of the two-slit experiment, by violating the so
called Independence Assumption, which is always implicitely made in the
conceptual analysis of these phenomena.

Within this approximation, we present a theory for the squeezing of the atomic

Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model which describes many physical systems such as the
two-mode Bose-Einstein condensates. We consider two different initial states
which are physically relevant and show that their entanglement dynamics are

coherent radiation by nuclear spins. The theory of nuclear spin superradiance
is developed and the experimental observations of this phenomenon are
considered. The intriguing problem of how coherence develops from initially
incoherent quantum fluctuations is analysed. All main types of coherent
radiation by nuclear spins are discussed, which are: free nuclear induction,
collective induction, maser generation, pure superradiance, triggered
superradiance, pulsing superradiance, punctuated superradiance, and induced
emission. The influence of electron-nuclear hyperfine interactions and the role
of magnetic anisotropy are studied. Conditions for realizing spin superradiance
by magnetic molecules are investigated. The possibility of nuclear matter
lasing, accompanied by pion or dibaryon radiation, is briefly touched.

oscillation period, the kicking apparatus performs a nondemolition measurement.
While dephasing is unavoidable, the nondemolition measurement can (1) slow
relaxation of diagonal density matrix elements, (2) avoid detector back-action,
and (3) allow for a large signal-to-noise ratio. Deviations from the ideal
behavior are studied by allowing for detuning of the waiting time, as well as
finite-time, noisy pulses. The scheme is illustrated with a double-dot qubit

description of a decohering quantum system. Under these conditions approximate
techniques to simplify a multileveled system by its first two levels is
unreliable and a realistic multilevel description in the formulation of
decoherence is unavoidable. In this regard, our first crucial observation is
that, the validity of the two level approximation of a multileveled system is
not controlled purely by {\it sufficiently low temperatures}. We demonstrate
using three different environmental spectral models that the type of
system-environment coupling and the environmental spectrum have a dominant role
over the temperature. Particularly, zero temperature quantum fluctuations
induced by the Caldeira-Leggett type linear coordinate coupling can be
influential in a wide energy range in the systems allowed transitions. The
second crucial observation against the validity of the two level approximation
is that the decoherence times being among the system's short time scales are
found to be dominated not by the resonant but {\it non-resonant} processes. We
demonstrate this in three stages. Firstly, our zero temperature numerical
calculations reveal that, the calculated decoherence rates including
relaxation, dephasing and leakage phenomena show, a linear dependence on the
spectral area for all spectral models used, independent from the spectral shape
within a large environmental spectral range compared to the quantum system's
energies. Secondly, within the same range, the decoherence times only have a
marginal dependence on the translations of the entire frequency spectrum.
Finally, the same decoherence rates show strong dependence on the number of
coupled levels by the system-environment coupling.

show that the density matrix of a graph can be always written as a uniform
mixture of pure density matrices of graphs. We consider the von Neumann entropy

maximum values are attained. We then discuss the problem of separability by
pointing out that separability of density matrices of graphs does not always

linked to the entanglement of the state. We calculate the concurrence of all
graph on four vertices representing entangled states. It turns out that for
some of these graphs the value of the concurrence is exactly fractional.

applies to a broad class of ontological models of quantum theory, rather than
just deterministic hidden variable models. We derive three no-go theorems for
ontological models, each based on an assumption of noncontextuality for a
different sort of experimental procedure; one for preparation procedures,
another for unsharp measurement procedures (that is, measurement procedures
associated with positive-operator valued measures), and a third for
transformation procedures. All three proofs apply to two-dimensional Hilbert

because the state-space of an n-qubit register is not finite and contains
exponential superpositions of classical bit strings. Our proposed circuits are
asymptotically optimal for respective tasks and improve published results by at
least a factor of two.
  The circuits for generic quantum computation constructed by our algorithms
are the most efficient known today in terms of the number of expensive gates
(quantum controlled-NOTs). They are based on an analogue of the Shannon
decomposition of Boolean functions and a new circuit block, quantum
multiplexor, that generalizes several known constructions. A theoretical lower
bound implies that our circuits cannot be improved by more than a factor of
two. We additionally show how to accommodate the severe architectural
limitation of using only nearest-neighbor gates that is representative of

QMA-complete for any k &lt;= 3. On the other hand 1-local Hamiltonian is in P, and
hence not believed to be QMA-complete. The complexity of the 2-local
Hamiltonian problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and

rate of acquisition of the relative phase between different wp components is
enormous (for a bullet it is typically $10^{14}$ GHertz) with also a very large

topological angle that is acquired upon making a loop around a degeneracy

expressions involve the partial derivatives (with respect to the nuclear
coordinates) of the matrix elements of the coupling Hamiltonian. Examples are
given of a few studied cases, such as of excited states that have topological
angles with a sign opposite to those in the ground states. In the second part,
the two dimensional (or two parameter) situation that characterizes a conical
intersection (ci) between potential surfaces in a polyatomic molecule is
constructed as a limiting case of the three dimensional Dirac-monopole
situation. For an electron occupying a twofold state, we obtain both the
&quot;magnetic-field&quot; (or curl-field) and the tensorial (or Yang-Mills-) field
(which is the sum of a curl and of a vector- product term). These pseudo-
fields represent the reaction of the electron on the nuclear motion via the
nonadiabatic coupling terms (NACTs). We find that both fields are aligned with
the orthogonal, (so called) seam directions of the ci and are zero everywhere
outside the seam, but they differ as regards the flux that they produce. In a
two-state situation, the fields are representation dependent and the values of,
e.g., the fluxes depend on the state that the electron occupies. The angular
dependence of the NACTs and the fields calculated from a general linearly
coupled model agrees with recently computed results for $C_2 H$ [A.M. Mebel, M.
Baer and S.H. Lin, J.Chem. Phys. {\bf 115} 3673 (2001)]. An

quantum circuit consisting solely of CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates -- can be
simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem
in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we
make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor-2 increase in
the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the
improved algorithm in a freely-available program called CHP
(CNOT-Hadamard-Phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we
show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the
classical complexity class ParityL, which means that stabilizer circuits are
probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient
algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states,
putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a &quot;canonical form&quot; that requires at
most O(n^2/log n) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our
simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a
limited number of non-stabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general
tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of
measurements.

Science, 296, 2193

independent condensates with random initial phases can develop a unique
relative phase when we move them together. In the adiabatic limit, the uniting
of independent condensates can be understood from the eigenstate evolution of
the governing Hamiltonian, which maps degenerate states (corresponding to
fragmented condensates) to a single state (corresponding to a united
condensate) . In the non-adiabatic limit corresponding to the practical
experimental configurations, we give an explanation on why we can still get a
large condensate fraction with a unique relative phase. Detailed numerical
simulations are then performed for the non-adiabatic merging of the

results may have interesting implications for realizing a continuous atom laser

that in order to properly incorporate the phenomenon of self-observation, the
Heisenberg picture with time going backwards provides a consistent description.
We show that, if this claim holds true, the assumption in nonlocality proofs

very small, its magnitude can be comparable to the condensation energy of the

ideal classical clock external to the system under study. This is clearly an
idealization. As emphasized originally by Salecker and Wigner and more recently
by other authors, there exist limits in nature to how ``classical'' even the
best possible clock can be. When one introduces realistic clocks, quantum
mechanics ceases to be unitary and a fundamental mechanism of decoherence of
quantum states arises. We estimate the rate of universal loss of unitarity
using optimal realistic clocks. In particular we observe that the rate is rapid
enough to eliminate the black hole information puzzle: all information is lost
through the fundamental decoherence before the black hole can evaporate. This
improves on a previous calculation we presented with a sub-optimal clock in
which only part of the information was lost by the time of evaporation.

blue-sideband excitations. In leading order of the Lamb-Dicke expansion, this
suppresses all heating processes. As a consequence, the double-EIT scheme can

expression for the Casimir-Polder force acting on an atom prepared in an
arbitrary electronic state. For a non-driven atom in the weak coupling regime,
the force as a function of time is shown to be a superposition of force
components that are related to the electronic density matrix elements at chosen
time. These force components depend on the position-dependent polarizability of
the atom that correctly accounts for the body-induced level shifts and
broadenings.

  quantization scheme for a dispersive dielectric</title><description>  An ad hoc quantization scheme for the electromagnetic field in a weakly
dispersive, transparent dielectric leads to the definition of canonical and
kinetic forms for the momentum of the electromagnetic field in a dispersive
medium. The canonical momentum is uniquely defined as the operator that
generates spatial translations in a uniform medium, but the quantization scheme
suggests two possible choices for the kinetic momentum operator, corresponding
to the Abraham or the Minkowski momentum in classical electrodynamics. Another
implication of this procedure is that a wave packet containing a single dressed
photon travels at the group velocity through the medium. The physical
significance of the canonical momentum has already been established by
considerations of energy and momentum conservation in the atomic recoil due to
spontaneous emission, the Cerenkov effect, the Doppler effect, and phase
matching in nonlinear optical processes. In addition, the data of the Jones and
Leslie radiation pressure experiment is consistent with the assignment of one
?k unit of canonical momentum to each dressed photon. By contrast, experiments
in which the dielectric is rigidly accelerated by unbalanced electromagnetic
forces require the use of the Abraham momentum.

The electron spends no time in the middle dot and does not change its energy

this scheme may well prove useful in incoherent electronic computation (for
example quantum-dot cellular automata) where it may provide a coherent
advantage to an otherwise incoherent device. It can also be thought of as a
limiting case of type II quantum computing, where sufficient coherence exists
for a single gate operation, but not for the preservation of superpositions
after the operation. We extend our analysis to the case of many intervening

space-time symmetries and internal quantum symmetries are indistinguishable
before symmetry breaking. Based on this principle, a higher-dimensional
extension of Minkowski space is proposed and its properties examined. In this
scheme the structure of space-time is intrinsically quantum mechanical. It is
shown that the causal geometry of such a quantum space-time possesses a rich
hierarchical structure. The natural extension of the Poincare group to quantum
space-time is investigated. In particular, we prove that the symmetry group of
a quantum space-time is generated in general by a system of irreducible Killing
tensors. When the symmetries of a quantum space-time are spontaneously broken,
then the points of the quantum space-time can be interpreted as space-time
valued operators. The generic point of a quantum space-time in the broken
symmetry phase thus becomes a Minkowski space-time valued operator. Classical
space-time emerges as a map from quantum space-time to Minkowski space. It is
shown that the general such map satisfying appropriate causality-preserving
conditions ensuring linearity and Poincare invariance is necessarily a density
matrix.

important quantum information processing paradigm, in which two parties sharing
many copies of the same bipartite quantum state distill local pure states, by
means of local unitary operations assisted by a one-way (two-way) completely
dephasing channel. Local pure states are a valuable resource from a
thermodynamical point of view, since they allow thermal energy to be converted
into work by local quantum heat engines. We give a simple

purity, which turns out to be closely related to a previously known operational
measure of classical correlations, the one-way distillable common randomness.

can be read out from the time average of the Hamiltonian dynamics of a
2-dimensional crystal on a cylinder. The Hamiltonian is a spatially local
interaction among Wigner-Seitz cells containing 6 qubits. The quantum circuit
that is simulated is specified by the initialization of program qubits. As in
Margolus' Hamiltonian cellular automaton (implementing classical circuits), a
propagating wave in a clock register controls asynchronously the application of
the gates. However, in our approach all required initializations are basis
states. After a while the synchronizing wave is essentially spread around the
whole crystal. The circuit is designed such that the result is available with
probability about 1/4 despite of the completely undefined computation step.
This model reduces quantum computing to preparing basis states for some qubits,
waiting, and measuring in the computational basis. Even though it may be
unlikely to find our specific Hamiltonian in real solids, it is possible that
also more natural interactions allow ergodic quantum computing.

construct the approximate classical description of the systems for which the
classical approximation is possible. During the last time, the Wigner function
formalism is applied as well to seek indications of specific quantum properties
of quantum systems leading to impossibility of the classical approximation
construction. Most of all, as such an indication the existence of negative
values in Wigner function for specific states of the quantum system being
studied is used. The existence of such values itself prejudices the
probabilistic interpretation of the Wigner function, though for an arbitrary
observable depending jointly on the coordinate and the momentum of the quantum
system just the Wigner function gives an effective instrument to calculate the
average value and the other statistical characteristics.
  In this paper probabilistic interpretation of the Wigner function based on
coordination of theoretical-probabilistic definition of the probability
density, with restrictions to a physically small domain of phase space due to
the uncertainty principle, is proposed.

resonance quantum information processor are presented, and shown to be
consistent with a detailed model of the system-plus-apparatus used for the
experiments. The quantum operation studied was the quantum Fourier transform,
which is important in several quantum algorithms and poses a rigorous test for
the precision of our recently-developed strongly modulating control fields. The
results were analyzed in an attempt to decompose the implementation errors into
coherent (overall systematic), incoherent (microscopically deterministic), and
decoherent (microscopically random) components. This analysis yielded a
superoperator consisting of a unitary part that was strongly correlated with
the theoretically expected unitary superoperator of the quantum Fourier
transform, an overall attenuation consistent with decoherence, and a residual
portion that was not completely positive - although complete positivity is
required for any quantum operation. By comparison with the results of computer
simulations, the lack of complete positivity was shown to be largely a
consequence of the incoherent errors during the quantum process tomography
procedure. These simulations further showed that coherent, incoherent, and
decoherent errors can often be identified by their distinctive effects on the
spectrum of the overall superoperator. The gate fidelity of the experimentally
determined superoperator was 0.64, while the correlation coefficient between
experimentally determined superoperator and the simulated superoperator was
0.79; most of the discrepancies with the simulations could be explained by the
cummulative effect of small errors in the single qubit gates.

efficient way. We use this result to build powerful numerical simulation
techniques to describe the ground state, finite temperature, and evolution of
spin systems in two and higher dimensions.

correlations between local measurements carried out on these states cannot
always be reproduced by local hidden variable models. Svetlichny, followed by
others, showed that multipartite quantum states are even more nonlocal than
bipartite ones in the sense that nonlocal classical models with (super-luminal)
communication between some of the parties cannot reproduce the quantum
correlations. Here we study in detail the kinds of nonlocality present in
quantum states. More precisely we enquire what kinds of classical communication
patterns cannot reproduce quantum correlations. By studying the extremal points
of the space of all multiparty probability distributions, in which all parties
can make one of a pair of measurements each with two possible outcomes, we find
a necessary condition for classical nonlocal models to reproduce the statistics
of all quantum states. This condition extends and generalises work of
Svetlichny and others in which it was shown that a particular class of
classical nonlocal models, the ``separable'' models, cannot reproduce the
statistics of all multiparticle quantum states. Our condition shows that the
nonlocality present in some entangled multiparticle quantum states is much
stronger than previously thought. We also study the sufficiency of our
condition.

information processing is that quantum mechanics, the theory that describes
microscopic particles, allows the processing of information in fundamentally
new ways. But just as in classical information processing, errors occur in
quantum information processing, and these have to be corrected. A fundamental
breakthrough was the realisation that quantum error correction is in fact
possible. However most work so far has not been concerned with technological
feasibility, but rather with proving that quantum error correction is possible
in principle. Here we describe a method for filtering out errors and
entanglement purification which is particularly suitable for quantum
communication. Our method is conceptually new, and, crucially, it is easy to
implement in a wide variety of physical systems with present day technology and
should therefore be of wide applicability.

imperfection in achieving control over quantum systems. This problem, which has
been well studied in nuclear magnetic resonance, can be addressed by replacing
single operations with composite sequences of pulsed operations, which cause
errors to cancel by symmetry. Remarkably, this can be achieved without
knowledge of the amount of error epsilon. Independent of the initial state of
the system, current techniques allow the error to be reduced to O(epsilon^3).
Here, we extend the composite pulse technique to cancel errors to O(epsilon^n),
for arbitrary n.

  operator in an infinite dimensional quantum system</title><description>  This paper proposes an extension of Chaitin's halting probability \Omega to a
measurement operator in an infinite dimensional quantum system. Chaitin's
\Omega is defined as the probability that the universal self-delimiting Turing
machine U halts, and plays a central role in the development of algorithmic
information theory. In the theory, there are two equivalent ways to define the
program-size complexity H(s) of a given finite binary string s. In the standard
way, H(s) is defined as the length of the shortest input string for U to output
s. In the other way, the so-called universal probability m is introduced first,
and then H(s) is defined as -log_2 m(s) without reference to the concept of
program-size.
  Mathematically, the statistics of outcomes in a quantum measurement are
described by a positive operator-valued measure (POVM) in the most general
setting. Based on the theory of computability structures on a Banach space
developed by Pour-El and Richards, we extend the universal probability to an
analogue of POVM in an infinite dimensional quantum system, called a universal
semi-POVM. We also give another characterization of Chaitin's \Omega numbers by
universal probabilities. Then, based on this characterization, we propose to
define an extension of \Omega as a sum of the POVM elements of a universal
semi-POVM. The validity of this definition is discussed.
  In what follows, we introduce an operator version \hat{H}(s) of H(s) in a
Hilbert space of infinite dimension using a universal semi-POVM, and study its
properties.

reduced to 10.6% +/- 0.1%, thereby guaranteeing the cryptographic security.

It is

from Born-rule probabilities outside the event horizon. The resulting states
have non-standard or 'nonequilibrium' distributions of hidden variables, with a
specific observable signature - a breakdown of the sinusoidal modulation of
quantum probabilities for two-state systems. Outgoing Hawking radiation is
predicted to contain statistical anomalies outside the domain of the quantum
formalism. Further, it is argued that even for a macroscopic black hole, if one
half of an entangled EPR-pair should fall behind the event horizon, the other
half will develop similar statistical anomalies. We propose a simple rule,
whereby the relative entropy of the nonequilibrum (hidden-variable)
distribution generated outside the horizon balances the increase in von Neumann
entropy associated with the pure-to-mixed transition. It is argued that there
are relationships between hidden-variable and von Neumann entropies even in
non-gravitational physics. We consider the possibility of observing anomalous
polarisation probabilities, in the radiation from primordial black holes, and
in the atomic cascade emission of entangled photon pairs from black-hole

of the many-body density along the path, the presented theory is equivalent to
a stochastic theory in one-body density matrix space, in which each density
matrix evolves according to its own mean field augmented by a one-body noise.
Guided by the exact reformulation, a stochastic mean field dynamics valid in
the weak coupling approximation is proposed. This theory leads to an
approximate treatment of two-body effects similar to the extended
Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock (Extended TDHF) scheme. In this stochastic mean

class of quantum spin-chain Hamiltonians - those that are related to quadratic
forms of Fermi operators - between the first N spins and the rest of the system
in the limit of infinite total chain length. We show that the entropy can be
expressed in terms of averages over the classical compact groups and establish
an explicit correspondence between the symmetries of a given Hamiltonian and
those characterizing the Haar measure of the associated group. These averages
are either Toeplitz determinants or determinants of combinations of Toeplitz
and Hankel matrices. Recent generalizations of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture
are used to compute the leading order asymptotics of the entropy as N --&gt;
infinity . This is shown to grow logarithmically with N. The constant of
proportionality is determined explicitly, as is the next (constant) term in the
asymptotic expansion. The logarithmic growth of the entropy was previously
predicted on the basis of numerical computations and conformal-field-theoretic
calculations. In these calculations the constant of proportionality was
determined in terms of the central charge of the Virasoro algebra. Our results
therefore lead to an explicit formula for this charge. We also show that the
entropy is related to solutions of ordinary differential equations of
Painlev\'e type. In some cases these solutions can be evaluated to all orders
using recurrence relations.

quantum communications results reported in a recent paper (J. C. Bienfang et
al., quant-ph/0405097, hereafter referred to as &quot;Bienfang et al.&quot;), who
contrast the quantum communications rate of their partial QKD implementation
(which does not produce cryptographically useful shared, secret keys) over a
short transmission distance, with the secret bit rates of previous full QKD
implementations over much longer distances. We show that when a
cryptographically relevant comparison with previous results is made, the system
described by Bienfang et al. would offer no advantages for QKD, contrary to
assertions in their paper and in spite of its high clock rate. Further, we show
that the claim made by Bienfang et al. that &quot;high transmission rates serve ...

analysis illustrates an important aspect of QKD that is too often overlooked in
experiments: the sifted bit rate can be a highly misleading indicator of the
performance of a QKD system.

  principle of uncertainty</title><description>  We analyze the quantum dynamics of the non-relativistic two-dimensional
isotropic harmonic oscillator in Heisenberg's picture. Such a system is taken
as toy model to analyze some of the various quantum theories that can be built
from the application of Dirac's quantization rule to the various symplectic
structures recently reported for this classical system. It is pointed out that
that these quantum theories are inequivalent in the sense that the mean values
for the operators (observables) associated with the same physical classical
observable do not agree with each other. The inequivalence does not arise from
ambiguities in the ordering of operators but from the fact of having several
symplectic structures defined with respect to the same set of coordinates. It
is also shown that the uncertainty relations between the fundamental
observables depend on the particular quantum theory chosen. It is important to
emphasize that these (somehow paradoxical) results emerge from the combination
of two paradigms: Dirac's quantization rule and the usual Copenhagen
interpretation of quantum mechanics.

dot chain. Quantum dots are coupled through hopping and each dot can accept
zero, one or two electrons. Vacuum and double occupation states have the same
potential energy, while single occupation states are characterized by a lower
potential energy. A single dot initially decoupled from the others is weakly
coupled with an external element (Bob), where a pair of electrons has been
previously localized. Because of hopping after a suitable time the two dots
charge states become maximally entangled. Another chain dot (Alice) is put in
an unknown superposition of vacuum and double occupation states, and the other
dots are initially empty. The time evolution of the system involves an electron
diffusive process. A post selection procedure represented by the detection of
charge pairs in a region of the chain equidistant from Alice and Bob, allows,
if successful, the reconstruction on the Bob site of the unknown state
initially encoded by Alice. The peculiar feature of the model is that the
introduction of a trapped magnetic field strongly improves the process
efficiency.

high-dimensional bipartite systems. These correlations are quantified by
parameters that are subject to the &quot;concentration of measure&quot; phenomenon,
meaning that on a large-probability set these parameters are close to their
expectation. For the entropy of entanglement, this has the counterintuitive
consequence that there exist large subspaces in which all pure states are close
to maximally entangled. This, in turn, implies the existence of mixed states
with entanglement of formation near that of a maximally entangled state, but
with negligible quantum mutual information and, therefore, negligible
distillable entanglement, secret key, and common randomness. It also implies a
very strong locking effect for the entanglement of formation: its value can
jump from maximal to near zero by tracing over a number of qubits negligible
compared to the size of total system. Furthermore, such properties are generic.
Similar phenomena are observed for random multiparty states, leading us to
speculate on the possibility that the theory of entanglement is much simplified
when restricted to asymptotically generic states. Further consequences of our
results include a complete derandomization of the protocol for universal
superdense coding of quantum states.

goal is to find an implementation of a given group-covariant POVM by a quantum

group we develop a general approach for the implementation of group-covariant
POVMs which consist of rank-one operators. The construction relies on a method
to decompose matrices that intertwine two representations of a finite group. We
give several examples for which the resulting quantum circuits are efficient.
In particular, we obtain efficient quantum circuits for a class of POVMs
generated by Weyl-Heisenberg groups. These circuits allow to implement an
approximative simultaneous measurement of the position and crystal momentum of
a particle moving on a cyclic chain.

communication. In the case of preparing unentangled states, an earlier paper
showed that a 2n-qubit quantum state could be communicated to a receiver by
physically transmitting only n+o(n) qubits in addition to consuming n ebits of
entanglement and some shared randomness. When the states to be prepared are
entangled, we find that there is a reduction in the number of qubits that need
to be transmitted, interpolating between no communication at all for maximally
entangled states and the earlier two-for-one result of the unentangled case,
all without the use of any shared randomness. We also present two applications
of our result: a direct proof of the achievability of the optimal superdense
coding protocol for entangled states produced by a memoryless source, and a
demonstration that the quantum identification capacity of an ebit is two

  of One-way Quantum Transmission</title><description>  We consider the scenario where Alice wants to send a secret (classical)
$n$-bit message to Bob using a classical key, and where only one-way
transmission from Alice to Bob is possible. In this case, quantum communication
cannot help to obtain perfect secrecy with key length smaller then $n$. We
study the question of whether there might still be fundamental differences
between the case where quantum as opposed to classical communication is used.
In this direction, we show that there exist ciphers with perfect security
producing quantum ciphertext where, even if an adversary knows the plaintext
and applies an optimal measurement on the ciphertext, his Shannon uncertainty
about the key used is almost maximal. This is in contrast to the classical case
where the adversary always learns $n$ bits of information on the key in a known
plaintext attack. We also show that there is a limit to how different the
classical and quantum cases can be: the most probable key, given matching
plain- and ciphertexts, has the same probability in both the quantum and the
classical cases. We suggest an application of our results in the case where
only a short secret key is available and the message is much longer.

one-dimensional QM is given. Possible extensions of SUSY in one dimension are
described. They include (no more than) ${\cal N} =2$ extended SUSY with two
nilpotent SUSY charges which generate the hidden symmetry acting as a central
charge. Embedding stationary quantum systems into a non-stationary SUSY QM is
shown to yield new insight on quantum orbits and on spectrum generating

atoms close to a dielectric-vacuum interface. This is the first observation of
modified radiative properties in vacuum near a dielectric surface. A cloud of
cold atoms was created using a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and optical molasses
cooling. Evanescent waves (EW) were used to observe the behavior of the atoms
near the surface. We observed an increase of the absorption linewidth with up
to 25% with respect to the free-space value. Approximately half the broadening
can be explained by cavity-quantum electrodynamics (CQED) as an increase of the
natural linewidth and inhomogeneous broadening. The remainder we attribute to
local Stark shifts near the surface. By varying the characteristic EW length we
have observed a distance dependence characteristic for CQED.

Nevertheless, their form is similar to that of completely positive maps. Only

  We prove a novel result that for complex scalar matter sector, the bound

linear-chain configuration of identical two-level atoms containing the energy
of a single quasi-resonant photon in the form of a collective excitation, where
the collective behaviour is mediated by exchange of transverse photons between
the atoms. For a circular configuration of atoms the effective Hamiltonian on
the radiationless subspace of the system can be diagonalized analytically. In
this case, the radiationless energy eigenstates carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ quantum
number $p=0,1, ..., N$ which is analogous to the angular momentum quantum
number $l= 0, 1, ...$, carried by particles propagating in a central potential,
such as a hydrogen-like system. Just as the hydrogen s-states are the only
electronic wave functions which can occupy the central region of the Coulomb
potential, the quasi-particle corresponding to a collective excitation of the
circular atomic sample can occupy the central atom only for vanishing
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ quantum number $p$. For large numbers of atoms in a maximally
subradiant state, a critical interatomic distance of $\lambda/2$ emerges both
in the linear-chain and the circular configuration of atoms. The spontaneous
decay rate of the linear configuration exhibits a jump-like &quot;critical&quot;
behaviour for next-neighbour distances close to a half-wavelength. Furthermore,
both the linear-chain and the circular configuration exhibit exponential photon
trapping once the next-neighbour distance becomes less than a half-wavelength,
with the suppression of spontaneous decay being particularly pronounced in the
circular system. In this way, circular configurations containing sufficiently
many atoms may be natural candidates for {\it single-photon traps}.

groups forms the basis of a &quot;quantum attack&quot; of elliptic curve cryptosystems.
To implement this algorithm on a quantum computer requires the efficient
implementation of the elliptic curve group operation. Such an implementation
requires we be able to compute inverses in the underlying field. In [PZ03],
Proos and Zalka show how to implement the extended Euclidean algorithm to
compute inverses in the prime field GF(p). They employ a number of
optimizations to achieve a running time of O(n^2), and a space-requirement of
O(n) qubits (there are some trade-offs that they make, sacrificing a few extra
qubits to reduce running-time). In practice, elliptic curve cryptosystems often
use curves over the binary field GF(2^m). In this paper, we show how to
implement the extended Euclidean algorithm for polynomials to compute inverses
in GF(2^m). Working under the assumption that qubits will be an `expensive'
resource in realistic implementations, we optimize specifically to reduce the
qubit space requirement, while keeping the running-time polynomial. Our
implementation here differs from that in [PZ03] for GF(p), and we are able to
take advantage of some properties of the binary field GF(2^m). We also optimize
the overall qubit space requirement for computing the group operation for
elliptic curves over GF(2^m) by decomposing the group operation to make it
&quot;piecewise reversible&quot; (similar to what is done in [PZ03] for curves over
GF(p)).

composing matter do not obey Newton's laws. Instead, their behavior is
described by the Schroedinger equation. Surprisingly though, until recently, no
clear explanation was given for why everyday objects, which are merely
collections of atoms, are observed to obey Newton's laws. It would seem that,
if quantum mechanics explains all the properties of atoms accurately, they,
too, should obey quantum mechanics. This reasoning led some scientists to
believe in a distinct macroscopic, or ``big and complicated,'' world in which
quantum mechanics fails and classical mechanics takes over, although there has
never been experimental evidence for such a failure. Even those who insisted
that Newtonian mechanics would somehow emerge from the underlying quantum
mechanics as the system became increasingly macroscopic were hindered by the
lack of adequate experimental and theoretical tools. In the last decade,
however, this quantum-to-classical transition has become accessible to
experimental study and quantitative description, and the resulting insights are
the subject of this article.

descriptions that are valid for more strongly coupled qubit-resonator systems.
Here we present a simple theoretical technique, using a basis of dressed
states, to perturbatively account for the leading-order corrections to the RWA.
By comparison with exact numerical results, we demonstrate that the method is
accurate for moderately strong coupling, and provides a useful theoretical tool
for describing fast quantum information processing. The method applies to any
quantum two-level system linearly coupled to a harmonic oscillator or
single-mode boson field.

  subwavelength-diameter optical fiber</title><description>  We suggest using a two-color evanescent light field around a
subwavelength-diameter fiber to trap and guide atoms. The optical fiber carries
a red-detuned light and a blue-detuned light, with both modes far from
resonance. When both input light fields are circularly polarized, a set of
trapping minima of the total potential in the transverse plane is formed as a
ring around the fiber. This design allows confinement of atoms to a cylindrical
shell around the fiber. When one or both of the input light fields are linearly
polarized, the total potential has two local minimum points in the transverse
plane. This design allows confinement of atoms to two straight lines parallel
to the fiber axis. Due to the thin thickness of the fiber, we can use
far-off-resonance fields with substantially differing evanescent decay lengths
to produce a net potential with a large depth, a large coherence time, and a
large trap lifetime. For example, a 0.2-$\mu$m-radius silica fiber carrying 30
mW of 1.06-$\mu$m-wavelength light and 29 mW of 700-nm-wavelength light, both
fields are circularly polarized at the input, gives for cesium atoms a trap
depth of 2.9 mK, a coherence time of 32 ms, and a recoil-heating-limited trap
lifetime of 541 s.

  Computers</title><description>  In this paper, we present an ensemble algorithm for selection problem to find
the k-th smallest element in the unsorted database. We will search the k-th
smallest element by using &quot;divide-and-conquer&quot; strategy. We first divide D, the
domain of the database, into two parts, determine which of the two parts the
object element sought belongs to, and then concentrate on that part. We repeat
divide that part until object element is found. The determination of which part
depends on the output of ensemble counting scheme, which outputs the number of
assignments satisfying the value of the oracle query function is set to one.
Our algorithm modifies the ensemble counting scheme by constructing a new
oracle query function g_y(j). We set g_y(j) to one if the j-th element is less
than or equal to y. At first, we set y to the middle value of D and perform the
ensemble counting scheme with the oracle query function g_y(.) to compute the
number C, the number of j satisfying g_y(j)=1. If C&gt;k, the object element lies
in the first half of D. If C&lt;=k, then it must be in the second half of D. We
recursively apply this method by adapting y until the object element is found.
Our algorithm thus requires O(ln|D|) oracle queries for adequate measure
accuracy to find the k-th smallest element, where |D| denotes the size of D.

include effective three-spin interactions. Such interactions can be employed to
simulate specific one or two dimensional physical systems that are of
particular interest for their condensed matter and entanglement properties. In
particular, connections between the scaling behaviour of entanglement and the
entanglement properties of closely spaced spins are drawn. Moreover, three-spin
interactions are well suited to support quantum computing without the need to
manipulate individual qubits. By employing Raman transitions or the interaction
of the atomic electric dipole moment with magnetic field gradients, one can
generate Hamiltonians that can be used for the physical implementation of
geometrical or topological objects. This work serves as a review article that

The classical limit of the perturbative quantum expressions, understood as the

algorithm construct the new oracle query function g(.) satisfying g(x)=0 for
all input x, except for one, say x=z, where g(z)=z. To store z, our algorithm
extends from one ancillary qubit to n ancillary qubits. We then measure these
ancillary qubits to discover z. We further use our ensemble search algorithm to
attack classical public key cryptosystems. Given the ciphertext C=Ek(m, r)
which is generated by the encryption function Ek(), a public key k, a message
m, and a random number r, we can construct an oracle query function h(.)
satisfying h(m', r')=0 if Ek(m', r')!=C and h(m', r')= (m', r') if Ek(m',
r')=C. There is only one object, say (m, r), can be discovered in decryption of

our ensemble search algorithm to find the wanted object (m, r). Obviously, we
break the classical public key cryptosystems under the ciphertext attack by

the fact that a transmission of unity leads to a coincidence of all still
competing tunneling time definitions. Thus, having an indisputable resonant
tunneling time $\tau_{res},$ we apply the natural definition
$v_{res}=L/\tau_{res}$ to calculate the velocity. For the second method we
combine Bloch's theorem with the transfer matrix approach to decompose the wave
function into two Bloch waves. Then the expectation value of the velocity is
calculated. Both different approaches lead to the same result, showing their
physical equivalence. The obtained resonant tunneling velocity $v_{res}$ is
smaller or equal to the group velocity times the magnitude of the complex
transmission amplitude of the unit cell. Only at energies where the unit cell
of the periodic structure has a transmission of unity $v_{res}$ equals the
group velocity. Numerical calculations for a GaAs/AlGaAs superlattice are

we can store using some log_2(l) qubits. The problem then is how to carry out
spatial rotations of the system in this representation. In other words we are
looking at a unitary representation of SU(2) with dimension 2l+1 and want to
implement these transformations with resources polynomial in log(l). We only
give a sketch of our solution which involves ``storing'' discretised spherical
harmonic functions Y_{l,m}(Theta,phi) in a quantum register. Also there are
some technical gaps in the construction, but they are based on plausible
assumptions. Our approach is rather cumbersome and we hope somebody will find a
nicer solution. For a nice, elementary explanation of what we are trying to do
(not involving physics or representation theory) see section 4.6.2.

field in terms of a nonlinear Riccati-type differential equation and solve the
equation analytically in time intervals much shorter than half the optical
period. The analytical solutions for subsequent intervals are then stuck
together in an iterative procedure to cover the scale time of the laser pulse.
This approach is applicable to pulses of arbitrary (nonrelativistic) strengths,
shapes and durations, thus covering the whole region of light-matter couplings
from weak through moderate to strong ones. The method allows quick insight into
different problems from the field of light--matter interaction. Very good
quality of the method is shown by recovering with it a number of subtle effects
met in earlier numerically calculated photon-emission spectra from model
molecular ions, double quantum wells, atoms and semiconductors. The method
presented is an efficient mathematical tool to describe novel effects in the
region of, e.g., extreme nonlinear optics, i.e., when two--level systems are
exposed to pulses of only a few cycles in duration and strength ensuring the
Rabi frequency to approach and even exceed the laser light frequence.

  model</title><description>  This paper concerns the so-called cosmological constant problem. In order to
solve it, we propose a toy model providing an extension of the dimensionality
of spacetime, with an additional spatial dimension which is macroscopically
unobservable. The toy model introduces no corrections to most predictions of
the &quot;standard&quot; general relativity regarding, among others, the so-called &quot;five
tests of general relativity&quot;. However, it seems that the toy model could
provide an explanation to the flatness of circular velocity curves of spiral
galaxies without introducing any dark matter. The proposed model has quite
important cosmological consequences. By introducing certain corrections to
Friedmann's currently accepted model(s), the toy model allows one to solve
problems related to the present density of matter in the Universe and, finally,
it does not contain the initial singularity.

concept of Bose-Einstein condensation to gravitational systems, a cold, dark,
compact object with an interior de Sitter condensate $p_{_V} = -\rho_{_V}$ and
an exterior Schwarzschild geometry of arbitrary total mass $M$ is constructed.
These are separated by a shell with a small but finite proper thickness $\ell$
of fluid with equation of state $p=+\rho$, replacing both the Schwarzschild and
de Sitter classical horizons. The new solution has no singularities, no event
horizons, and a global time. Its entropy is maximized under small fluctuations
and is given by the standard hydrodynamic entropy of the thin shell, which is
of order $k_{_B}\ell Mc/\hbar$, instead of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
formula, $S_{_{BH}}= 4\pi k_{_B} G M^2/\hbar c$. Hence unlike black holes, the
new solution is thermodynamically stable and has no information paradox.

  entanglement theory</title><description>  We investigate several problems in entanglement theory from the perspective
of convex optimization. This list of problems comprises (A) the decision
whether a state is multi-party entangled, (B) the minimization of expectation
values of entanglement witnesses with respect to pure product states, (C) the
closely related evaluation of the geometric measure of entanglement to quantify
pure multi-party entanglement, (D) the test whether states are multi-party
entangled on the basis of witnesses based on second moments and on the basis of
linear entropic criteria, and (E) the evaluation of instances of maximal output
purities of quantum channels. We show that these problems can be formulated as
certain optimization problems: as polynomially constrained problems employing
polynomials of degree three or less. We then apply very recently established
known methods from the theory of semi-definite relaxations to the formulated
optimization problems. By this construction we arrive at a hierarchy of
efficiently solvable approximations to the solution, approximating the exact
solution as closely as desired, in a way that is asymptotically complete. For
example, this results in a hierarchy of novel, efficiently decidable sufficient
criteria for multi-particle entanglement, such that every entangled state will
necessarily be detected in some step of the hierarchy. Finally, we present
numerical examples to demonstrate the practical accessibility of this approach.

  continuous and/or discrete energy spectrum</title><description>  Every completely positive map G that commutes which the Hamiltonian time
evolution is an integral or sum over (densely defined) CP-maps G_\sigma where
\sigma is the energy that is transferred to or taken from the environment. If
the spectrum is non-degenerated each G_\sigma is a dephasing channel followed
by an energy shift. The dephasing is given by the Hadamard product of the
density operator with a (formally defined) positive operator. The Kraus
operator of the energy shift is a partial isometry which defines a translation
on R with respect to a non-translation-invariant measure.
  As an example, I calculate this decomposition explicitly for the rotation
invariant gaussian channel on a single mode.
  I address the question under what conditions a covariant channel destroys
superpositions between mutually orthogonal states on the same orbit. For
channels which allow mutually orthogonal output states on the same orbit, a
lower bound on the quantum capacity is derived using the Fourier transform of
the CP-map-valued measure (G_\sigma).

differences between standard probability theory and its quantum counterpart. In
the course of previous investigations ultimate bounds on quantum mechanical
violations have been found. For example, Tsirelson's bound constitutes a global
upper limit for quantum violations of the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and
the Clauser-Horne (CH) inequalities. Here we investigate a method for
calculating the precise quantum bounds on arbitrary Bell-type inequalities by
solving the eigenvalue problem for the operator associated with each Bell-type
inequality. Thereby, we use the min-max principle to calculate the norm of
these self-adjoint operators from the maximal eigenvalue yielding the upper
bound for a particular set of measurement parameters. The eigenvectors
corresponding to the maximal eigenvalues provide the quantum state for which a
Bell-type inequality is maximally violated.

  Application to dispersive optical bistability</title><description>  It is well known that the squeezing spectrum of the field exiting a nonlinear
cavity can be directly obtained from the fluctuation spectrum of normally
ordered products of creation and annihilation operators of the cavity mode. In
this article we show that the output field squeezing spectrum can be derived
also by combining the fluctuation spectra of any pair of s-ordered products of
creation and annihilation operators. The interesting result is that the
spectrum obtained in this way from the linearized Langevin equations is exact,
and this occurs in spite of the fact that no s-ordered quasiprobability
distribution verifies a true Fokker-Planck equation, i.e., the Langevin
equations used for deriving the squeezing spectrum are not exact. The
(linearized) intracavity squeezing obtained from any s-ordered distribution is
also exact. These results are exemplified in the problem of dispersive optical
bistability.

of any input state. In quantum information theory, the no cloning theorem
prohibits exact copying of nonorthogonal states. Moreover, if we wish to copy
multiparticle entangled states and can perform only local operations and
classical communication (LOCC), then further restrictions apply. We investigate
the problem of copying orthogonal, entangled quantum states with an entangled
blank state under the restriction to LOCC. Throughout, the subsystems have
finite dimension D. We show that if all of the states to be copied are
non-maximally entangled, then novel LOCC copying procedures based on
entanglement catalysis are possible. We then study in detail the LOCC copying
problem where both the blank state and at least one of the states to be copied
are maximally entangled. For this to be possible, we find that all the states
to be copied must be maximally entangled. We obtain a necessary and sufficient
condition for LOCC copying under these conditions. For two orthogonal,
maximally entangled states, we provide the general solution to this condition.
We use it to show that for D=2,3, any pair of orthogonal, maximally entangled
states can be locally copied using a maximally entangled blank state. However,

photons is a multimode Optical Parametric Amplifier(OPA) whose weak limit is
the two-photon Spontaneous Parametric Downconversion(SPDC) beam. The visibility
of the double-slit pattern is calculated, taking the finite coincidence time
window of the photon counting detectors into account. It is found that the
coincidence window and the bandwidth of light reaching the detectors play a

the 'Ghost' interference experiment but in all experiments involving
coincidence detection. The differences between the loss of visibility with
two-mode and multimode OPA sources is also discussed.

of the following problem: given two physical processes described by sequences

therefore PSPACE-hard. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that the analogous

molecular wave function becomes comparable with the mean distance between the

the internal Turing machines. The internal Turing machines have the capability
to work with infinite ($*$-finite) number of bits while keeping the finite
combinatoric structures of the classical Turing machines. We will show the
following. The internal deterministic Turing machines can do in $*$-polynomial
time what a classical deterministic Turing machine can do in an arbitrary
finite amount of time. Given an element of $&lt;M;x&gt;\in HALT$ (more precisely, the
$*$-embedding of $HALT$), there is an internal deterministic Turing machine
which will take $&lt;M;x&gt;$ as input and halt in the $&quot;yes&quot;$ state. The language
${}^*Halt$ can not be decided by the internal deterministic Turing machines.
The internal deterministic Turing machines can be viewed as the asymptotic
behavior of finite precision approximation to real number computations. It is
possible to use the internal probabilistic Turing machines to simulate finite
state quantum mechanics with infinite precision. This simulation suggests that
no information can be transmitted instantaneously and at the same time, the
Turing machine model can simulate instantaneous collapse of the wave function.
The internal deterministic Turing machines are powerful, but if $P \neq NP$,
then there are internal problems which the internal deterministic Turing
machines can solve but not in $*$-polynomial time.

tunneling is computed. We consider an open quantum system with one degree of
freedom consisting of a particle trapped in a cubic potential interacting with
an environment characterized by a dissipative and a diffusion parameter. A
representation based on the energy eigenfunctions of the isolated system, i. e.
the system uncoupled to the environment, is used to write the dynamical master
equation for the reduced Wigner function of the open quantum system. This
equation becomes very simple in that representation. The use of the WKB
approximation for the eigenfunctions suggests an approximation which allows an
analytic computation of the tunneling rate, in this real time formalism, when
the system is initially trapped in the false ground state. We find that the
decoherence produced by the environment suppresses tunneling in agreement with
results in other macroscopic quantum systems with different potentials. We
confront our analytical predictions with an experiment where the escape rate
from the zero voltage state was measured for a current-biased Josephson
junction shunted with a resistor.

connections. To have a reasonable count rate after all the losses in the
propagation and the filters needed to improve the coherence, it is convenient
to increase the intensity of the laser that pumps the non-linear crystal. By
doing so, however, the importance of the four-photon component of the
down-converted field increases, thus degrading the quality of two-photon
interferences. In this paper, we present an easy derivation of this nuisance
valid for any form of entanglement generated by down-conversion, followed by a
full study of the problem for time-bin entanglement. We find that the
visibility of two-photon interferences decreases as V=1-2\rho, where \rho is,
in usual situations, the probability per pulse of creating a detectable photon
pair. In particular, the decrease of V is independent of the coherence of the
four-photon term. Thanks to the fact that \rho can be measured independently of
V, the experimental verification of our prediction is provided for two

association of the quantum state vector with each individual physical system in
an attributive way is a source of many false paradoxes and inconsistencies. The
paradoxes are avoided if the purely statistical interpretation (SI) of the
quantum state vector is adopted. According the SI the quantum theory (QT) does
not provide any deterministic prediction for any individual experimental result
obtained for a free physical system, for a trapped ion or for a quantum dot. In
this article it is shown that if the SI is used then, contrary to the general
belief, the QT does not predict for the ideal spin singlet state perfect
anti-correlation of the coincidence coumts for the distant detectors.
Subsequently the various proofs of the Bell's theorem are reanalyzed and in
particular the importance and the implications of the use of the unique
probability space in these proofs are elucidated. The use of the unique
probability space is shown to be equivalent to the use of the joint probability
distributions for the non commuting observables. The experimental violation of
the Bell's inequalities proves that the naive realistic particle like spatio-
temporal description of the various quantum mechanical experiments is
impossible. Of course it does not give any argument for the action at the
distance and it does not provide the proof of the completeness of the QM. The
fact that the quantum state vector is not an attribute of a single quantum

in the topology of a symmetric tetrahedron, uniformly frustrated with one-half
flux-quantum per loop and one-half Cooper-pair per island. This structure
emulates a noise-resistant spin-1/2 system in a vanishing magnetic field.
  The tetrahedral quantum bit combines a number of advances such as a doubly
degeneracy ground state minimizing decoherence via phonon radiation, a weak
quadratic sensitivity to electric and magnetic noise, relieved constraints on
the junction fabrication, a large freedom in manipulation, and attractive
measurement schemes.
  The simultaneous appearance of a degenerate ground state and a weak noise
sensitivity are consequences of the tetrahedral symmetry, while enhanced
quantum fluctuations derive from the special magnetic frustration. We determine
the spectral properties of the tetrahedral structure within a semiclassical
analysis and confirm the results numerically. We show how proper tuning of the
charge-frustration selects a doubly degenerate ground state and discuss the
qubit's manipulation through capacitive and inductive coupling to external bias
sources.
  The complete readout of all the spin-components is achieved through coupling
of the internal qubit currents to external junctions driven close to
criticality during the measurement.

  information bus</title><description>  We propose an effective scheme for manipulating quantum information stored in
a superconducting nanocircuit. The Josephson qubits are coupled via their
separate interactions with an information bus, a large current-biased Josephson
junction treated as an oscillator with adjustable frequency. The bus is
sequentially coupled to only one qubit at a time. Distant Josephson qubits
without any direct interaction can be indirectly coupled with each other by
independently interacting with the bus sequentially, via exciting/de-exciting
vibrational quanta in the bus. This is a superconducting analog of the
successful ion trap experiments on quantum computing. Our approach differs from
previous schemes that simultaneously coupled two qubits to the bus, as opposed
to their sequential coupling considered here. The significant quantum logic
gates can be realized by using these tunable and selective couplings. The
decoherence properties of the proposed quantum system are analyzed within the
Bloch-Redfield formalism. Numerical estimations of certain important
experimental parameters are provided.

  Mechanics: A Critical Investigation</title><description>  In Brukner and Zeilinger's interpretation of quantum mechanics, information
is introduced as the most fundamental notion and the finiteness of information
is considered as an essential feature of quantum systems. They also define a
new measure of information which is inherently different from the Shannon
information and try to show that the latter is not useful in defining the
information content in a quantum object.
  Here, we show that there are serious problems in their approach which make
their efforts unsatisfactory. The finiteness of information does not explain
how objective results appear in experiments and what an instantaneous change in
the so-called information vector (or catalog of knowledge) really means during
the measurement. On the other hand, Brukner and Zeilinger's definition of a new
measure of information may lose its significance, when the spin measurement of
an elementary system is treated realistically. Hence, the sum of the individual
measures of information may not be a conserved value in real experiments.

theorem is that any pair of authorized sets in an access structure should
overlap. From the viewpoint of application, this places an unnatural constraint
on secret sharing. We present a generalization, called assisted QSS (AQSS),
where access structures without pairwise overlap of authorized sets is
permissible, provided some shares are withheld by the share dealer. We show
that no more than $\lambda-1$ withheld shares are required, where $\lambda$ is
the minimum number of {\em partially linked classes} among the authorized sets
for the QSS. This is useful in QSS schemes where the share dealer is honest by
definition and is equivalent to a secret reconstructor. Our result means that
such applications of QSS need not be thwarted by the no-cloning theorem.

quantum mechanics to reduce the amount of communication that would be

  Pseudo-telepathy is a surprising application of quantum information
processing to communication complexity. Thanks to entanglement, perhaps the

describes how to exactly simulate an arbitrary unitary on multiple qudits using
a 2d-1 parameter family of single qudit and two qudit gates. Their technique is
based on the spectral decomposition of unitaries. Here we generalize this
argument to show that exact universality follows given a discrete set of single
qudit Hamiltonians and one two-qudit Hamiltonian. The technique is related to
the QR-matrix decomposition of numerical linear algebra. We consider a generic
physical system in which the single qudit Hamiltonians are a small collection
of H_{jk}^x=\hbar\Omega (|k&gt;&lt;j|+|j&gt;&lt;k|) and H_{jk}^y =\hbar\Omega
(i|k&gt;&lt;j|-i|j&gt;&lt;k|). A coupling graph results taking nodes 0,... d-1 and edges
j&lt;-&gt;k iff H_{jk}^{x,y} are allowed Hamiltonians. One qudit exact universality
follows iff this graph is connected, and complete universality results if the
two-qudit Hamiltonian H=-\hbar\Omega |d-1,d-1&gt;&lt;d-1,d-1| is also allowed. We
discuss implementation in the eight dimensional ground electronic states of

near the surface of a substrate. The bound and evanescent fields of optical
whispering gallery modes are calculated and the coupling to straight waveguides
is investigated using finite-difference time domain solutions of Maxwell's
equations. Results are compared with semi-analytical solutions based on coupled
mode theory. We discuss atom detection efficiencies and the feasibility of
non-destructive measurements in such a system depending on key parameters such
as disk size, disk-waveguide coupling, and scattering losses.

magnetic field perturbations: 1) an inhomogeneous magnetic field over all
space, and 2) external fields over a half space containing only one of the
particles. The field is chosen to point from one particle to the other, which
results in essentially a one-dimensional problem. A number of interesting
features are revealed for the first case: the singlet, which has zero potential
energy in the unperturbed case, remains unstable in the perturbing field. The
spin zero component of the triplet evolves into a bound state with a double
well potential, with the possibility of tunneling. Superposition states can be
constructed which oscillate between entangled and unentangled states. For the
second case, we show that changes in the magnetic field around one particle
affect measurements of the spin of the entangled particle not in the magnetic

the dipole-dipole potential energy does not vanish and is comparable to the
potential energy of the particle in the external field.

for longer evolution times a decrease in the mixedness to the same, for all the

states are rays in the standard Hilbert space of the theory, one is naturally
lead to a geometric formulation of the theory. Within this formulation of
quantum mechanics, the resulting description is very elegant from the
geometrical viewpoint, since it allows to cast the main postulates of the
theory in terms of two geometric structures, namely a symplectic structure and
a Riemannian metric. However, the usual superposition principle of quantum
mechanics is not naturally incorporated, since the quantum state space is
non-linear. In this note we offer some steps to incorporate the superposition
principle within the geometric description. In this respect, we argue that it
is necessary to make the distinction between a 'projective superposition
principle' and a 'decomposition principle' that extend the standard
superposition principle. We illustrate our proposal with two very well known
examples, namely the spin 1/2 system and the two slit experiment, where the
distinction is clear from the physical perspective. We show that the two
principles have also a different mathematical origin within the geometrical
formulation of the theory.

coherent errors originating from static residual inter-qubit couplings in a
quantum computer. It is based on a randomization of static imperfections in a
many-qubit system by the repeated application of Pauli operators which change
the computational basis. This Pauli-Random-Error-Correction (PAREC)-method
eliminates coherent errors produced by static imperfections and increases
significantly the maximum time over which realistic quantum computations can be
performed reliably. Furthermore, it does not require redundancy so that all
physical qubits involved can be used for logical purposes.

quantum gates on the stability of various quantum algorithms including the
Grover quantum search algorithm and the quantum chaos maps. For the Grover
algorithm our numerical and analytical results show existence of regular and
chaotic phases depending on the static imperfection strength $\epsilon$. The
critical border $\epsilon_c$ between two phases drops polynomially with the
number of qubits $n_q$ as $\epsilon_c \sim n_q^{-3/2}$. In the regular phase
$(\epsilon &lt; \epsilon_c)$ the algorithm remains robust against imperfections
showing the efficiency gain $\epsilon_c / \epsilon$ for $\epsilon &gt;
2^{-n_q/2}$. In the chaotic phase $(\epsilon &gt; \epsilon_c)$ the algorithm is
completely destroyed. The results for the Grover algorithm are compared with
the imperfection effects for quantum algorithms of quantum chaos maps where the
universal law for the fidelity decay is given by the Random Matrix Theory
(RMT). We also discuss a new gyroscopic quantum error correction method which
allows to reduce the effect of static imperfections. In spite of this decay
GYQEC allows to obtain a significant gain in the accuracy of quantum

nonexistence of an optimal ensemble in this case it is possible to define the
notion of the output optimal average state for such a channel. The
characterization of the output optimal average state and a &quot;minimax&quot; expression
for the Holevo capacity are obtained. This makes it possible to prove
equivalence of several additivity properties for infinite dimensional quantum
channels.
  The notion of the $\chi$-function for an infinite dimensional channel is
considered, its strong concavity and lower semicontinuity are shown.
  The problem of continuity of the Holevo capacity is also discussed. It is
shown that the Holevo capacity is continuous function of a channel in the
finite dimensional case while in general it is only lower semicontinuous. This
conclusion is confirmed by the example.
  The main result of this note is the statement that additivity of the Holevo
capacity for all finite dimensional channels implies additivity of the Holevo
capacity for all infinite dimensional channels with arbitrary constraints. The
subadditivity of the $\chi$-function for two infinite dimensional channels with
one of them noiseless or entanglement breaking is also proved.

quantum}) with respect to measurements of a set of canonical observables iff
there exists (does not exist) a well defined, positive phase space
distribution, the so called Galuber-Sudarshan $P$-representation. We derive a
family of classicality criteria that require that averages of positive
functions calculated using $P$-representation must be positive. For polynomial
functions, these criteria are related to 17-th Hilbert's problem, and have
physical meaning of generalized squeezing conditions; alternatively, they may
be interpreted as {\it non-classicality witnesses}. We show that every generic
non-classical state can be detected by a polynomial that is a sum of squares of
other polynomials (sos). We introduce a very natural hierarchy of states
regarding their degree of quantumness, which we relate to the minimal degree of
a sos polynomial that detects them is introduced. Polynomial non-classicality
witnesses can be directly measured.

prepared in a mixed state and on which measurements with imperfect detectors
are made. The weak value of an observable can be expressed as a conditional
expectation value over an infinite class of different generalized Kirkwood
quasi-probability distributions. &quot;Strange&quot; weak values for which the real part
exceeds the eigenvalue spectrum of the observable can only be found if the
Terletsky-Margenau-Hill distribution is negative, or, equivalently, if the real
part of the weak value of the density operator is negative. We find that a
classical model of a weak measurement exists whenever the
Terletsky-Margenau-Hill representation of the observable equals the classical
representation of the observable and the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill distribution
is nonnegative. Strange weak values alone are not sufficient to obtain a
contradiction with classical models.
  We propose feasible weak measurements of photon number of the radiation
field. Negative weak values of energy contradicts all classical stochastic
models, whereas negative weak values of photon number contradict all classical
stochastic models where the energy is bounded from below by the zero-point
energy. We examine coherent states in particular, and find negative weak values
with probabilities of 16% for kinetic energy (or squared field quadrature), 8%
for harmonic oscillator energy and 50% for photon number. These experiments are
robust against detector inefficiency and thermal noise.

  Matrices</title><description>  This paper initiates the study of hidden variables from the discrete,
abstract perspective of quantum computing. For us, a hidden-variable theory is
simply a way to convert a unitary matrix that maps one quantum state to
another, into a stochastic matrix that maps the initial probability
distribution to the final one in some fixed basis. We list seven axioms that we
might want such a theory to satisfy, and then investigate which of the axioms
can be satisfied simultaneously. Toward this end, we construct a new
hidden-variable theory that is both robust to small perturbations and
indifferent to the identity operation, by exploiting an unexpected connection
between unitary matrices and network flows. We also analyze previous
hidden-variable theories of Dieks and Schrodinger in terms of our axioms. In a
companion paper, we will show that actually sampling the history of a hidden
variable under reasonable axioms is at least as hard as solving the Graph
Isomorphism problem; and indeed is probably intractable even for quantum
computers.

and systems calls for an improved understanding of thermal properties on small
length scales. In this context, the question whether thermodynamics and, in
particular, the concept of temperature can apply on the nanoscale is of central
interest. Here we consider a quantum system consisting of a regular chain of
elementary subsystems with nearest neighbour interactions and assume that the
total system is in a canonical state with temperature $T$. We analyse, under
what condition the state factors into a product of canonical density matrices
with respect to groups of $n$ subsystems each, and when these groups have the
same temperature $T$. In quantum systems the minimal group size
$n_{\textrm{min}}$ depends on the temperature $T$, contrary to the classical
case. As examples, we apply our analysis to a harmonic chain and different
types of Ising spin chains. For the harmonic chain, which successfully
describes thermal properties of insulating solids, our approach gives a first
quantitative estimate of the minimal length scale on which temperature can
exist: This length scale is found to be constant for temperatures above the
Debye temperature and proportional to $T^{-3}$ below. We finally apply the
harmonic chain model to various materials of relevance for technical
applications and discuss the results. These show that, indeed, high
temperatures can exist quite locally, while low temperatures exist on larger
scales only. This has striking consequences: In quasi 1-dimensional systems,
like Carbon-Nanotubes, room temperatures (300 Kelvin) exist on length scales of
1 $\mu$m, while very low temperatures (10 Kelvin) can only exist on scales
larger than 1 mm.

double-well potential. For large transition time we show that the quantum
action functional gives an analytical expression for tunneling amplitudes. This
has been confirmed by numerical simulations giving relative errors in the order
of 1e-5. In contrast to the classical potential, the quantum potential has a
triple-well if the classical wells are deep enough. Its minima are located at
the position of extrema of the ground state wave function. The striking feature
is that a single trajectory with a double instanton reproduces the tunneling
amplitude. This is in contrast to the standard instanton approach, where
infinitely many instantons and anti-instatons have to be taken into account.
The quantum action functional is valid in the deep quantum regime in contrast
to the semi-classical regime where the standard instanton approach holds. We
compare both approaches via numerical simulations. While the standard instanton
picture describes only the transition between potential minima of equal depth,
the quantum action may give rise to instantons also for asymmetric potential
minima. Such case is illustrated by an example.

communication altogether? Even though it cannot serve to signal information
between remote parties, there are distributed tasks that can be performed
without any need for communication, provided the parties share prior

  One of the earliest uses of multi-party entanglement was presented by Mermin

between different spacetime points can be established. Some entanglement
properties are obtained as constraints from symmetries, e.g., under Lorentz

  Inclusion of Two-Body Correlation</title><description>  We study a system of $A$ identical interacting bosons trapped by an external
field by solving ab initio the many-body Schroedinger equation. A complete
solution by using, for example, the traditional hyperspherical harmonics (HH)
basis develops serious problems due to the large degeneracy of HH basis,
symmetrization of the wave function, calculation of the matrix elements, etc.
for large $A$. Instead of the HH basis, here we use the &quot;potential harmonics&quot;
(PH) basis, which is a subset of HH basis. We assume that the contribution to
the orbital and grand orbital [in $3(A-1)$-dimensional space of the reduced
motion] quantum numbers comes only from the interacting pair. This implies
inclusion of two-body correlations only and disregard of all higher-body
correlations. Such an assumption is ideally suited for the Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC), which is extremely dilute. Unlike the $(3A-4)$ hyperspherical
variables in HH basis, the PH basis involves only three {\it{active}}
variables. It drastically reduces the number of coupled equations and
calculation of the potential matrix becomes tremendously simplified, as it
involves integrals over only three variables for any $A$. One can easily
incorporate realistic atom-atom interactions in a straight forward manner. We
study the ground and excited state properties of the condensate for both
attractive and repulsive interactions for various particle number.

level spacings of the defects are equal and much larger than all the others. We
investigate how the entanglement between the two defects depends on the
anisotropy of the system. When the anisotropy coupling is much larger than the
energy difference between a defect and an ordinary qubit, the two defects
become strongly entangled. Small anisotropies, on the contrary, may decrease
the entanglement, which is, in this case, also much affected by the number of
excitations. The analysis is made for nearest neighbor and next-nearest

set into one that can be efficiently modelled classically. This question is
useful for providing upper bounds on fault tolerant thresholds, and for
understanding the nature of the quantum/classical computational transition. We
refine some previously known upper bounds using two different strategies. The
first one involves the introduction of bi-entangling operations, a class of
classically simulatable machines that can generate at most bipartite
entanglement. Using this class we show that it is possible to sharpen
previously obtained upper bounds in certain cases. As an example, we show that
under depolarizing noise on the controlled-not gate, the previously known upper
bound of 74% can be sharpened to around 67%. Another interesting consequence is
that measurement based schemes cannot work using only 2-qubit non-degenerate
projections. In the second strand of the work we utilize the Gottesman-Knill
theorem on the classically efficient simulation of Clifford group operations.
The bounds attained for the pi/8 gate using this approach can be as low as 15%
for general single gate noise, and 30% for dephasing noise.

entanglement they can provide between the nearest and the next to nearest
neighbor spins in the ground state. We then investigate whether this
entanglement can be optimized by allowing the system to interact through a
weighted combination of the star and the ring geometries. We find that such a
weighted combination is indeed optimal in certain circumstances for providing
the highest entanglement between two chosen spins. The entanglement shows jumps
and counterintuitive behavior as the relative weighting of the star and the
ring interactions is varied. We give an exact mathematical explanation of the
behavior for a five qubit system (four spins in a ring and a central spin) and
an intuitive explanation for larger systems. For the case of four spins in a
ring plus a central spin, we demonstrate how a four qubit GHZ state can be
generated as a simple derivative of the ground state. Our calculations also
demonstrate that some of the multi-particle entangled states derivable from the
ground state of a star network are sufficiently robust to the presence of
nearest neighbor ring interactions.

Hamiltonian is a well-studied problem. Combinatorial schemes for decoupling and
for manipulating the couplings of Hamiltonians have been developed which use
selective pulses. In this paper we consider an additional requirement on these
pulse sequences: as few {\em different} control operations as possible should
be used. This requirement is motivated by the fact that optimizing each
individual selective pulse will be expensive, i. e., it is desirable to use as
few different selective pulses as possible. For an arbitrary $d$-dimensional
system we show that the ability to implement only two control operations is
sufficient to turn off the time evolution. In case of a bipartite system with
local control we show that four different control operations are sufficient.
Turning to networks consisting of several $d$-dimensional nodes which are
governed by a pair-interaction Hamiltonian, we show that decoupling can be
achieved if one is able to control a number of different control operations
which is logarithmic in the number of nodes.

 Arrays with two and three qubits are considered in detail. We show that the
creation of entanglement with an arbitrary number of qubits can be implemented,
without systematic errors, even when the coupling between qubits is not small.
A relatively large coupling constant allows one to increase the clock speed of
the quantum computer. We analytically and numerically demonstrate the creation
of the entanglement for this case, which can be a good test for the
experimental implementation of a relatively simple quantum protocol with many
qubits. We discuss a possible application of our approach for implementing
universal quantum logic for more complex algorithms by decreasing the coupling
constant and, correspondingly, decreasing the clock speed. The errors
introduced by the long-range interaction for the universal logic gates are

  Quantum Universe&quot;</title><description>  Based on a number of experimentally verified physical observations, it is
argued that the standard principles of quantum mechanics should be applied to
the Universe as a whole. Thus, a paradigm is proposed in which the entire
Universe is represented by a pure state wavefunction contained in a
factorisable Hilbert space of enormous dimension, and where this statevector is
developed by successive applications of operators that correspond to unitary
rotations and Hermitian tests. Moreover, because by definition the Universe
contains everything, it is argued that these operators must be chosen
self-referentially; the overall dynamics of the system is envisaged to be
analogous to a gigantic, self-governing, quantum computation. The issue of how
the Universe could choose these operators without requiring or referring to a
fictitious external observer is addressed.
  The processes by which conventional physics might be recovered from this
fundamental, mathematical and global description of reality are particularly
investigated. Specifically, it is demonstrated that by considering the changing
properties, separabilities and factorisations of both the state and the
operators as the Universe proceeds though a sequence of discrete computations,
familiar notions such as classical distinguishability, particle physics, space,
time, special relativity and endo-physical experiments can all begin to emerge
from the proposed picture. A pregeometric vision of cosmology is therefore
discussed, with all of physics ultimately arising from the relationships
occurring between the elements of the underlying mathematical structure.

to a bath. The initial state of the magnet is a metastable paramagnet, while
the bath starts in a thermal, gibbsian state. Conditions are such that the act
of measurement drives the magnet in the up or down ferromagnetic state
according to the sign of $s_z$ of the tested spin. The quantum measurement goes
in two steps. On a timescale $1/\sqrt{N}$ the off-diagonal elements of the
spin's density matrix vanish due to a unitary evolution of the tested spin and
the $N$ apparatus spins; on a larger but still short timescale this is made
definite by the bath. Then the system is in a `classical' state, having a
diagonal density matrix. The registration of that state is a quantum process
which can already be understood from classical statistical mechanics. The von
Neumann collapse and the Born rule are derived rather than postulated.

non-exponential decay for both the diagonal and non-diagonal matrix elements of

as the qubit and bath become entangled. These two rates are comparable, as was

Rev. A {\bf 62} (2000) 033821]. On the entanglement of a qubit with the EMF
under this type of resonant coupling we calculated, for the qubit reduced
density matrix, the fidelity and the von Neumann entropy, which is a measure of
the purity of the density matrix. The present more accurate non-Markovian
calculations predict lower loss of fidelity and purity as compared with the
Markovian results. Generally speaking, with the inclusion of quantum
correlations between the qubit and its environment, the non-Markovian processes
tend to slow down the drive of the system to equilibrium, prolonging the
decoherence and better preserving the fidelity and purity of the system.

entangled. As a tool for quantifying such systems, we introduce the concept of
the entanglement gap, which is the difference in energy between the
ground-state energy and the minimum energy that a separable (unentangled) state
may attain. If the energy of the system lies within the entanglement gap, the
state of the system is guaranteed to be entangled. We find Hamiltonians that
have the largest possible entanglement gap; for a system consisting of two
interacting spin-1/2 subsystems, the Heisenberg antiferromagnet is one such
example. We also introduce a related concept, the entanglement-gap temperature:
the temperature below which the thermal state is certainly entangled, as
witnessed by its energy. We give an example of a bipartite Hamiltonian with an
arbitrarily high entanglement-gap temperature for fixed total energy range. For
bipartite spin lattices we prove a theorem demonstrating that the entanglement
gap necessarily decreases as the coordination number is increased. We
investigate frustrated lattices and quantum phase transitions as physical
phenomena that affect the entanglement gap.

dissipating energy (i.e., pure phase damping), the amount of created particles
can be diminished significantly via the coupling to the environment (reservoir

Hong-Ou-Mandel experiment with coherent photons is reported. Pairs of
degenerate photons at telecom wavelength are created by parametric down
conversion in a periodically poled lithium niobate waveguide. The photon pairs
are separated in a beam-splitter and transmitted via two fibers of 25km. The
wave-packets are relatively delayed and recombined on a second beam-splitter,
forming a large Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Coincidence counts between the
photons at the two output modes are registered. The main challenge consists in
the trade-off between low count rates due to narrow filtering and length
fluctuations of the 25km long arms during the measurement. For balanced paths a
Hong-Ou-Mandel dip with a visibility of 47.3% is observed, which is close to
the maximal theoretical value of 50% developed here. This proves the
practicability of a long distance Bell state measurement with two independent
sources, as e.g. required in an entanglement swapping configuration in the

different experimental setups&quot;, this article investigates the notion of
relativity in Bohr's sense, starting from a set of binary elements. The most
general form of information coding within such sets requires a description by
four-component states. By using Bohr's dictum as a guideline a quantum
mechanical description of the set is obtained in the form of a SO(3,2) based
spin network.
  For large (macroscopic) sub-networks a flat-space approximation of SO(3,2)
leads to a Poincare symmetrical Hilbert space. The concept of a position of
four-component spinors relative to macroscopic sub-networks then delivers the
description of 'free' massive spin-1/2 particles with a Poincare symmetrical
Hilbert space.
  Hence Minkowskian space-time, equipped with spin-1/2 particles, is obtained
as an inherent property of a system of binary elements when individual elements
are described relative to macroscopic sub-systems.

the bulk logarithmic entanglement entropy (S_{ent} ~ ln(L/e)) scales as \delta

the qubit level separation. Fluctuations in the photon number (shot noise)
induce level fluctuations in the qubit leading to dephasing which is the

corresponding to a random choice within an ensemble of measuring apparatuses.
Such mixing is equivalent to a sort of hidden variable, which produces a noise
of purely classical nature. It is then natural to ask which apparatuses are
&quot;indecomposable&quot;, i. e. do not correspond to any random choice of apparatuses.
This problem is interesting not only for foundations, but also for
applications, since most optimization strategies give optimal apparatuses that
are indecomposable.
  Mathematically the problem is posed describing each measuring apparatus by a
positive operator-valued measure (POVM), which gives the statistics of the
outcomes for any input state. The POVM's form a convex set, and in this
language the indecomposable apparatuses are represented by extremal points--the
analogous of &quot;pure states&quot; in the convex set of states. Differently from the
case of states, however, indecomposable POVM's are not necessarily rank-one, e.
g. von Neumann measurements.
  In this paper we give a complete classification of indecomposable apparatuses

generalisation of coin tossing in which two mistrustful parties wish to
generate a string of random bits such that an honest party can be sure that the
other cannot have biased the string too much. We consider a quantum protocol
for this task, originally introduced in Phys. Rev. A {\bf 69}, 022322 (2004),
that is feasible with present day technology. We introduce security conditions
based on the average bias of the bits and the Shannon entropy of the string.
For each, we prove rigorous security bounds for this protocol in both noiseless
and noisy conditions under the most general attacks allowed by quantum
mechanics. Roughly speaking, in the absence of noise, a cheater can only bias
significantly a vanishing fraction of the bits, whereas in the presence of
noise, a cheater can bias a constant fraction, with this fraction depending
quantitatively on the level of noise. We also discuss classical protocols for
the same task, deriving upper bounds on how well a classical protocol can
perform. This enables the determination of how much noise the quantum protocol
can tolerate while still outperforming classical protocols. We raise several
conjectures concerning both quantum and classical possibilities for large n
cryptography. An experiment corresponding to the scheme analysed in this paper
has been performed and is reported elsewhere.

  Implementations of the Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol for Quantum
  Cryptography</title><description>  In practical quantum cryptography, the source sometimes produces multi-photon
pulses, thus enabling the eavesdropper Eve to perform the powerful
photon-number-splitting (PNS) attack. Recently, it was shown by Curty and
Lutkenhaus [Phys. Rev. A 69, 042321 (2004)] that the PNS attack is not always
the optimal attack when two photons are present: if errors are present in the
correlations Alice-Bob and if Eve cannot modify Bob's detection efficiency, Eve
gains a larger amount of information using another attack based on a 2-&gt;3
cloning machine. In this work, we extend this analysis to all distances
Alice-Bob. We identify a new incoherent 2-&gt;3 cloning attack which performs
better than those described before. Using it, we confirm that, in the presence
of errors, Eve's better strategy uses 2-&gt;3 cloning attacks instead of the PNS.
However, this improvement is very small for the implementations of the
Bennett-Brassard 1984 (BB84) protocol. Thus, the existence of these new attacks
is conceptually interesting but basically does not change the value of the
security parameters of BB84. The main results are valid both for Poissonian and
sub-Poissonian sources.

one can define the zero-point energy and the free energy of the electromagnetic
waves in it: this can be done, independently of the nature of the boundaries,
in the limit that they become perfect conductors, provided their curvature is
finite. The first examples we consider are Casimir's original configuration of
parallel plates, and the experimental situation of a sphere in front of a
plate. For arbitrary geometries, we give an explicit expression for the
zero-point energy and the free energy in terms of an integral kernel acting on
the boundaries; it can be expanded in a convergent series interpreted as a
succession of an even number of scatterings of a wave. The quantum and thermal
fluctuations of vacuum then appear as a purely geometric property. The Casimir
effect thus defined exists only owing to the electromagnetic nature of the
field. It does not exist for thin foils with sharp folds, but Casimir forces
between solid wedges are finite. We work out various applications: low
temperature, high temperature where wrinkling constraints appear, stability of
a plane foil, transfer of energy from one side of a curved boundary to the
other, forces between distant conductors, special shapes (parallel plates,
sphere, cylinder, honeycomb).

quantum system in course of the decoherence process. Redundant spreading of
information -- the fact that some observables of the system can be
independently ``read-off'' from many distinct fragments of the environment --
is investigated as the key to effective objectivity, the essential ingredient
of ``classical reality''. This focus on the environment as a communication
channel through which observers learn about physical systems underscores
importance of quantum Darwinism -- selective proliferation of information about
``the fittest states'' chosen by the dynamics of decoherence at the expense of
their superpositions -- as redundancy imposes the existence of preferred
observables. We demonstrate that the only observables that can leave multiple
imprints in the environment are the familiar pointer observables singled out by
environment-induced superselection (einselection) for their predictability.
Many independent observers monitoring the environment will therefore agree on
properties of the system as they can only learn about preferred observables. In
this operational sense, the selective spreading of information leads to
appearance of an objective ``classical reality'' from within quantum substrate.

produced by self-phase modulation effect in electronic Kerr media and its

polarization is treated in terms of four quantum Stokes parameters whose
spectra of quantum fluctuations are investigated. We show that the frequency at
which the suppression of quantum fluctuations of Stokes parameters is the
greatest can be controlled by adjusting the linear phase difference between
pulses. By varying the intensity of one pulse one can suppress effectively the
quantum fluctuations of Stokes parameters. We study the overlap of nonclassical
pulses inside of an anisotropic electronic Kerr medium and we show that the
cross-phase modulation effect can be employed to control the
polarization-squeezed state of light. Moreover, we establish that the change of
the intensity or of the nonlinear phase shift per photon for one pulse controls
effectively the squeezing of Stokes parameters. The spatial overlap of a
coherent pulse field with an interference pulse produced by mixing two
quadrature-squeezed pulses on a beam splitter is analyzed. It is found that
squeezing is produced in three of the four Stokes parameters, with the
squeezing in the first two being simultaneous.

designed to overcome both decoherence and operational errors. This is important
for coherent control of quantum systems such as quantum computers. For
bounded-strength, non-Markovian environments, such as for the spin-bath that
arises in electron- and nuclear-spin based solid-state quantum computer
proposals, we show that it is strictly advantageous to use concatenated, as
opposed to standard periodic dynamical decoupling pulse sequences. Namely, the
concatenated scheme is both fault-tolerant and super-polynomially more
efficient, at equal cost. We derive a condition on the pulse noise level below
which concatenated is guaranteed to reduce decoherence.

manipulation of pure dynamical states of the system by means of unitary
transformations. Recently, Vilela Mendes and Mank'o have shown that the
conditions for controllability on the state space become less restrictive if
unitary control operations may be supplemented by projective measurement. The
present work builds on this idea, introducing the additional element of
indirect measurement to achieve a kind of remote control. The target system
that is to be remotely controlled is first entangled with another identical
system, called the control system. The control system is then subjected to
unitary transformations plus projective measurement. As anticipated by
Schrodinger, such control via entanglement is necessarily probabilistic in
nature. On the other hand, under appropriate conditions the remote-control
scenario offers the special advantages of robustness against decoherence and a
greater repertoire of unitary transformations. Simulations carried out for a
two-level system demonstrate that, with optimization of control parameters, a
substantial gain in the population of reachable states can be realized.

we introduce pseudo-Hermitian position and momentum operators and a

Given a linear differential operator of order 2S, acting on functions

estimate a low order eigenvalue to accuracy Theta(1/N^2) is
Theta((2(S+1)(1+1/nu)+D)log N) qubits and O(N^{2(S+1)(1+1/nu)} (D log N)^c)

discretized, nu and c are implementation dependent constants of O(1). Optimal
classical methods require Theta(N^D) bits and Omega(N^D) gate operations to
perform the same eigenvalue estimation. The Abrams-Lloyd algorithm thereby
leads to exponential reduction in memory and polynomial reduction in gate
operations, provided the domain has sufficiently large dimension D &gt;
2(S+1)(1+1/nu). In the case of Schrodinger's equation, ground state energy

  in many-spin environments</title><description>  As quantum information science approaches the goal of constructing quantum
computers, understanding loss of information through decoherence becomes
increasingly important. The information about a system that can be obtained
from its environment can facilitate quantum control and error correction.
Moreover, observers gain most of their information indirectly, by monitoring
(primarily photon) environments of the &quot;objects of interest.&quot; Exactly how this
information is inscribed in the environment is essential for the emergence of
&quot;the classical&quot; from the quantum substrate. In this paper, we examine how
many-qubit (or many-spin) environments can store information about a single
system. The information lost to the environment can be stored redundantly, or
it can be encoded in entangled modes of the environment. We go on to show that
randomly chosen states of the environment almost always encode the information
so that an observer must capture a majority of the environment to deduce the
system's state. Conversely, in the states produced by a typical decoherence
process, information about a particular observable of the system is stored
redundantly. This selective proliferation of &quot;the fittest information&quot; (known
as Quantum Darwinism) plays a key role in choosing the preferred, effectively
classical observables of macroscopic systems. The developing appreciation that
the environment functions not just as a garbage dump, but as a communication
channel, is extending our understanding of the environment's role in the
quantum-classical transition beyond the traditional paradigm of decoherence.

  Quantum Channels</title><description>  Introducing contravariant trace-densities for quantum states, we restore one
to one correspondence between quantum operations described by normal CP maps
and their trace densities as Hermitian positive operator-valued contravariant
kernels. The CB-norm distance between two quantum operations with type one
input algebras is explicitly expressed in terms of these densities, and this
formula is also extended to a generalized CB-distances between quantum
operations with type two inputs. A larger C-distance is given as the natural
norm-distance for the channel densities, and another, Helinger type distance,
related to minimax mean square optimization problem for purification of quantum
channels, is also introduced and evaluated in terms of their contravariant
trace-densities. It is proved that the Helinger type complete fidelity distance
between two channels is equivalent to the CB distance at least for type one
inputs, and this equivalence is also extended to type two for the generalized
CB distance. An operational meaning for these distances and relative complete
fidelity for quantum channels is given in terms of quantum encodings as
generalized entanglements of quantum states opposite to the inputs and the
output states.

reliable source of two entangled systems. Such systems have been generated
experimentally several years ago for light but has only in the past few years
been demonstrated for atomic systems. None of these approaches however involve
two atomic systems situated in separate environments. This is necessary for the
creation of entanglement over arbitrary distances which is required for many
quantum information protocols such as atomic teleportation. We present an
experimental realization of such distant entanglement based on an adaptation of
the entanglement of macroscopic gas samples containing about 10^11 cesium atoms
shown previously by our group. The entanglement is generated via the
off-resonant Kerr interaction between the atomic samples and a pulse of light.
The achieved entanglement distance is 0.35m but can be scaled arbitrarily. The
feasibility of an implementation of various quantum information protocols using
macroscopic samples of atoms has therefore been greatly increased. We also
present a theoretical modeling in terms of canonical position and momentum
operators X and P describing the entanglement generation and verification in
presence of decoherence mechanisms.

the treatment of light diffraction by a thin phase grating, and consists in
calculating the atomic wavefunction by means of action integrals along the
classical trajectories of the atoms in the absence of the modulated part of the
potential. The capabilities and the validity condition of the method are
illustrated on the well-known case of atomic diffraction by a Gaussian standing

the Raman-Nath approximation, and we point out that the usually-considered

entanglement for GHZ-type superposition states decreases with the size of the
system, while for a class of other states -namely all graph states with
constant degree- the lifetime is independent of the system size. We show that
these results are largely independent of the specific decoherence model and are
in particular valid for all models which deal with individual couplings of
particles to independent environments, described by some quantum optical master
equation of Lindblad form. For GHZ states, we derive analytic expressions for
the lifetime of distillable entanglement and determine when the state becomes
fully separable. For all graph states, we derive lower and upper bounds on the
lifetime of entanglement. To this aim, we establish a method to calculate the
spectrum of the partial transposition for all mixed states which are diagonal
in a graph state basis. We also consider entanglement between different groups
of particles and determine the corresponding lifetimes as well as the change of
the kind of entanglement with time. This enables us to investigate the behavior
of entanglement under re-scaling and in the limit of large (infinite) number of
particles. Finally we investigate the lifetime of encoded quantum superposition
states and show that one can define an effective time in the encoded system

an alternative view on quantum error correction and examples of states whose

  quantum computing</title><description>  Most of the work on implementing arithmetic on a quantum computer has
borrowed from results in classical reversible computing (e.g. [VBE95], [BBF02],
[DKR04]). These quantum networks are inherently classical, as they can be
implemented with only the Toffoli gate. Draper [D00] has proposed an inherently
&quot;quantum&quot; network for addition based on the quantum Fourier transform. His
approach has the advantage that it requires no carry qubits (the previous
approaches required O(n) carry qubits). The network in [D00] uses quantum
rotation gates, which must either be implemented with exponential precision, or
else be approximated. In this paper I give a network of O(n^3) Toffoli gates
for reversibly performing in-place addition with only a single ancillary bit,
demonstrating that inherently quantum techniques are not required to achieve
this goal (provided we are willing to sacrifice quadratic circuit depth). After
posting the original version of this note it was pointed out to me by C. Zalka
that essentially the same technique for addition was used in [BCD+96]. The
scenario in that paper was different, but it is clear how the technique they
described generalizes to that in this paper.

equation with a Dirichlet boundary condition to a function satisfying a Robin
(generalized Neumann) condition. In the simplest cases this observation enables
the exact construction of the Green functions for the wave, heat, and
Schrodinger problems with a Robin boundary condition. The resulting physical
picture is that the field can exchange energy with the boundary, and a delayed
reflection from the boundary results. In more general situations the method
allows at least approximate and local construction of the appropriate reflected
solutions, and hence a &quot;classical path&quot; analysis of the Green functions and the
associated spectral information. By this method we solve the wave equation on
an interval with one Robin and one Dirichlet endpoint, and thence derive
several variants of a Gutzwiller-type expansion for the density of eigenvalues.
The variants are consistent except for an interesting subtlety of
distributional convergence that affects only the neighborhood of zero in the
frequency variable.

particular, the robustness of N-party entanglement is studied in the large N
limit when (a) the number of spatially separated subsystems is fixed but the
size of each subsystem becomes large (b) the size of the subsystems is fixed

Some degree of the correlation between the photon-number fluctuations of stable

by the action of non- conservative terms in the CGLE. Photon-number-correlated

nonclassical momentum fluctuations, with the fluctuation uncertainty fully
determined by the position uncertainty, has been shown to lead from the
classical equations of motion to the Schroedinger equation. This 'exact
uncertainty' approach may be generalised to ensembles of gravitational fields,
where nonclassical fluctuations are added to the field momentum densities, of a
magnitude determined by the uncertainty in the metric tensor components. In
this way one obtains the Wheeler-DeWitt equation of quantum gravity, with the
added bonus of a uniquely specified operator ordering. No a priori assumptions
are required concerning the existence of wavefunctions, Hilbert spaces,
Planck's constant, linear operators, etc. Thus this approach has greater
transparency than the usual canonical approach, particularly in regard to the
connections between quantum and classical ensembles. Conceptual foundations and
advantages are emphasised.

  channels</title><description>  The paper is devoted to systematic study of the $\chi$-capacity (underlying
the classical capacity) of infinite dimensional quantum channels. An essential
feature of this case is the natural appearance of the input constraints and
infinite, in general, ``continuous'' state ensembles, defined as probability
measures on the set of all quantum states. By using compactness criteria from
probability theory and operator theory it is shown that the set of all
generalized ensembles with the average (barycenter) in a compact set of states
is itself a compact subset of the set of all probability measures. With this in
hand we give a sufficient condition for the existence of an optimal generalized
ensemble for a constrained quantum channel. This condition can be verified in
the case of Bosonic Gaussian channels with constrained mean energy. The
importance of the above condition is shown by considering example of a
constrained channel with no optimal generalized ensemble. In the case of convex
constraints a characterization of the optimal generalized ensemble is obtained
extending the `` maximal distance'' property.

a specific application, we present a novel protocol for quantum key
distribution (QKD) which enhances the BB84 scheme by encrypting the information
sent over the classical channel during key sifting. We show that, in the limit
of long keys, this process prevents an eavesdropper from reproducing the

eavesdropper to sift the information gathered by tapping the quantum channel
reduces the amount of information that an eavesdropper can gain on the sifted

allows the growing of a secret key.

bouncing wave packets. We show how difference or mirror solutions of the form
psi(x,t)-psi(-x,t) can, in this case, be normalized exactly, allowing for the
evaluation of a number of time-dependent expectation values and other

illustrates how the free-particle kinetic (and hence total) energy is affected
by the presence of the distant boundary. We also discuss the time dependence of
the expectation values of position, &lt;x&gt;_t, and momentum, &lt;p&gt;_t, and their
relation to the impulsive force during the `collision' with the wall. Finally,
the x_0,p_0 --&gt; 0 limit is shown to reduce to a special case of a non-standard

then expands on the relatively small number of Gaussian solutions to quantum

complementarity. In the opposite to the Bohr's principle, our principle has no
direct relation with mutual exclusivity for observables. To distinguish our
principle from the Bohr's principle and to give better characterization, we
change the terminology and speak about supplementarity, instead of
complementarity. Supplementarity is based on the interference of probabilities.
It has quantitative expression trough a coefficient which can be easily
calculated from experimental statistical data.
 We need not appeal to the Hilbert space formalism and noncommutativity of

of supplementary observables which can not be represented in the complex
Hilbert space. There are discussed applications of the principle of

of entanglement (REE) for a given concurrence as well as the negativity for a
given concurrence are reached by pure states. We show that, by contrast, there
are two-qubit mixed states for which the REE for some range of a fixed
negativity is higher than that for pure states. Moreover, we demonstrate that a
mixture of a pure entangled state and pure separable state orthogonal to it is
likely to give the maximal REE. By noting that the negativity is a measure of
entanglement cost under operations preserving positivity of partial transpose,
our results provide an explicit example of operations such that, even though
the entanglement cost for an exact preparation is the same, the entanglement of
distillation of a mixed state can exceed that of pure states. This means that
the entanglement manipulation via a pure state can result in a larger
entanglement loss than that via a mixed state.

  With Spontaneous Superposition Breaking</title><description>  Developing an earlier proposal (Ne'eman, Damnjanovic, etc), we show herein
that there is a Landau continuous phase transition from the exact quantum
dynamics to the effectively classical one, occurring via spontaneous
superposition breaking (effective hiding), as a special case of the
corresponding general formalism (Bernstein). Critical values of the order
parameters for this transition are determined by Heisenberg's indeterminacy
relations, change continuously, and are in excellent agreement with the recent
and remarkable experiments with Bose condensation. It is also shown that such a
phase transition can sucessfully model self-collapse (self-decoherence), as an
effective classical phenomenon, on the measurement device. This then induces a
relative collapse (relative decoherence) as an effective quantum phenomenon on
the measured quantum object by measurement.
  We demonstrate this (including the case of Bose-Einstein condensation) in the
well-known cases of the Stern-Gerlach spin measurement, Bell's inequality and
the recently discussed quantum superposition on a mirror a la Marshall et al.
These results provide for a proof that quantum mechanics, in distinction to all
absolute collapse and hidden-variable theories, is local and objective. There
now appear no insuperable obstacles to solving the open problems in quantum
theory of measurement and foundation of quantum mechanics, and strictly within
the standard quantum-mechanical formalism. Simply put, quantum mechanics is a
field theory over the Hilbert space, the classical mechanics characteristics of
which emerge through spontaneous superposition breaking.

In this IIPS, the common momentum and common variable of a massive fermion turn

straightforward to show an uncertainty relation between fermion mass and proper

and the fermion field equations are derivable from the Lagrangians. Finally,
the nonlinear QED equations and Lagrangians are presented as an example.

  weak measurement</title><description>  The model of weak measurements is applied to various problems, related to the
time problem in quantum mechanics. The review and generalization of the
theoretical analysis of the time problem in quantum mechanics based on the
concept of weak measurements are presented. A question of the time interval the
system spends in the specified state, when the final state of the system is
given, is raised. Using the concept of weak measurements the expression for
such time is obtained. The results are applied to the tunneling problem. A
procedure for the calculation of the asymptotic tunneling and reflection times
is proposed. Examples for delta-form and rectangular barrier illustrate the
obtained results. Using the concept of weak measurements the arrival time
probability distribution is defined by analogy with the classical mechanics.
The proposed procedure is suitable to the free particles and to particles
subjected to an external potential, as well. It is shown that such an approach
imposes an inherent limitation to the accuracy of the arrival time definition.

i.e., vectors in n-dim Hilbert space, H^n, n&gt;3 to which it is impossible to
assign 1s and 0s in such a way that no two mutually orthogonal vectors from the
set are both assigned 1 and that not all mutually orthogonal vectors are
assigned 0. Our constructive definition of such KS vectors is based on
algorithms that generate MMP diagrams corresponding to blocks of orthogonal
vectors in R^n, on algorithms that single out those diagrams on which algebraic
0-1 states cannot be defined, and on algorithms that solve nonlinear equations
describing the orthogonalities of the vectors by means of statistically
polynomially complex interval analysis and self-teaching programs. The
algorithms are limited neither by the number of dimensions nor by the number of

systems containing up to 24 vectors were generated and described, all 3-dim
vector systems containing up to 30 vectors were scanned, and several general

at the time-dependent wave equation. Although the former equation was
originally used by E.Schroedinger to get the wave equation, we propose a
different approach. In the first place, we do not use the principle of least
action and, in addition, we arrive at the time-dependent equation, while
Schroedinger (in his first seminal paper) used the least action principle and
obtained the stationary wave equation. The proposed approach works for any
classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In addition, by introducing information
loss into the Hamilton-Jacobi equation we derive in an elementary fashion the
wave equations (ranging from the Shroedinger to Klein-Gordon, to Dirac
equations). We also apply this technique to a relativistic particle in the
gravitational field and obtain the respective wave equation. All this supports
't Hooft's proposal about a possibility of arriving at quantum description from
a classical continuum in the presence of information loss.

rich variety of dynamical behavior depending on parameters, displays
interesting phenomena such as fractal spectra, mixed phase space, dynamical
localization, anomalous diffusion, or partial delocalization, and can describe
electrons in a magnetic field. Three different quantum algorithms are presented
and analyzed, enabling to simulate efficiently the evolution operator of this
system with different precision using different resources. Depending on the
parameters chosen, the system is near-integrable, localized, or partially
delocalized. In each case we identify transport or spectral quantities which
can be obtained more efficiently on a quantum computer than on a classical one.
In most cases, a polynomial gain compared to classical algorithms is obtained,
which can be quadratic or less depending on the parameter regime. We also
present the effects of static imperfections on the quantities selected, and
show that depending on the regime of parameters, very different behaviors are
observed. Some quantities can be obtained reliably with moderate levels of
imperfection, whereas others are exponentially sensitive to imperfection
strength. In particular, the imperfection threshold for delocalization becomes
exponentially small in the partially delocalized regime. Our results show that
interesting behavior can be observed with as little as 7-8 qubits, and can be
reliably measured in presence of moderate levels of internal imperfections.

model with a random gauge coupling; the random-plaquette gauge model(RPGM). The
random gauge coupling at each plaquette takes the value J with the probability
1-p and -J with p. This model exhibits a confinement-Higgs phase transition. We
numerically obtain a phase boundary curve in the (p-T)-plane where T is the
&quot;temperature&quot; measured in unit of J/k_B. This model plays an important role in
estimating the accuracy threshold of a quantum memory of a toric code. In this
paper, we are mainly interested in its &quot;self-duality&quot; aspect, and the
relationship with the random-bond Ising model(RBIM) in 2-dimensions. The
&quot;self-duality&quot; argument can be applied both for RPGM and RBIM, giving the same
duality equations, hence predicting the same phase boundary. The phase boundary
curve obtained by our numerical simulation almost coincides with this predicted
phase boundary at the high-temperature region. The phase transition is of first
order for relatively small values of p &lt; 0.08, but becomes of second order for
larger p. The value of p at the intersection of the phase boundary curve and
the Nishimori line is regarded as the accuracy threshold of errors in a toric
quantum memory. It is estimated as p=0.110\pm0.002, which is very close to the
value conjectured by Takeda and Nishimori through the &quot;self-duality&quot; argument.

cluster states arise as a special case and we show that while one measure of
entanglement is large, another measure can be exponentially small, while
symmetrizing these states with respect to up and down spins, produces those
with large entanglement content uniformly. We also calculate exactly some
entanglement measures for the nontrivial but integrable case of the kicked
transverse Ising model. In the nonintegrable case we begin on extensive
numerical studies that shows that large multipartite entanglement is
accompanied by diminishing two-body correlations, and that time averaged
multipartite entanglement measures can be enhanced in nonintegrable systems.

and convenient access to the (complete) spectrum of atoms and ions. Having
these functions available, they may help carry out perturbation expansions to
any order beyond the first one. For most realistic potentials, however, the
Green's functions need to be calculated numerically since an analytic form is
known only for free electrons or for their motion in a pure Coulomb field.
Therefore, in order to facilitate the use of Green's functions also for atoms
and ions other than the hydrogen--like ions, here we provide an extension to
the Ratip program which supports the computation of relativistic
(one--electron) Green's functions in an -- arbitrarily given -- central--field
potential $\rV(r)$. Different computational modes have been implemented to
define these effective potentials and to generate the radial Green's functions
for all bound--state energies $E &lt; 0$. In addition, care has been taken to
provide a user--friendly component of the Ratip package by utilizing features
of the Fortran 90/95 standard such as data structures, allocatable arrays, or a
module--oriented design.

  protocols</title><description>  A necessary precondition for secure quantum key distribution (QKD) is that
sender and receiver can prove the presence of entanglement in a quantum state
that is effectively distributed between them. In order to deliver this
entanglement proof one can use the class of entanglement witness (EW) operators
that can be constructed from the available measurements results. This class of
EWs can be used to provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the
existence of quantum correlations even when a quantum state cannot be
completely reconstructed. The set of optimal EWs for two well-known
entanglement based (EB) schemes, the 6-state and the 4-state EB protocols, has
been obtained recently [M. Curty et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 217903 (2004)].
Here we complete these results, now showing specifically the analysis for the
case of prepare&amp;measure (P&amp;M) schemes. For this, we investigate the signal
states and detection methods of the 4-state and the 2-state P&amp;M schemes. For
each of these protocols we obtain a reduced set of EWs. More importantly, each
set of EWs can be used to derive a necessary and sufficient condition to prove
that quantum correlations are present in these protocols.

through a Faraday isolator and into a second cavity which is coupled to the
source cavity by a nonlinear crystal. If the driven cavity is heavily damped,
then it can be adiabatically eliminated and a master equation or quantum
Langevin equation derived for the first cavity alone. This is done for an input
bath in an arbitrary state, and for an arbitrary nonlinear coupling. If the
intercavity coupling involves only the intensity (or one quadrature) of the
driven cavity, then the effect on the source cavity is identical to that which
can be obtained from electro-optical feedback using direct (or homodyne)
detection. If the coupling involves both quadratures, this equivalence no
longer holds, and a coupling linear in the source amplitude can produce a
nonclassical state in the source cavity. The analogous electro-optic scheme
using heterodyne detection introduces extra noise which prevents the production
of nonclassical light. Unlike the electro-optic case, the all-optical feedback
loop has an output beam (reflected from the second cavity). We show that this
may be squeezed, even if the source cavity remains in a classical state.

and quantum computing have increasingly taught us that it can be helpful to
think about physics itself in computational terms. For example, work over the
last decade has shown that the energy of a quantum system limits the rate at
which it can perform significant computational operations, and suggests that we
might validly interpret energy as in fact being the speed at which a physical
system is &quot;computing,&quot; in some appropriate sense of the word. In this paper, we
explore the precise nature of this connection. Elementary results in quantum
theory show that the Hamiltonian energy of any quantum system corresponds
exactly to the angular velocity of state-vector rotation (defined in a certain
natural way) in Hilbert space, and also to the rate at which the state-vector's
components (in any basis) sweep out area in the complex plane. The total angle
traversed (or area swept out) corresponds to the action of the Hamiltonian
operator along the trajectory, and we can also consider it to be a measure of
the &quot;amount of computational effort exerted&quot; by the system, or effort for
short. For any specific quantum or classical computational operation, we can
(at least in principle) calculate its difficulty, defined as the minimum effort
required to perform that operation on a worst-case input state, and this in
turn determines the minimum time required for quantum systems to carry out that
operation on worst-case input states of a given energy. As examples, we
calculate the difficulty of some basic 1-bit and n-bit quantum and classical
operations in an simple unconstrained scenario.

Theorem only applied to local theories that violated Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle. By explicitly introducing time into our derivation of Bell's
theorem, an extra term related to the time-ordering of actual measurements is
found to augment (i.e. weaken) the upper bound of the inequality. Since the
same locality assumptions hold for this rederivation as for the original, we
conclude that only {\em classical} measurement-order independent local hidden
variable theories are constrained by Bell's inequality; time dependent,
non-classical local theories (i.e. theories respecting Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle) can satisfy this new bound while exceeding Bell's limit.
Unconditional nonlocality is only expected to occur with Bell parameters
between $2\sqrt{2}$ and 4. This weakening of Bell's inequality is seen for the
quantum Bell operator (squared) as an extra term involving the commutators of
{\em local} measurement operators. We note that a factorizable second-quantized
wavefunction can reproduce experimental measurements; because such
wavefunctions allow local de Broglie-Bohm hidden variable modelling, we have
another indication that violation of {\em Bell's} inequality does not require
an acceptance of non-locality.

connection is obtained via the matrix Riccati equation that governs the time
evolution of squeezed states of the harmonic oscillator. It is also shown that
the inclusion of gravity leads to a resonant behavior -- the particles are
expelled from the trap.

lattice. For states that are an equal superposition of elements of a group $G$
of spin flips acting on the fully polarized state $\ket{0}^{\otimes n}$, we
find that the von Neumann entropy depends only on the boundary between the two
subsystems $A$ and $B$. These states are stabilized by the group $G$. A
physical realization of such states is given by the ground state manifold of
the Kitaev's model on a Riemann surface of genus $\mathfrak{g}$. For a square
lattice, we find that the entropy of entanglement is bounded from above and
below by functions linear in the perimeter of the subsystem $A$ and is equal to
the perimeter (up to an additive constant) when $A$ is convex. The entropy of
entanglement is shown to be related to the topological order of this model.
Finally, we find that some of the ground states are absolutely entangled, i.e.,
no partition has zero entanglement. We also provide several examples for the
square lattice.

I(\omega) = {const} \times \ln (\frac{1}{\omega})$, at $\omega \to 0$, and
exponentially decaying asymptotics in a high frequency domain. For the Gaussian

(QKD) do not apply to joint attacks over QKD and the subsequent use of the
resulting key. In this paper, we close this potential security gap by using a
universal composability theorem for the quantum setting. We first derive a
composable security definition for QKD. We then prove that the usual security
definition of QKD still implies the composable security definition. Thus, a key
produced in any QKD protocol that is unconditionally secure in the usual
definition can indeed be safely used, a property of QKD that is hitherto
unproven. We propose two other useful sufficient conditions for composability.
As a simple application of our result, we show that keys generated by repeated
runs of QKD degrade slowly.

Bose-Einstein condensates loaded in a one-dimensional spin-dependent optical
lattice, which is based on an assumption that for the atoms in the entangled
single-atom state between the internal and the external degrees of freedom each
atom interferes only with itself. Our theoretical results agree well with the
interference patterns observed in a recent experiment by Mandel et al. [Phys.

nonuniform phase distribution is proposed to test further our theoretical model

is sufficient for the interference of the condensates confined in a
spin-dependent optical lattice and this interference is irrelevant with the
phases of individual condensates, i.e., this interference arises only between
each condensate and itself and there is no interference effect between two

One exception is in the realm of Statistical Physics, where the calculation of
the partition function, for example, is essentially a combinatorial problem. In
this talk we shall show that one approach is via the normal ordering of the
second quantized operators appearing in the partition function. This in turn
leads to a combinatorial graphical description, giving essentially Feynman-type
graphs associated with the theory. We illustrate this methodology by the
explicit calculation of two model examples, the free boson gas and a superfluid
boson model. We show how the calculation of partition functions can be
facilitated by knowledge of the combinatorics of the boson normal ordering
problem; this naturally gives rise to the Bell numbers of combinatorics. The
associated graphical representation of these numbers gives a perturbation
expansion in terms of a sequence of graphs analogous to zero - dimensional
Feynman diagrams.

instances of 3-SAT (an NP-complete problem) in terms of Random Matrix Theory
(RMT). We determine the global regularity of the spectral fluctuations of the
instantaneous Hamiltonians encountered during the interpolation between the
starting Hamiltonians and the ones whose ground states encode the solutions to
the computational problems of interest. At each interpolation point, we
quantify the degree of regularity of the average spectral distribution via its
Brody parameter, a measure that distinguishes regular (i.e., Poissonian) from
chaotic (i.e., Wigner-type) distributions of normalized nearest-neighbor
spacings. We find that for hard problem instances, i.e., those having a
critical ratio of clauses to variables, the spectral fluctuations typically
become irregular across a contiguous region of the interpolation parameter,
while the spectrum is regular for easy instances. Within the hard region, RMT
may be applied to obtain a mathematical model of the probability of avoided
level crossings and concomitant failure rate of the adiabatic algorithm due to
non-adiabatic Landau-Zener type transitions. Our model predicts that if the
interpolation is performed at a uniform rate, the average failure rate of the
quantum adiabatic algorithm, when averaged over hard problem instances, scales
exponentially with increasing problem size.

They possess
numerous applications in quantum information science. It is well-known that in
prime power dimensions N=p^m (with p prime and m a positive integer) there
exists a maximal set of N+1 mutually unbiased bases.
 In the present paper, we derive an explicit expression for those bases, in
terms of the (operations of the) associated finite field (Galois division ring)
of N elements. This expression is shown to be equivalent to the expressions
previously obtained by Ivanovic in odd prime dimensions (J. Phys. A, 14, 3241

power dimensions. In even prime power dimensions, we derive a new explicit
expression for the mutually unbiased bases. The new ingredients of our approach
are, basically, the following: we provide a simple expression of the
generalised Pauli group in terms of the additive characters of the field and we
derive an exact groupal composition law inside the elements of the commuting
subsets of the generalised Pauli group, renormalised by a well-chosen

asymptotically approaching kappa 2^{-gamma m} in Frobenius norm, centered at
the identity matrix, of separable (unentangled) positive semidefinite matrices,
for an exponent gamma = (1/2)((ln 3/ln 2) - 1), roughly .29248125. This is much
smaller in magnitude than the best previously known exponent, from our earlier
work, of 1/2. For normalized m-qubit states, we get a separable ball of radius
sqrt(3^(m+1)/(3^m+3)) * 2^{-(1 + \gamma)m}, i.e. sqrt{3^{m+1}/(3^m+3)}\times
6^{-m/2} (note that \kappa = \sqrt{3}), compared to the previous 2 * 2^{-3m/2}.
This implies that with parameters realistic for current experiments, NMR with
standard pseudopure-state preparation techniques can access only unentangled
states if 36 qubits or fewer are used (compared to 23 qubits via our earlier

condensates can spontaneously appear under the effect of measurements. We first
consider a system that is the juxtaposition of two subsystems in Fock states
with high populations, and assume that successive individual position
measurements are performed. Initially, the relative phase is totally undefined,
and no interference effect takes place in the first position measurement. But,
while successive measurements are accumulated, the relative phase becomes
better and better known, and a clear interference pattern emerges. It turns out
that all observed results can be interpreted in terms of a pre-existing, but
totally unknown, relative phase, which remains exactly constant during the
experiment. We then generalize the results to more condensates. We also
consider other initial quantum states than pure Fock states, and distinguish
between intrinsic phase of a quantum state and phase induced by measurements.
Finally, we examine the case of multiple condensates of spin states. We discuss
a curious quantum effect, where the measurement of the spin angular momentum of
a small number of particles can induce a big angular momentum in a much larger
assembly of particles, even at an arbitrary distance. This spin observable can
be macroscopic, assimilable to the pointer of a measurement apparatus, which
illustrates the non-locality of quantum mechanics with particular clarity.

  Beyond the Quantum Regression Theorem</title><description>  Multiple time correlation functions are found in the dynamical description of
different phenomena. They encode and describe the fluctuations of the dynamical
variables of a system. In this paper we formulate a theory of non-Markovian
multiple-time correlation functions (MTCF) for a wide class of systems. We
derive the dynamical equation of the {\it reduced propagator}, an object that
evolve state vectors of the system conditioned to the dynamics of its
environment, which is not necessarily at the vacuum state at the initial time.
Such reduced propagator is the essential piece to obtain multiple-time
correlation functions. An average over the different environmental histories of
the reduced propagator permits us to obtain the evolution equations of the
multiple-time correlation functions. We also study the evolution of MTCF within
the weak coupling limit and it is shown that the multiple-time correlation
function of some observables satisfy the Quantum Regression Theorem (QRT),
whereas other correlations do not. We set the conditions under which the
correlations satisfy the QRT. We illustrate the theory in two different cases;
first, solving an exact model for which the MTCF are explicitly given, and
second, presenting the results of a numerical integration for a system coupled
with a dissipative environment through a non-diagonal interaction.

is expressed in terms of a channel ket, a pure state on a suitable tripartite
system, which functions as a pre-probability allowing the calculation of
statistical correlations between, for example, the entrance and exit of a
channel, once a framework has been chosen so as to allow a consistent set of
probabilities. In each framework the standard notions of ordinary (classical)
information theory apply, and it makes sense to ask whether information of a
particular sort about one system is or is not present in another system.
Quantum effects arise when a single pre-probability is used to compute
statistical correlations in different incompatible frameworks, and various
constraints on the presence and absence of different kinds of information are
expressed in a set of all-or-nothing theorems which generalize or give a
precise meaning to the concept of ``no-cloning.'' These theorems are used to
discuss: the location of information in quantum channels modeled using a
mixed-state environment; the $CQ$ (classical-quantum) channels introduced by
Holevo; and the location of information in the physical carriers of a quantum
code. It is proposed that both channel and entanglement problems be classified
in terms of pure states (functioning as pre-probabilities) on systems of $p\geq
2$ parts, with mixed bipartite entanglement and simple noisy channels belonging
to the category $p=3$, a five-qubit code to the category $p=6$, etc.; then by
the dimensions of the Hilbert spaces of the component parts, along with other
criteria yet to be determined.

find a nonlinear dynamical effect of synchronization between center-of-mass
motion and internal Rabi oscillations. The synchronization manifests itself in
the phase space as limit cycles which may have different periods and riddled
basins of attraction. The effect can be detected in the fluorescence spectra of
atoms as equidistant sideband frequencies with the space between adjacent peaks
to be inversely proportional to the value of the period of the respective limit
cycle. With increasing the intensity of the laser field, we observe numerically
cascades of bifurcations that eventually end up in settling a strange chaotic
attractor. A broadband noise is shown to destroy a fine structure of the
bifurcation scenario, but prominent features of period-1 and period-3 limit
cycles survive under a weak noise. The character of the atomic motion is
analyzed with the help of the friction force whose zeroes are attractor or
repellor points in the velocity space. We find ranges of the laser parameters
where the atomic motion resembles a random but deterministic walking of atoms
erratically jumping between different wells of the optical potential. Such a
random walking is shown to be fractal in the sense that the measured
characteristic of the motion, time of exit of atoms from a given space of the

from standard quantum mechanics has been the subject of a great deal of
interest over the last twenty years. For open quantum systems - those coupled
to a dissipative environment and/or a measurement device - it has been
demonstrated that chaotic-like behaviour can be recovered in the appropriate
classical limit. In this paper, we investigate the entanglement generated
between two nonlinear oscillators, coupled to each other and to their
environment. Entanglement - the inability to factorise coupled quantum systems
into their constituent parts - is one of the defining features of quantum
mechanics. Indeed, it underpins many of the recent developments in quantum
technologies. Here we show that the entanglement characteristics of two
`classical' states (chaotic and periodic solutions) differ significantly in the
classical limit. In particular, we show that significant levels of entanglement
are preserved only in the chaotic-like solutions.

order to take into account the action of the thermal and zero-point random
electromagnetic fields on a charged particle. The result is physically relevant
because we get a non null escape rate over the potential barrier at low

composability) is a powerful tool for allowing the modular design of
cryptographic protocols (composition of protocols) and showing the security of
a given protocol embedded in a larger one. Recently, these methods have
received much attention in the quantum cryptographic community.
  We give a short introduction to simulatable security in general and proceed
by sketching the many different definitional choices together with their

  Based on the reactive simulatability modelling of Backes, Pfitzmann and
Waidner we then develop a quantum security model. By following the BPW
modelling as closely as possible, we show that composable quantum security
definitions for quantum protocols can strongly profit from their classical

independent of the underlying machine model.
  In particular, we give a proof for the simple composition theorem in our

  superradiance in inhomogeneous dielectrics</title><description>  The dynamics of a collection of resonant atoms embedded inside an
inhomogeneous nondispersive and lossless dielectric is described with a dipole
Hamiltonian that is based on a canonical quantization theory. The dielectric is
described macroscopically by a position-dependent dielectric function and the
atoms as microscopic harmonic oscillators. We identify and discuss the role of
several types of Green tensors that describe the spatio-temporal propagation of
field operators. After integrating out the atomic degrees of freedom, a
multiple-scattering formalism emerges in which an exact Lippmann-Schwinger
equation for the electric field operator plays a central role. The equation
describes atoms as point sources and point scatterers for light. First,
single-atom properties are calculated such as position-dependent
spontaneous-emission rates as well as differential cross sections for elastic
scattering and for resonance fluorescence. Secondly, multi-atom processes are
studied. It is shown that the medium modifies both the resonant and the static
parts of the dipole-dipole interactions. These interatomic interactions may
cause the atoms to scatter and emit light cooperatively. Unlike in free space,
differences in position-dependent emission rates and radiative line shifts
influence cooperative decay in the dielectric. As a generic example, it is
shown that near a partially reflecting plane there is a sharp transition from
two-atom superradiance to single-atom emission as the atomic positions are
varied.

process of thermalization, can be addressed in quantum field theory from first
principles. The progress in this field is based on efficient functional
integral techniques, so-called n-particle irreducible effective actions, for
which powerful nonperturbative approximation schemes are available. Here we
give an introduction to these techniques and show how they can be applied in
practice. Though we focus on particle physics and cosmology applications, we
emphasize that these techniques can be equally applied to other nonequilibrium
phenomena in complex many body systems.

  complex Hilbert space: linear and nonlinear evolutions, Schroedinger dynamics</title><description>  We constructed the representation of contextual probabilistic dynamics in the
complex Hilbert space. Thus dynamics of the wave function can be considered as
Hilbert space projections of realistic dynamics in a ``prespace''. The basic
condition for representing of the prespace-dynamics is the law of statistical
conservation of energy -- conservation of probabilities. Construction of the
dynamical representation is an important step in the development of contextual
statistical viewpoint to quantum processes. But the contextual statistical
model is essentially more general than the quantum one. Therefore in general
the Hilbert space projection of the ``prespace'' dynamics can be nonlinear and
even irreversible (but it is always unitary). There were found conditions of
linearity and reversibility of the Hilbert space dynamical projection. We also
found conditions for the conventional Schroedinger dynamics (including
time-dependent Hamiltonians). We remark that in general even the Schroedinger
dynamics is based just on the statistical conservation of energy; for
individual systems the law of conservation of energy can be violated (at least
in our theoretical model).

multi-partite Hamiltonian. This is known to be an important primitive in
quantum information processing and several schemes have been presented in the
literature to achieve this task. A method to construct decoupling schemes for
quantum systems of pairwise interacting qubits was introduced by M.
Stollsteimer and G. Mahler and is based on orthogonal arrays. Another approach
based on triples of Hadamard matrices that are closed under pointwise
multiplication was proposed by D. Leung. In this paper, we show that both
methods lead to the same class of decoupling schemes. Moreover, we establish a
characterization of orthogonal arrays by showing that they are equivalent to
decoupling schemes which allow a refinement into equidistant time-slots.
Furthermore, we show that decoupling schemes for networks of higher-dimensional
quantum systems with t-local Hamiltonians can be constructed from classical
error-correcting codes.

in which the Hamiltonian operator components carry explicit time dependence
which is not under the control of an external agent. We consider the general
situation in which the state moves in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, a
drift term is present, and the operators driving the state evolution may be
unbounded. However, considerations are restricted by the assumption that there
exists an analytic domain, dense in the state space, on which solutions of the
controlled Schrodinger equation may be expressed globally in exponential form.
The issue of controllability then naturally focuses on the ability to steer the
quantum state on a finite-dimensional submanifold of the unit sphere in Hilbert
space -- and thus on analytic controllability. A relatively straightforward
strategy allows the extension of Lie-algebraic conditions for strong analytic
controllability derived earlier for the simpler, time-independent system in
which the drift Hamiltonian and the interaction Hamiltonia have no intrinsic
time dependence. Enlarging the state space by one dimension corresponding to
the time variable, we construct an augmented control system that can be treated
as time-independent. Methods developed by Kunita can then be implemented to
establish controllability conditions for the one-dimension-reduced system
defined by the original time-dependent Schrodinger control problem. The
applicability of the resulting theorem is illustrated with selected examples.

  discrete space-time</title><description>  In this paper we show that the existence of a primarily discrete space-time
may be a fruitful assumption from which we may develop a new approach of
statistical thermodynamics in pre-relativistic conditions. The discreetness of
space-time structure is determined by a condition that mimics the Heisenberg
uncertainty relations and the motion in this space-time model is chosen as
simple as possible. From these two assumptions we define a path-entropy that
measures the number of closed paths associated with a given energy of the
system preparation. This entropy has a dynamical character and depends on the
time interval on which we count the paths. We show that it exists an
like-equilibrium condition for which the path-entropy corresponds exactly to
the usual thermodynamic entropy and, more generally, the usual statistical
thermodynamics is reobtained. This result derived without using the Gibbs
ensemble method shows that the standard thermodynamics is consistent with a
motion that is time-irreversible at a microscopic level. From this change of
paradigm it becomes easy to derive a $H-theorem$. A comparison with the
traditional Boltzmann approach is presented. We also show how our approach can
be implemented in order to describe reversible processes. By considering a
process defined simultaneously by initial and final conditions a well defined
stochastic process is introduced and we are able to derive a Schroedinger
equation, an example of time reversible equation.

generality for linear optical networks followed by postselection, i.e., for
networks of arbitrary size, any number of auxiliary modes, and arbitrary photon
numbers. As a corollary, the previously formulated conjecture is proven that
the optimal success probability of a postselected non-linear sign shift without
feed-forward is 1/4, a gate playing the central role in the scheme of
Knill-Laflamme-Milburn for quantum computation with linear optics. The concept
of Lagrange duality is shown to be applicable to provide rigorous proofs for
such bounds for elementary gates, although the original problem is a difficult
non-convex problem in infinitely many objective variables. The versatility of
this approach to identify other optimal linear optical schemes is demonstrated.

quantised electromagnetic field. All material parameters and interaction
strengths are allowed to depend on position. The ensuing Hamiltonian is
expressed in terms of canonical fields, and diagonalised by performing a
normal-mode expansion. The commutation relations of the diagonalising operators
are in agreement with the canonical commutation relations. For the proof we
replace all sums of normal modes by complex integrals with the help of the
residue theorem. The same technique helps us to explicitly calculate the
quantum evolution of all canonical and electromagnetic fields. We identify the
dielectric constant and the Green function of the wave equation for the
electric field. Both functions are meromorphic in the complex frequency plane.
The solution of the extended Ullersma model is in keeping with well-known
phenomenological rules for setting up quantum electrodynamics in an absorptive
and spatially inhomogeneous dielectric. To establish this fundamental
justification, we subject the reservoir of independent harmonic oscillators to
a continuum limit. The resonant frequencies of the reservoir are smeared out
over the real axis. Consequently, the poles of both the dielectric constant and
the Green function unite to form a branch cut. Performing an analytic
continuation beyond this branch cut, we find that the long-time behaviour of
the quantised electric field is completely determined by the sources of the
reservoir. Through a Riemann-Lebesgue argument we demonstrate that the field
itself tends to zero, whereas its quantum fluctuations stay alive. We argue
that the last feature may have important consequences for application of
entanglement and related processes in quantum devices.

is largely because of the emergence of quantum mechanics with wave-particle
duality. Instead of Lorentz-boosting rigid bodies, we now boost waves and have
to deal with Lorentz transformations of waves. We now have some understanding
of plane waves or running waves in the covariant picture, but we do not yet
have a clear picture of standing waves. In this report, we show that there is
one set of standing waves which can be Lorentz-transformed while being
consistent with all physical principle of quantum mechanics and relativity. It
is possible to construct a representation of the Poincar\'e group using
harmonic oscillator wave functions satisfying space-time boundary conditions.
This set of wave functions is capable of explaining the quantum bound state for
both slow and fast hadrons. In particular it can explain the quark model for
hadrons at rest, and Feynman's parton model hadrons moving with a speed close
to that of light.

  magnetic resonance</title><description>  The role of mixed state entanglement in liquid-state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) quantum computation is not yet well-understood. In particular,
despite the success of quantum information processing with NMR, recent work has
shown that quantum states used in most of those experiments were not entangled.
This is because these states, derived by unitary transforms from the thermal
equilibrium state, were too close to the maximally mixed state. We are thus
motivated to determine whether a given NMR state is entanglable - that is, does
there exist a unitary transform that entangles the state? The boundary between
entanglable and nonentanglable thermal states is a function of the spin system
size $N$ and its temperature $T$. We provide new bounds on the location of this
boundary using analytical and numerical methods; our tightest bound scales as
$N \sim T$, giving a lower bound requiring at least $N \sim 22,000$ proton
spins to realize an entanglable thermal state at typical laboratory NMR
magnetic fields. These bounds are tighter than known bounds on the
entanglability of effective pure states.

velocity dispersion in a periodic structure. Since the phase-matching relies on

We show that they incorporate the current important quantum algorithms.
Furthermore, the importance of the unitarity constraint given by quantum

pure entangled state which is incomparable with the given input state, by
collective LOCC with certainty. The first one is by providing some pure
entanglement through the lower dimensional maximally-entangled states or using
further less amount of entanglement and the next one is by collective operation
on two pairs which are individually incomparable. It is quite surprising that
we are able to achieve maximally entangled states of any Schmidt rank from a

  Architecture for Solid-State Quantum Information Processing</title><description>  We describe the design for a scalable, solid-state
quantum-information-processing architecture based on the integration of
GHz-frequency nanomechanical resonators with Josephson tunnel junctions, which
has the potential for demonstrating a variety of single- and multi-qubit
operations critical to quantum computation. The computational qubits are
eigenstates of large-area, current-biased Josephson junctions, manipulated and
measured using strobed external circuitry. Two or more of these phase qubits
are capacitively coupled to a high-quality-factor piezoelectric
nanoelectromechanical disk resonator, which forms the backbone of our
architecture, and which enables coherent coupling of the qubits. The integrated
system is analogous to one or more few-level atoms (the Josephson junction
qubits) in an electromagnetic cavity (the nanomechanical resonator). However,
unlike existing approaches using atoms in electromagnetic cavities, here we can
individually tune the level spacing of the ``atoms'' and control their
``electromagnetic'' interaction strength. We show theoretically that quantum
states prepared in a Josephson junction can be passed to the nanomechanical
resonator and stored there, and then can be passed back to the original
junction or transferred to another with high fidelity. The resonator can also
be used to produce maximally entangled Bell states between a pair of Josephson
junctions. Many such junction-resonator complexes can assembled in a
hub-and-spoke layout, resulting in a large-scale quantum circuit. Our proposed
architecture combines desirable features of both solid-state and cavity quantum
electrodynamics approaches, and could make quantum information processing
possible in a scalable, solid-state environment.

requirement that the entries of a matrix representative of the map are
non-negative (EP). In particular, for integer t, multiplicativity holds for the
maximal 2 -&gt; 2t norm of a product of two maps, whenever one of the pair is EP;
for the maximal 1 -&gt; t norm for pairs of CP maps when one of them is also EP;

established. Scaling to higher number of qubits is hindered by two major
requirements (i) mutual coupling among qubits and (ii) qubit addressability. It
has been demonstrated that mutual coupling can be increased by using residual
dipolar couplings among spins by orienting the spin system in a liquid
crystalline matrix. In such a case, the heteronuclear spins are weakly coupled
but the homonuclear spins become strongly coupled. In such circumstances, the
strongly coupled spins can no longer be treated as qubits. However, it has been
demonstrated elsewhere, that the $2^N$ energy levels of a strongly coupled N
spin-1/2 system can be treated as an N-qubit system. For this purpose the
various transitions have to be identified to well defined energy levels. This
paper consists of two parts. In the first part, the energy level diagram of a
heteronuclear 5-spin system is obtained by using a newly developed
heteronuclear z-cosy (HET-Z-COSY) experiment. In the second part,
implementation of logic gates, preparation of pseudopure states, creation of

that interference is real and input components undergo energy redistribution.
Both interpretations entail the same observable consequences at the macroscopic
level, but the first approach is considerably more popular. This preference was
established before the emergence of quantum mechanics. Unfortunately, it
requires a non-classical underlying mechanism and fails to explain well-known

present a quantum protocol for sending and receiving classical bits
anonymously, which is completely traceless: it successfully prevents later
reconstruction of the sender. We show that this is not possible classically. It
appears that entangled quantum states are uniquely suited for traceless
anonymous transmissions. We then extend this protocol to send and receive

by its influence on an ensemble of trapped spin polarized atoms. The atoms
interact off-resonantly with a continuous laser field, and the measurement of
the polarization rotation of the probe light, induced by the dispersive
atom-light coupling, leads to spin-squeezing of the atomic sample which enables
an estimate of the magnetic field which is more precise than that expected from
standard counting statistics. For polarized light and polarized atoms, a
description of the non-classical components of the collective spin angular
momentum for the atoms and the collective Stokes vectors of the light-field in
terms of effective gaussian position and momentum variables is practically
exact. The gaussian formalism describes the dynamics of the system very
effectively and accounts explicitly for the back-action on the atoms due to
measurement and for the estimate of the magnetic field. Multi-component
magnetic fields are estimated by the measurement of suitably chosen atomic
observables and precision and efficiency is gained by dividing the atomic gas
in two or more samples which are entangled by the dispersive atom-light
interaction.

horizon of an evaporating black hole, while the other half remains coherently
accessible to experiments in the exterior region. Beyond complete evaporation,
the evolution of the quantum state past the Cauchy horizon cannot remain
unitary, raising the questions: How can this evolution be described as a
quantum map, and how is causality preserved? What are the possible effects of
such nonstandard quantum evolution maps on the behavior of the entangled
laboratory partner? More generally, the laws of quantum evolution under extreme
conditions in remote regions (not just in evaporating black-hole interiors, but
possibly near other naked singularities and regions of extreme spacetime
structure) remain untested by observation, and might conceivably be non-unitary
or even nonlinear, raising the same questions about the evolution of entangled
states. The answers to these questions are subtle, and are linked in unexpected
ways to the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. We show that terrestrial
experiments can be designed to probe and constrain exactly how the laws of
quantum evolution might be altered, either by black-hole evaporation, or by
other extreme processes in remote regions possibly governed by unknown physics.

  Complex Contour</title><description>  We describe a method that allows for a practical application of the theory of
pseudo-Hermitian operators to PT-symmetric systems defined on a complex
contour. We apply this method to study the Hamiltonians $H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\nu$
with $\nu\in(-2,\infty)$ that are defined along the corresponding anti-Stokes
lines. In particular, we reveal the intrinsic non-Hermiticity of $H$ for the
cases that $\nu$ is an even integer, so that $H=p^2\pm x^{2+\nu}$, and give a
proof of the discreteness of the spectrum of $H$ for all $\nu\in(-2,\infty)$.
Furthermore, we study the consequences of defining a square-well Hamiltonian on
a wedge-shaped complex contour. This yields a PT-symmetric system with a finite
number of real eigenvalues. We present a comprehensive analysis of this system
within the framework of pseudo-Hermitian quantum mechanics. We also outline a
direct pseudo-Hermitian treatment of PT-symmetric systems defined on a complex
contour which clarifies the underlying mathematical structure of the
formulation of PT-symmetric quantum mechanics based on the charge-conjugation
operator. Our results provide a conclusive evidence that pseudo-Hermitian
quantum mechanics provides a complete description of general PT-symmetric
systems regardless of whether they are defined along the real line or a complex
contour.

  Significant Boolean Functions</title><description>  Boolean functions are important building blocks in cryptography for their
wide application in both stream and block cipher systems. For cryptanalysis of
such systems one tries to find out linear functions that are correlated to the
Boolean functions used in the crypto system. Let $f$ be an $n$-variable Boolean
function and its Walsh spectra is denoted by $W_f(\omega)$ at the point $\omega
\in \{0, 1\}^n$. The Boolean function is available in the form of an oracle. We
like to find an $\omega$ such that $W_f(\omega) \neq 0$ as this will provide
one of the linear functions which are correlated to $f$. We show that the
quantum algorithm proposed by Deutsch and Jozsa (1992) solves the above
mentioned problem in constant time. However, the best known classical algorithm
to solve this problem requires exponential time in $n$. We also analyse certain
classes of cryptographically significant Boolean functions and highlight how
the basic Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm performs on them.

for quantum computation. We analytically estimate how the threshold will depend
on a scale parameter r which estimates the scale-up in the size of the circuit
due to encoding. We carry out a detailed semi-numerical threshold analysis for
concatenated coding using the 7-qubit CSS code in the local and `nonlocal'
setting. First, we find that the threshold in the local model for the [[7,1,3]]
code has a 1/r dependence, which is in correspondence with our analytical
estimate. Second, the threshold, beyond the 1/r dependence, does not depend too
strongly on the noise levels for transporting qubits. Beyond these results, we
find that it is important to look at more than one level of concatenation in
order to estimate the threshold and that it may be beneficial in certain
places, like in the transportation of qubits, to do error correction only
infrequently.

  sharing in Gaussian states of continuous variable systems</title><description>  For continuous-variable systems, we introduce a measure of entanglement, the
continuous variable tangle ({\em contangle}), with the purpose of quantifying
the distributed (shared) entanglement in multimode, multipartite Gaussian
states. This is achieved by a proper convex roof extension of the squared
logarithmic negativity. We prove that the contangle satisfies the
Coffman-Kundu-Wootters monogamy inequality in all three--mode Gaussian states,
and in all fully symmetric $N$--mode Gaussian states, for arbitrary $N$. For
three--mode pure states we prove that the residual entanglement is a genuine
tripartite entanglement monotone under Gaussian local operations and classical
communication. We show that pure, symmetric three--mode Gaussian states allow a
promiscuous entanglement sharing, having both maximum tripartite residual
entanglement and maximum couplewise entanglement between any pair of modes.
These states are thus simultaneous continuous-variable analogs of both the GHZ
and the $W$ states of three qubits: in continuous-variable systems monogamy
does not prevent promiscuity, and the inequivalence between different classes
of maximally entangled states, holding for systems of three or more qubits, is
removed.

is maximized by a Gaussian cloner, whereas the single-clone fidelity can be
enhanced by non-Gaussian operations: a symmetric non-Gaussian 1-to-2 cloner can
achieve a single-clone fidelity of approximately 0.6826, perceivably higher
than the optimal fidelity of 2/3 in a Gaussian setting. This optimal cloner can
be realized by means of an optical parametric amplifier supplemented with a
particular source of non-Gaussian bimodal states. Finally, we show that the

formulated based on the notion of time and space, both of which are thought a
priori given quantities or notions. However, when we try to define the notion
of velocity or momentum, we encounter a difficulty as we will see in chapter 1.
The problem is that if the notion of time is given a priori, the velocity is
definitely determined when given a position, which contradicts the uncertainty
principle of Heisenberg. We then set the basis of QM on the notion of position
and momentum operators as in chapter 2. Time of a local system then is defined
approximately as a ratio $|x|/|v|$ between the space coordinate $x$ and the
velocity $v$. In this formulation of QM, we can keep the uncertainty principle,
and time is a quantity that does not have precise values unlike the usually
supposed notion of time has. The feature of local time is that it is a time
proper to each local system, which is defined as a finite set of quantum
mechanical particles. We now have an infinite number of local times that are
unique and proper to each local system. Based on the notion of local time, the
motion inside a local system is described by the usual Schr\&quot;odinger equation.
We investigate such motion in a given local system in part II. This is a usual
quantum mechanics. After some excursion of the investigation of local motion,
we consider in part III the relative relation or motion between plural local
systems. In the final part IV, we will prove that there is at least one
Universe wave function $\phi$ in which all local systems have local motions and
thus local times. This concludes our formulation of Quantum Mechanics.

  dot-like single quantum well excitons</title><description>  A scheme of three-particle entanglement purification is presented in this
work. The physical system undertaken for investigation is dot-like single
quantum well excitons independently coupled through a single microcavity mode.
The theoretical framework for the proposed scheme is based on the quantum jump
approach for analyzing the progress of the trible-exciton entanglement as a
series of conditional measurement has been taken on the cavity field state. We
first investigate how cavity photon affects the purity of the double-exciton
state and the purification efficiency in two-particle protocol. Then we extend
the two-particle case and conclude that the three-exciton state can be purified
into W state, which involves the one-photon-trapping phenomenon, with a high
yield. Finally, an achievable setup for purification using only modest and
presently feasible technologies is also proposed.

the information-theoretic approach. We argue that this approach belongs to the
epistemological framework depicted as a loop of existences. In Part II we
derive the quantum formalism from information-theoretic axioms and we analyze
the twofold role of observer as physical system and as informational agent.
Quantum logical techniques are then introduced, and we prove theorems
reconstructing elements of the formalism. In Part III, we introduce the
formalism of C*-algebras and give it an information theoretic interpretation.
We analyze the conceptual underpinnings of the theory of modular automorphisms
and we give an information-theoretic justification for the emergence of time in
the algebraic approach. We conclude by giving a list of open questions,
including topics in cognitive science, decision theory, and information
technology.

an intrinsically quantum object. As a consequence, complete information about
the pulse cannot, even in principle, be perfectly recorded in a classical
memory. In the field of quantum information this has led to a long standing
challenge: how to achieve a high-fidelity transfer of an independently prepared
quantum state of light onto the atomic quantum state? Here we propose and
experimentally demonstrate a protocol for such quantum memory based on atomic
ensembles. We demonstrate for the first time a recording of an externally
provided quantum state of light onto the atomic quantum memory with a fidelity
up to 70%, significantly higher than that for the classical recording. Quantum
storage of light is achieved in three steps: an interaction of light with
atoms, the subsequent measurement on the transmitted light, and the feedback
onto the atoms conditioned on the measurement result. Density of recorded
states 33% higher than that for the best classical recording of light on atoms
is achieved. A quantum memory lifetime of up to 4 msec is demonstrated.

multi-photon pluses transmitted from Alice to Bob, given whatever type of Eve's

pseudo-random operators can overcome the exponential cost of random operators
required for quantum communication tasks such as super-dense coding of quantum

  formalism and phenomena</title><description>  In spite of many results in quantum information theory, the complex nature of
compound systems is far from being clear. In general the information is a
mixture of local, and non-local (&quot;quantum&quot;) information. To make this point
more clear, we develop and investigate the quantum information processing
paradigm in which parties sharing a multipartite state distill local
information. The amount of information which is lost because the parties must
use a classical communication channel is the deficit. This scheme can be viewed
as complementary to the notion of distilling entanglement. After reviewing the
paradigm, we show that the upper bound for the deficit is given by the relative
entropy distance to so-called psuedo-classically correlated states; the lower
bound is the relative entropy of entanglement. This implies, in particular,
that any entangled state is informationally nonlocal i.e. has nonzero deficit.
We also apply the paradigm to defining the thermodynamical cost of erasing
entanglement. We show the cost is bounded from below by relative entropy of
entanglement. We demonstrate the existence of several other non-local
phenomena. For example,we prove the existence of a form of non-locality without
entanglement and with distinguishability. We analyze the deficit for several
classes of multipartite pure states and obtain that in contrast to the GHZ
state, the Aharonov state is extremely nonlocal (and in fact can be thought of
as quasi-nonlocalisable). We also show that there do not exist states, for
which the deficit is strictly equal to the whole informational content (bound
local information). We then discuss complementary features of information in
distributed quantum systems. Finally we discuss the physical and theoretical
meaning of the results and pose many open questions.

for a universal representation of the quantum structure on which quantum
information stands. The dynamical evolution process associated with generic
quantum information manipulation is based on the (re)coupling theory of SU(2)
angular momenta. Such scheme automatically incorporates all the essential
features that make quantum information encoding much more efficient than
classical: it is fully discrete; it deals with inherently entangled states,
naturally endowed with a tensor product structure; it allows for generic
encoding patterns. The model proposed can be thought of as the non-Boolean
generalization of the quantum circuit model, with unitary gates expressed in
terms of 3nj coefficients connecting inequivalent binary coupling schemes of
n+1 angular momentum variables, as well as Wigner rotations in the eigenspace
of the total angular momentum. A crucial role is played by elementary j-gates
(6j symbols) which satisfy algebraic identities that make the structure of the
model similar to &quot;state sum models&quot;, employed in discretizing Topological
Quantum Field Theories and quantum gravity. The spin network simulator can thus
be viewed also as a Combinatorial QFT model for computation. The semiclassical
limit (large j's) is discussed.

We carefully designed our experiment so that the resource requirement would

  orthogonal arrays</title><description>  The task of decoupling, i.e., removing unwanted interactions in a system
Hamiltonian and/or couplings with an environment (decoherence), plays an
important role in controlling quantum systems. There are many efficient
decoupling schemes based on combinatorial concepts like orthogonal arrays,
difference schemes and Hadamard matrices. So far these (combinatorial)
decoupling schemes have relied on the ability to effect sequences of
instantaneous, arbitrarily strong control Hamiltonians (bang-bang controls). To
overcome the shortcomings of bang-bang control Viola and Knill proposed a
method called Eulerian decoupling that allows the use of bounded-strength
controls for decoupling. However, their method was not directly designed to
take advantage of the composite structure of multipartite quantum systems. In
this paper we define a combinatorial structure called an Eulerian orthogonal
array. It merges the desirable properties of orthogonal arrays and Eulerian
cycles in Cayley graphs (that are the basis of Eulerian decoupling). We show
that this structure gives rise to decoupling schemes with bounded-strength
control Hamiltonians that can be applied to composite quantum systems with few
body Hamiltonians and special couplings with the environment. Furthermore, we
show how to construct Eulerian orthogonal arrays having good parameters in
order to obtain efficient decoupling schemes.

thermodynamics of black holes and other horizons. Our discussion centers on
various ``entropy bounds'' which have been proposed in the literature and on
the current understanding of how such bounds are {\it not} required for the
semi-classical consistency of black hole thermodynamics. Instead, consistency
under certain extreme circumstances is provided by two effects. The first is
simply the exponential enhancement of the rate at which a macrostate with large
entropy is emitted in any thermal process. The second is a new sense in which
the entropy of an ``object'' depends on the observer making the measurement, so
that observers crossing the horizon measure a different entropy flux across the
horizon than do observers remaining outside. In addition to the review, some
recent criticisms are addressed. In particular, additional arguments and
detailed numerical calculations showing the observer dependence of entropy are
presented in a simple model. This observer-dependence may have further
interesting implications for the thermodynamics of black holes.

  edge</title><description>  We propose a method for controlling the decoherence of a driven qubit that is
strongly coupled to a reservoir, when the qubit resonance frequency is close to
a continuum edge of the reservoir spectum. This strong-coupling regime is
outside the scope of existing methods of decoherence control. We demonstate
that an appropriate sequence of nearly abrupt changes of the resonance
frequency can protect the qubit state from decay and decoherence more
effectively than the intuitively obvious alternative, which is to fix the
resonance well within a forbidden bandgap of the reservoir spectrum, as far as
possible from the continuum edge. The &quot;counterintuitive&quot; nonadiabatic method
outlined here can outperform its adiabatic counterparts in maintaining a high
fidelity of quantum logic operations. The remarkable effectiveness of the
proposed method, which requires much lower rates of frequency changes than
previously proposed control methods, is due to the ability of appropriately
alternating detunings from the continuum edge to augment the interference of
the emitted and back-scattered quanta, thereby helping to stabilize the qubit
state against decay. Applications to the control of decoherence near the edge
of radiative, vibrational an photoionization continua are discussed.

|0&gt;,...,|d-1&gt;. Quantum computation has stimulated much recent interest in
algorithms factoring unitary evolutions of an n-qubit state space into
component two-particle unitary evolutions. In the absence of symmetry, Shende,
Markov and Bullock use Sard's theorem to prove that at least C 4^n two-qubit
unitary evolutions are required, while Vartiainen, Moettoenen, and Salomaa
(VMS) use the QR matrix factorization and Gray codes in an optimal order
construction involving two-particle evolutions. In this work, we note that
Sard's theorem demands C d^{2n} two-qudit unitary evolutions to construct a
generic (symmetry-less) n-qudit evolution. However, the VMS result applied to
virtual-qubits only recovers optimal order in the case that d is a power of
two. We further construct a QR decomposition for d-multi-level quantum logics,
proving a sharp asymptotic of Theta(d^{2n}) two-qudit gates and thus closing
the complexity question for all d-level systems (d finite.) Gray codes are not
required, and the optimal Theta(d^{2n}) asymptotic also applies to gate
libraries where two-qudit interactions are restricted by a choice of certain

  irreversibility and decoherence</title><description>  The Loschmidt echo (LE) is a measure of the sensitivity of quantum mechanics
to perturbations in the evolution operator. It is defined as the overlap of two
wave functions evolved from the same initial state but with slightly different
Hamiltonians. Thus, it also serves as a quantification of irreversibility in
quantum mechanics.
  In this thesis the LE is studied in systems that have a classical counterpart
with dynamical instability, that is, classically chaotic. An analytical
treatment that makes use of the semiclassical approximation is presented. It is
shown that, under certain regime of the parameters, the LE decays
exponentially. Furthermore, for strong enough perturbations, the decay rate is
given by the Lyapunov exponent of the classical system. Some particularly
interesting examples are given.
  The analytical results are supported by thorough numerical studies. In
addition, some regimes not accessible to the theory are explored, showing that
the LE and its Lyapunov regime present the same form of universality ascribed
to classical chaos. In a sense, this is evidence that the LE is a robust
temporal signature of chaos in the quantum realm.
  Finally, the relation between the LE and the quantum to classical transition
is explored, in particular with the theory of decoherence. Using two different
approaches, a semiclassical approximation to Wigner functions and a master
equation for the LE, it is shown that the decoherence rate and the decay rate
of the LE are equal. The relationship between these quantities results mutually
beneficial, in terms of the broader resources of decoherence theory and of the
possible experimental realization of the LE.

this paper. By discovering the symmetrical Lie group of various atomic systems,
such as single-atomic-ensemble composed of complex $m$-level $(m&gt;3)$ atoms, and
$two$-atomic-ensemble and even multi-atomic-ensemble system composed of of
$three$-level atoms etc., one can obtain the general definition of dark-state
polaritons (DSPs), and then the dark-states of these different systems. The
symmetrical properties of the multi-level system and multi-atomic-ensemble
system are shown to be dependent on some characteristic parameters of the EIT
system. Furthermore, a controllable scheme to generate quantum entanglement
between lights or atoms via quantized DSPs theory is discussed and the
robustness of this scheme is analyzed by confirming the validity of adiabatic
passage conditions in this paper.

interactions between atoms and off-resonant light which are known as
paramagnetic Faraday rotation and fictitious magnetic field of light. Since the
projection process, squeezed light, or special interactions among the atoms are
not required in this method, it can be widely applied to many systems. The
attainable range of the squeezing parameter is S^{-2/5}, where S is the total
spin, which is limited by additional fluctuations imposed by coherent light and
the spherical nature of the spin distribution.

Dolinar scheme that achieves the minimum error discrimination of binary
coherent states. Moreover, we show that the Dolinar-type approach can also be

setting by Plaskota et al. (J. Comp. Phys. 164 (2000) 335) for the univariate
case and by Kwas and Li (J. Comp. 19 (2003) 730) for the multivariate case with
d space variables. In this paper we consider the multivariate Feynman-Kac path
integration problem in the randomized and quantum settings. For smooth
multivariate functions, it was proven in Kwas and Li (2003) that the classical
worst case complexity suffers from the curse of dimensionality in d. We show
that in both the randomized and quantum settings the curse of dimensionality is
vanquished, i.e., the number of function evaluations and/or quantum queries
required to compute an e-approximation has a bound independent of d and
depending polynomially on 1/e. The exponents of these polynomials are at most 2
in the randomized setting and at most 1 in the quantum setting. Hence we have
exponential speedup over the classical worst case setting and quadratic speedup
of the quantum setting over the randomized setting. However, both the
randomized and quantum algorithms presented here still require extensive
precomputing, similar to the algorithms of Plaskota et al. (2000) and Kwas and
Li(2003).

  systems</title><description>  We develop a comprehensive theory of phase for finite-dimensional quantum
systems. The only physical requirement we impose is that phase is complementary
to amplitude. To implement this complementarity we use the notion of mutually
unbiased bases, which exist for dimensions that are powers of a prime. For a
d-dimensional system (qudit) we explicitly construct d+1 classes of maximally
commuting operators, each one consisting of d-1 operators. One of this class
consists of diagonal operators that represent amplitudes (or inversions). By
the finite Fourier transform, it is mapped onto ladder operators that can be
appropriately interpreted as phase variables. We discuss the examples of qubits
and qutrits, and show how these results generalize previous approaches.

by quantum fluctuations on two parallel birefringent plates with in plane
optical anisotropy, separated by either vacuum or a liquid (ethanol). The
torque is found to vary as $\sin(2\theta)$, where $\theta$ represents the angle
between the two optical axes, and its magnitude rapidly increases with
decreasing plate separation $d$. For a 40 $\mu$m diameter disk, made out of
either quartz or calcite, kept parallel to a Barium Titanate plate at $d\simeq
100$ nm, the maximum torque (at $\theta={\pi\over 4}$) is of the order of
$\simeq 10^{-19}$ N$\cdot$m. We propose an experiment to observe this torque
when the Barium Titanate plate is immersed in ethanol and the other
birefringent disk is placed on top of it. In this case the retarded van der
Waals (or Casimir-Lifshitz) force between the two birefringent slabs is
repulsive. The disk would float parallel to the plate at a distance where its
net weight is counterbalanced by the retarded van der Waals repulsion, free to
rotate in response to very small driving torques.

  coherences</title><description>  This letter presents a two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR)
approach for constructing a two-logical-qubit decoherence-free subspace (DFS)
based on the fact that the three protons in a CH3 spin system can not be
resolved in one-dimension NMR spectroscopy, but to a certain extent, can be
distinguished by two-dimensional multiple-quantum NMR. We used four noisy
physical nuclear spins, including three protons and one carbon in the CH3 spin
system, to generate two decoherence-free logical quantum bits. It made full use
of the unaddressed spins which could not be used in one-dimensional spectrum.
Furthermore, we have experimentally demonstrated such an approach. Our
experimental results have shown that our DFS can protect against far more types
of decoherence than the one composed of four noisy physical qubits all with
different chemical shifts. More importantly, this idea may provide new insights
into extending qubit systems in the sense that it effectively utilizes the
magnetically equivalent nuclei.

  energetic particles</title><description>  We consider tunneling transitions between states separated by an energy
barrier in a simple field theoretical model. We analyse the case of soliton
creation induced by collisions of a few highly energetic particles. We present
semiclassical, but otherwise first principle, study of this process at all
energies of colliding particles. We find that direct tunneling to the final
state occurs at energies below the critical value E_c, which is slightly higher
than the barrier height. Tunneling probability grows with energy in this
regime. Above the critical energy, the tunneling mechanism is different. The
transition proceeds through creation of a state close to the top of the
potential barrier (sphaleron) and its subsequent decay. At certain limiting
energy E_l tunneling probability ceases to grow. At higher energies the
dominant mechanism of transition becomes the release of energy excess E-E_l by
the emission of a few particles and then tunneling at effectively lower energy
E=E_l via the limiting semiclassical configuration. The latter belongs to a
class of ``real--time instantons'', semiclassical solutions saturating the
inclusive probability of tunneling from initial states with given number of
particles. We conclude that the process of collision--induced tunneling is
exponentially suppressed at all energies.

advantages as computational manageable measures of entanglement, and show that
for pure bipartite states all measures of entanglement can be written as
functions of the concurrence monotones. We then show that the concurrence
monotones provide bounds on quantum information tasks. As an example, we
discuss their applications to remote entanglement distributions (RED) such as
entanglement swapping and remote preparation of bipartite entangled states
(RPBES). We prove a powerful theorem which states what kind of (possibly mixed)
bipartite states or distributions of bipartite states can not be remotely
prepared. The theorem establishes an upper bound on the amount of
$G$-concurrence (one member in the concurrence family) that can be created
between two single-qudit nodes of quantum networks by means of tripartite RED.
For pure bipartite states the bound on the $G$-concurrence can always be
saturated by RPBES.

tighten the connection by replacing the real and complex number basis of
physical theories by sets R_{n},C_{n} of length 2n finite binary string
numbers. The form of the numbers in R_{n} is based on the infinite hierarchy of
2n figure outputs from measurements of any physical quantity with an infinite
range (distance, energy, etc.). A space and time based on these numbers is
described. It corresponds to an infinite sequence of spherical scale sections
R_{n,e} (e an integer). Each section has the same number of points but the size
increases exponentially with increasing e. The sections converge towards an
origin which is a space singularity. Iteration of an order preserving
transformation, F_{&lt;} or its inverse shows exponential expansion or contraction
of the space with the origin as a source or sink of space points. The
suitability of R_{n} space as a framework for inflationary cosmology is based
on a constant iteration rate for F_{&lt;} and time dependent e and n=n(t). At t=0
all space is restricted to a region of scale sections R_{n_{0},e} with n_{0}
(small) and e\leq e_{0} (negative). Inflation, which occurs naturally, is
stopped automatically at time t_{I} by increasing n from n_{0} to n_{I}&gt;&gt;n_{0}.
Here n_{I} is such that the outermost \Delta scale sections of R_{n_{0}} space,
which are moving at velocities &gt;c at time t_{I}, are contained in the scale
section R_{n_{I},0} of R_{n_{I}} space. This is needed if R_{n_{I},0} space is
to be similar to the usual R space. Hubble expansion and the redshift are
accounted for by a continuing slow increase in n. Comparison with experimental
data suggests that the rate of increase must be at least one n unit every 30-60
million years.

splitter in the Bell measurement. It is shown that in the non-unity gain regime
the signal transfer coefficient can be enhanced while the conditional variance
product remains preserved by applying appropriate local squeezing operation on
sender's part of the shared entangled state. In the unity gain regime it is
demonstrated that the fidelity of teleportation can be increased with the help
of the local squeezing operations on parts of the shared entangled state that
convert effectively our scheme to the standard CV teleportation scheme.
Further, it is proved analytically that such a choice of the local symplectic
operations minimizes the noise by which the mean number of photons in the input
state is increased during the teleportation. Finally, our analysis reveals that
the local symplectic operation on sender's side can be integrated into the Bell
measurement if the interaction constant of the interaction in the Bell

computational problems. In practice, quantum computers must operate with noisy
devices called ``gates'' that tend to destroy the fragile quantum states needed
for computation. The goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing is to compute
accurately even when gates have a high probability of error each time they are
used. Here we give evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible with
error probabilities above 3% per gate, which is significantly higher than what

at such high error probabilities are excessive. Fortunately, they decrease
rapidly with decreasing error probabilities. If we had quantum resources
comparable to the considerable resources available in today's digital

  quantum correlation functions</title><description>  Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, various classical systems
differing only on the scale smaller than Planck's cell correspond to the same
quantum system. This fact is used to find a unique semiclassical representation
without the Van Vleck determinant, applicable to a large class of correlation
functions expressible as quantum fidelity. As in the Feynman path integral
formulation of quantum mechanics, all contributing trajectories have the same
amplitude: that is why it is denoted the ``dephasing representation.'' By
relating the present approach to the problem of existence of true trajectories
near numerically-computed chaotic trajectories, the approximation is made
rigorous for any system in which the shadowing theorem holds. Numerical
implementation only requires computing actions along the unperturbed
trajectories and not finding the shadowing trajectories. While semiclassical
linear-response theory was used before in quasi-integrable and chaotic systems,
here its validity is justified in the most generic, mixed systems. Dephasing
representation appears to be a rare practical method to calculate quantum
correlation functions in nonuniversal regimes in many-dimensional systems where
exact quantum calculations are impossible.

of the coupling between the qubits. We show that in the case of phase covariant
cloner the XY coupling gives the best results. In the 1-&gt;2 cloning we find that
the value for the fidelity of the optimal cloner is achieved, and values
comparable to the optimal ones in the general N-&gt;M case can be attained. If a
suitable set of network symmetries are satisfied, the output fidelity of the
clones does not depend on the specific choice of the graph. We show that spin
network cloning is robust against the presence of static imperfections.
Moreover, in the presence of noise, it outperforms the conventional approach.
In this case the fidelity exceeds the corresponding value obtained by quantum

recoiled atoms in the same state as the atoms in the condensate. Here the
recoiling atoms are able to interfere with the condensate at rest to form a
matter-wave grating (interference fringes) which is observed experimentally.

the case N=4 (quant-ph/0308037), we undertake the task for N=6 of computing to
high numerical accuracy, the formulas of Sommers and Zyczkowski
(quant-ph/0304041) for the (N^2-1)-dimensional volume and (N^2-2)-dimensional
hyperarea of the (separable and nonseparable) N x N density matrices, based on
the Bures (minimal monotone) metric -- and also their analogous formulas
(quant-ph/0302197) for the (non-monotone) Hilbert-Schmidt metric. With the same
seven billion well-distributed (``low-discrepancy'') sample points, we estimate
the unknown volumes and hyperareas based on five additional (monotone) metrics
of interest, including the Kubo-Mori and Wigner-Yanase. Further, we estimate
all of these seven volume and seven hyperarea (unknown) quantities when
restricted to the separable density matrices. The ratios of separable volumes
(hyperareas) to separable plus nonseparable volumes (hyperareas) yield
estimates of the separability probabilities of generically rank-six (rank-five)
density matrices. The (rank-six) separability probabilities obtained based on
the 35-dimensional volumes appear to be -- independently of the metric (each of
the seven inducing Haar measure) employed -- twice as large as those (rank-five
ones) based on the 34-dimensional hyperareas. Accepting such a relationship, we
fit exact formulas to the estimates of the Bures and Hilbert-Schmidt separable
volumes and hyperareas.(An additional estimate -- 33.9982 -- of the ratio of
the rank-6 Hilbert-Schmidt separability probability to the rank-4 one is quite
clearly close to integral too.) The doubling relationship also appears to hold
for the N=4 case for the Hilbert-Schmidt metric, but not the others. We fit
exact formulas for the Hilbert-Schmidt separable volumes and hyperareas.

  structure</title><description>  Mathematical foundation of the novel concept of quantum tensor product by
Zanardi et al is rigorously established. The concept of relative quantum
entanglement is naturally introduced and its meaning is made clear both
mathematically and physically. For a finite or an infinite dimensional vector
space $W$ the so called tensor product partition (TPP) is introduced on
$End(W)$, the set of endmorphisms of $W$, and a natural correspondence is
constructed between the set of TPP's of $End(W)$ and the set of tensor product
structures (TPS's) of $W$. As a byproduct, it is shown that an arbitrarily
given wave function belonging to an n-dimensional Hilbert space, $n$ being not
a prime number, can be interpreted as a separable state with respect to some
man-made TPS, and thus a quantum entangled state of a many-body system with
respect to the &quot;God-given&quot; TPS can be regarded as a quantum state without
entanglement in some sense. The concept of standard set of observables is also
introduced to probe the underlying structure of the object TPP and to establish
its connection with practical physical measurement.

noninteracting eigenfunctions and transition from integrability to quantum
chaos. Contrary to what occurs in a quantum phase transition, the onset of
quantum chaos is not a property of the ground state but take place for any

field as a probe of the black hole gravitational background, for a general
class of metrics in D spacetime dimensions (with $D \geq 4$). The ensuing
analysis is based on conformal quantum mechanics, within a hierarchical
near-horizon expansion. In particular, the leading conformal behavior provides
the correct quantum statistical properties for the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy,
with the near-horizon physics governing the thermodynamic properties from the
outset. Most importantly: (i) this treatment reveals the emergence of
holographic properties; (ii) the conformal coupling parameter is shown to be
related to the Hawking temperature; and (iii) Schwarzschild-like coordinates,
despite their ``coordinate singularity,''can be used self-consistently to
describe the thermodynamics of black holes.

extending the usual concepts of distinguishability and visibility to these
types of systems. Distinguishability will refer now to the balance between
common and different modes of a two-particle system, instead of the standard
definition concerning available alternatives for a one-particle system. On the
other hand, the usual concept of visibility is not suitable for our problem and
must be replaced with that of contrast, measuring the ratio of detection
probabilities with and without interference effects. Finally, we show that for
the type of states considered in the paper there is a complementarity relation
between distinguishability and contrast for two-bosons systems. In contrast,
there is no two-fermion counterpart.

laser pulses having a wavelength of 390nm. We find single ionization
suppression in O$_2$ and its absence in F$_2$, in accordance with experimental
results at $\lambda = 800$nm. Within our framework of time-dependent density
functional theory we are able to explain deviations from the predictions of
Intense-Field Many-Body $S$-Matrix Theory (IMST). We confirm the connection of
ionization suppression with destructive interference of outgoing electron waves
from the ionized electron orbital. However, the prediction of ionization
suppression, justified within the IMST approach through the symmetry of the
highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), is not reliable since it turns out
that, e.g. in the case of F$_2$, the electronic response to the laser pulse is
rather complicated and does not lead to dominant depletion of the HOMO.
Therefore, the symmetry of the HOMO is not sufficient to predict ionization
suppression. However, at least for F$_2$, the symmetry of the dominantly
ionized orbital is consistent with the non-suppression of ionization.

terms of two-by-two matrices. If two oscillators are coupled, the problem
combines both two-by-two matrices and harmonic oscillators. This method then
becomes a powerful research tool to cover many different branches of physics.
Indeed, the concept and methodology in one branch of physics can be translated
into another through the common mathematical formalism. Coupled oscillators
provide clear illustrative examples for some of the current issues in physics,
including entanglement, decoherence, and Feynman's rest of the universe. In
addition, it is noted that the present form of quantum mechanics is largely a
physics of harmonic oscillators. Special relativity is the physics of the
Lorentz group which can be represented by the group of by two-by-two matrices
commonly called $SL(2,c)$. Thus the coupled harmonic oscillators can therefore
play the role of combining quantum mechanics with special relativity. Both Paul
A. M. Dirac and Richard P. Feynman were fond of harmonic oscillators, while
they used different approaches to physical problems. Both were also keenly
interested in making quantum mechanics compatible with special relativity. It
is shown that the coupled harmonic oscillators can bridge these two different
approaches to physics.

a bosonic thermal bath. This is possible due to different initial temperatures
of the spin and the bath, both positive (no spin population inversion) and is
realized by means of a suitable sequence of sharp pulses applied to the spin.
The extracted work can be of the order of the response energy of the bath,
therefore much larger than the energy of the spin. Moreover, the efficiency of
extraction can be very close to its maximum, given by the Carnot bound, at the
same time the overall amount of the extracted work is maximal. Therefore, we
get a finite power at efficiency close to the Carnot bound.
  The effect comes from the backreaction of the spin on the bath, and it
survives for a strongly disordered (inhomogeneously broadened) ensemble of
spins. It is connected with generation of coherences during the work-extraction
process, and we derived it in an exactly solvable model. All the necessary
general thermodynamical relations are derived from the first principles of
quantum mechanics and connections are made with processes of lasing without
inversion and with quantum heat engines.

two-dimensional quantum state in a fixed period of time. We further show that
such networks can distribute arbitrary entangled states between two distant
parties, and can, by using such systems in parallel, transmit the higher
dimensional systems states across the network. Unlike many other schemes for
quantum computation and communication, these networks do not require qubit
couplings to be switched on and off. When restricted to $N$-qubit spin networks
of identical qubit couplings, we show that $2\log_3 N$ is the maximal perfect
communication distance for hypercube geometries. Moreover, if one allows fixed
but different couplings between the qubits then perfect state transfer can be
achieved over arbitrarily long distances in a linear chain. This paper expands

Depending on the pulse interval conditions, the cross over from the decoherence
acceleration regime to the decoherence suppression regime, which is a peculiar
feature of the coherent interaction between a qubit and the reservoir bosons,
may be observed in the time-integated multiwave mixing signals in the realistic

author of this paper is also the author of a quantum compiler called Qubiter.
Qubiter uses a matrix decomposition called the Cosine-Sine Decomposition (CSD)

measuring the efficiency of a quantum compiler is to measure the number of
CNOTs it uses to express an unstructured unitary matrix (a unitary matrix with

In this paper, we show how to improve $\epsilon$ for Qubiter so that it matches

using symmetry techniques that this problem reduces to computing the bounds on

the bounds differ from those on classical Liouville distributions. In

problem $-u^{\prime\prime}(z)+[(-1)^{\ell}(iz)^m-P(iz)]u(z)=\lambda u(z)$ with
the boundary conditions that $u(z)$ decays to zero as $z$ tends to infinity
along the rays $\arg z=-\frac{\pi}{2}\pm \frac{(\ell+1)\pi}{m+2}$ in the
complex plane, where $P(z)=a_1 z^{m-1}+a_2 z^{m-2}+...+a_{m-1} z$ is a
polynomial. We provide asymptotic expansions of the eigenvalue counting
function and the eigenvalues $\lambda_{n}$. Then we apply these to the inverse
spectral problem, reconstructing some coefficients of polynomial potentials
from asymptotic expansions of the eigenvalues. Also, we show for arbitrary
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric polynomial potentials of degree $m\geq 3$ and all
symmetric decaying boundary conditions that the eigenvalues are all real and
positive, with only finitely many exceptions.

protocol for quantum key distributoin (QKD) using 4 different intensities of
pulses. They are vacuum and coherent states with mean photon number $\mu,\mu'$
and $\mu_s$. $\mu_s$ is around 0.55 and this class of pulses are used as the
main signal states. The other two classes of coherent states ($\mu,\mu'$) are
also used signal states but their counting rates should be studied jointly with
the vacuum. We have shown that, given the typical set-up in practice, the key

maximal rate in the case given the small overall transmittance of $10^{-4}$.

Building on the quantum fingerprinting protocol of Buhrman et al., Yao recently
showed that a large class of efficient classical public-coin protocols can be
turned into efficient quantum protocols without public coin. This raises the
question whether this can be done always, i.e. whether quantum communication
can always replace a public coin in the SMP model. We answer this question in
the negative, exhibiting a communication problem where classical communication
with public coin is exponentially more efficient than quantum communication.
Together with a separation in the other direction due to Bar-Yossef et al.,
this shows that the quantum SMP model is incomparable with the classical
public-coin SMP model.
  In addition we give a characterization of the power of quantum fingerprinting
by means of a connection to geometrical tools from machine learning, a
quadratic improvement of Yao's simulation, and a nearly tight analysis of the
Hamming distance problem from Yao's paper.

group delay to be negative. It is shown that this negative group delay is
closely related to its anomalous dependence on the width of the potential well.
In order to demonstrate the validity of stationary-phase approach, numerical

to the potential-well's width is obtained that is necessary for the wave packet
to remain distortionless in the travelling. Numerical comparison shows that the

  Oscillator</title><description>  Careful monitoring of harmonically bound (or as a limiting case, free) masses
is the basis of current and future gravitational wave detectors, and of
nanomechanical devices designed to access the quantum regime. We analyze the
effects of stochastic localization models for state vector reduction, and of
related models for environmental decoherence, on such systems, focusing our
analysis on the non-dissipative forced harmonic oscillator, and its free mass
limit. We derive an explicit formula for the time evolution of the expectation
of a general operator in the presence of stochastic reduction or
environmentally induced decoherence, for both the non-dissipative harmonic
oscillator and the free mass. In the case of the oscillator, we also give a
formula for the time evolution of the matrix element of the stochastic
expectation density matrix between general coherent states. We show that the
stochastic expectation of the variance of a Hermitian operator in any
unraveling of the stochastic process is bounded by the variance computed from
the stochastic expectation of the density matrix, and we develop a formal
perturbation theory for calculating expectation values of operators within any
unraveling. Applying our results to current gravitational wave interferometer
detectors and nanomechanical systems, we conclude that the deviations from
quantum mechanics predicted by the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL)
model of state vector reduction are at least five orders of magnitude below the
relevant standard quantum limits for these experiments. The proposed LISA
gravitational wave detector will be two orders of magnitude away from the
capability of observing an effect.

production of entangled four-photon states of GHZ type. From the GHZ state, two
fully entangled photons can be obtained by a measurement of two photons in the
linear polarization basis, even for quantum dots with observable fine structure
splitting for neutral excitons and significant exciton spin decoherence.
Because of the interplay of quantum mechanical selection rules and
interference, maximally entangled electron pairs are converted into maximally

directions. We describe the dynamics of the conversion process using a
master-equation approach and show that the implementation of our scheme is

reached via two possible paths, with a {\it spontaneous} Raman transition
occurring either during the ingoing or the outgoing part of the trajectory. At
first sight, one might expect that the spontaneous character of the Raman
transfer would destroy the coherence and thus the interference. We investigated
this problem by numerically solving the Schr\&quot;odinger equation and applying a
Monte-Carlo wave-function approach. We find interference fringes in velocity
space, even when random photon recoils are taken into account.

the classical scenario and which can present interesting advantages. In this
work, we show how the entanglement and the relative phase between the states
describing the coin degree of freedom of each particle will influence the

one particle in a certain position after $N$ steps of the walk, as well as the
average distance between the two particles, can be larger or smaller than the
case of two unentangled particles, depending on the initial conditions we
choose. This resource can then be tuned according to our needs, in particular
to enhance a given application (algorithmic or other) based on a quantum walk.

  harmonic oscillators: a route to unitary gates for Fock State qubits</title><description>  We present a simple quantum circuit that allows for the universal and
deterministic manipulation of the quantum state of confined harmonic
oscillators. The scheme is based on the selective interactions of the referred
oscillator with an auxiliary three-level system and a classical external
driving source, and enables any unitary operations on Fock states, two-by-two.
One circuit is equivalent to a single qubit unitary logical gate on Fock states
qubits. Sequences of similar protocols allow for complete, deterministic and

experiment, suggests that any finite precision measurement disturbs any
observables noncommuting with the measured observable. Here, it is shown that
this statement contradicts the limit of the accuracy of measurements under
conservation laws originally found by Wigner in 1950s, and should be modified
to correctly derive the unavoidable noise caused by the conservation law
induced decoherence. The obtained accuracy limit leads to an interesting
conclusion that a widely accepted, but rather naive, physical encoding of
qubits for quantum computing suffers significantly from the decoherence induced
by the angular momentum conservation law.

  coherent forward scattering</title><description>  Quantum theoretical treatment of coherent forward scattering of light in a
polarized atomic ensemble with an arbitrary angular momentum is developed. We
consider coherent forward scattering of a weak radiation field interacting with
a realistic multi-level atomic transition. Based on the concept of an effective
Hamiltonian and on the Heisenberg formalism, we discuss the coupled dynamics of
the quantum fluctuations of the polarization Stokes components of propagating
light and of the collective spin fluctuations of the scattering atoms. We show
that in the process of coherent forward scattering this dynamics can be
described in terms of a polariton-type spin wave created in the atomic sample.
Our work presents a general example of entangling process in the system of
collective quantum states of light and atomic angular momenta, previously
considered only for the case of spin-1/2 atoms. We use the developed general
formalism to test the applicability of spin-1/2 approximation for modelling the
quantum non-demolishing measurement of atoms with a higher angular momentum.

semiclassical phase, given by a series in $\hbar$, yields more or less
approximate results and eventually diverges due to the asymptotic nature of the

exact quantization of nonsolvable potentials and allows to obtain the quantum
wavefunction while locally approaching the best pre-divergent semiclassical

with a modest computational cost is also given. The theory is illustrated on
two examples for which the limitations of the semiclassical approach were

  It is shown that the $\chi$-function of an arbitrary channel is a concave
lower semicontinuous function on the whole state space, having continuous
restriction to any set of continuity of the output entropy.
  The explicit representation for the convex closure of the output entropy is
obtained and its properties are explored. It is shown that the convex closure
of the output entropy coincides with the convex hull of the output entropy on
the convex set of states with finite output entropy. Similarly to the case of
the $\chi$-function, it is proved that the convex closure of the output entropy
has continuous restriction to any set of continuity of output entropy. Some
applications of these results to the theory of entanglement are discussed.
  The obtained properties of the convex closure of the output entropy make it
possible to generalize to the infinite dimensional case the convex duality
approach to the additivity problem.

(MLE) approach, already known to apply to quantum state tomography, is also
applicable to quantum process tomography (estimating the Kraus operator sum
representation (OSR)), Hamiltonian parameter estimation, and the related
problems of state and process (OSR) distribution estimation. Except for
Hamiltonian parameter estimation, the other MLE problems are formally of the
same type of convex optimization problem and therefore can be solved very
efficiently to within any desired accuracy.
  Associated with each of these estimation problems, and the focus of the
paper, is an optimal experiment design (OED) problem invoked by the Cramer-Rao
Inequality: find the number of experiments to be performed in a particular
system configuration to maximize estimation accuracy; a configuration being any
number of combinations of sample times, hardware settings, prepared initial

Hamiltonian parameter estimation, the optimal experiment design can be obtained
by solving a convex optimization problem.

Using a generating function formalism we solve the generalized optical Bloch

motional narrowing when the stochastic modulation is fast, and power
broadening. The Mandel parameter, describing the line shape fluctuations,

systems, and study the associated bisymmetric multimode Gaussian states. They
are defined as $(m+n)$-mode Gaussian states invariant under local mode
permutations on the $m$-mode and $n$-mode subsystems. We prove that such states
are equivalent, under local unitary transformations, to the tensor product of a

populations is an important problem with applications to Quantum Chemistry and
Atomic Physics. In this work we consider exact population transfers that
minimize the L^2 norm of the control which is typically the amplitude of an
electromagnetic field. This problem is analytically and numerically
challenging. Except for few exactly solvable cases, there is no general
understanding of the nature of optimal controls and trajectories. We find that
by examining the limit of large transfer times, we can uncover such general
properties. In particular, for transfer times large with respect to the time
scale of the free dynamics of the quantum system, the optimal control is a sum
of components, each being a Bohr frequency sinusoid modulated by a slow
amplitude, i.e. a profile that changes considerably only on the scale of the
transfer time. Moreover, we show that the optimal trajectory follows a &quot;mean''
evolution modulated by the fast free dynamics of the system. The calculation of
the &quot;mean'' optimal trajectory and the slow control profiles is done via an
&quot;averaged'' two-point boundary value problem which we derive and which is much
easier to solve than the one expressing the necessary conditions for optimality
of the original optimal transfer problem.

at a constant velocity $v$ in the same direction as an incident wave function
by means of solving the time-dependent Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation. As for an
infinite potential step, it is known that group velocity is the same as the
moving velocity of the potential step. We found two interesting results when
the potential step has a finite height of $V_0$. The transmission occurs when
the kinetic energy of incident wave function is larger than the effective
potential hight of $(\sqrt{\frac{m}{2}}v + \sqrt{V_0})^2$. The other result is
that the reflectivity depends on $x$, which derives from the interference
between the incident and the reflected wave functions.

Schroedinger Equation (SSE) in order to treat the exact quantum dynamics of two
interacting systems, is first described. In this work the non-uniqueness of
such stochastic Schroedinger equations is investigated to propose strategies to
optimize the stochastic paths and reduce statistical fluctuations. In the
proposed method, called the 'adaptative noise method', a specific SSE is
obtained for which the noise depends explicitly on both the initial state and
on the properties of the interaction Hamiltonian. It is also shown that this
method can be further improved by introduction of a mean-field dynamics. The
different optimization procedures are illustrated quantitatively in the case of
interacting spins. A significant reduction of the statistical fluctuations is
obtained. Consequently a much smaller number of trajectories is needed to
accurately reproduce the exact dynamics as compared to the SSE without
optimization.

algorithm that, for any class C, identifies any unknown function from C using
$O(\frac{\log |C| \log \log |C|}{\sqrt{{\hat{\gamma}}^{C}}})$ quantum black-box
queries.
  We consider a range of natural problems intermediate between the exact
learning problem (in which the learner must obtain all bits of information
about the black-box function) and the usual problem of computing a predicate
(in which the learner must obtain only one bit of information about the
black-box function). We give positive and negative results on when the quantum
and classical query complexities of these intermediate problems are
polynomially related to each other.
  Finally, we improve the known lower bounds on the number of quantum examples
(as opposed to quantum black-box queries) required for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-PAC
learning any concept class of Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension d over the domain
$\{0,1\}^n$ from $\Omega(\frac{d}{n})$ to $\Omega(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log
\frac{1}{\delta}+d+\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\epsilon})$. This new lower bound comes
closer to matching known upper bounds for classical PAC learning.

quantum process tomography, by first modeling them in an extended Hilbert
space, which includes non-qubit degrees of freedom. To prevent unphysical
processes from being predicted, present quantum process tomography procedures
incorporate mathematical constraints, which make no assumptions as to the
actual physical nature of the system being described. By contrast, the
procedure presented here ensures physicality by placing physical constraints on
the nature of quantum processes. This allows quantum process tomography to be
performed using a smaller experimental data set, and produces parameters with a
direct physical interpretation. The approach is demonstrated by example of
mode-matching in an all-optical controlled-NOT gate. The techniques described

field in which the discrete vector indices in Maxwell\s equations are replaced
by continuous angular freedoms, and develop the corresponding Lagrangian
picture in which the fluid particles have rotational and translational
freedoms. This enables us to extend to the electromagnetic field the exact
method of state construction proposed previously for spin 0 systems, in which
the time-dependent wavefunction is computed from a single-valued continuum of
deterministic trajectories where two spacetime points are linked by at most a
single orbit. The deduction of Maxwell\s equations from continuum mechanics is
achieved by generalizing the spin 0 theory to a general Riemannian manifold
from which the electromagnetic construction is extracted as a special case. In
particular, the flat-space Maxwell equations are represented as a curved-space
Schr\&quot;odinger equation for a massive system. The Lorentz covariance of the
Eulerian field theory is obtained from the non-covariant Lagrangian-coordinate
model as a kind of collective effect. The method makes manifest the
electromagnetic analogue of the quantum potential that is tacit in Maxwell\s
equations. This implies a novel definition of the \classical limit\ of
Maxwell\s equations that differs from geometrical optics. It is shown that
Maxwell\s equations may be obtained by canonical quantization of the classical
model. Using the classical trajectories a novel expression is derived for the
propagator of the electromagnetic field in the Eulerian picture. The trajectory
and propagator methods of solution are illustrated for the case of a light

But, perfect copying is possible, if it is known that unknown states to be
copied is contained by the set of orthogonal states, which is called the copied
set. However, if our operation is limited to local operations and classical
communications, this problem is not trivial. Recently, F. Anselmi, A. Chefles
and M.B. Plenio constructed theory of local copying when the copied set
consists of maximally entangled states. They also classified the copied set
when it consists of two orthogonal states (New. J. Phys. 6, 164 (2004)). In
this paper, we completely classify the copied set of local copying of the
maximally entangled states in the prime dimensional system. That is, we prove
that, in the prime dimensional system, the set of locally copiable maximally
entangled states is equivalent to the set of Simultaneously Schmidt
decomposable canonical form Bell states. As a result, we conclude that local
copying of maximally entangled states is much more difficult than local
discrimination at least in prime dimensional systems.

state may alter the decay rate of the state. This is called the quantum Zeno
effect (QZE) or the anti-Zeno effect (AZE), depending on whether the decay is
suppressed or enhanced. In conventional theories of the QZE and AZE, effects of
measurements are simply described by the projection postulate, assuming that
each measurement is an instantaneous and ideal one. However, real measurements
are not instantaneous and ideal. For the QZE and AZE by such general
measurements, interesting and surprising features have recently been revealed,
which we review in this article. The results are based on the quantum
measurement theory, which is also reviewed briefly. As a typical model, we
consider a continuous measurement of the decay of an excited atom by a
photodetector that detects a photon emitted from the atom upon decay. This
measurement is an indirect negative-result one, for which the curiosity of the
QZE and AZE is emphasized. It is shown that the form factor is renormalized as
a backaction of the measurement, through which the decay dynamics is modified.
In a special case of the flat response, where the detector responds to every
photon mode with an identical response time, results of the conventional
theories are reproduced qualitatively. However, drastic differences emerge in
general cases where the detector responds only to limited photon modes. For
example, against predictions of the conventional theories, the QZE or AZE may
take place even for states that exactly follow the exponential decay law. We
also discuss relation to the cavity quantum electrodynamics.

compare and contrast the performance of these quantum walks with that of a
classical random walk consisting of one walker and two maximally correlated

  We illustrate that the behaviour of our walk with entangled coins can be very
different in comparison to the usual quantum walk with a single coin. We also
demonstrate that simply by changing the shift operator, we can generate widely
different distributions. We also compare the behaviour of quantum walks with

Finally, we show that the use of different shift operators on 2 and 3 qubit

Gaussian decay when the perturbation affects the frequency of periodic phase
space orbits and power-law decay when the perturbation changes the shape of the
orbits. For both behaviors the decay rate also depends on initial state
location. The spectrum of the initial states in the eigenbasis of the system

deterministic Boltzmann-like equation. All physical information is derived from
the solution of this equation, which is a function of space and momentum. The
additional terms in this equation, when compared with the classical Boltzmann
equation, asserts that the particle should be broadened over the time axis,
i.e., it is partly present at the past, the present, and the future. The
solution of this equation itself is nonlocal. This solution requires an
especial time coordinate that is different from the usual time parameter
entering into the formalism of quantum mechanics. This time coordinate is
hidden in the structure of wave function. It is substantiated that the mixed
state is a natural result of time broadening. Furthermore, the interaction
between an object that is broadened in time and an observer that has a very
narrow time-width leads to the collapse of wave function.

H and its Hermitian counterpart h, obtained from H by a similarity
transformation, as pointed out by Mostafazadeh. In the first model, due to
Swanson, h turns out to be just a scaled harmonic oscillator, which explains
the form of its spectrum. However, the transformation is not unique, which also
means that the observables of the original theory are not uniquely determined
by H alone. The second model we consider is the original PT-invariant
Hamiltonian, with potential V=igx^3. In this case the corresponding h, which we
are only able to construct in perturbation theory, corresponds to a complicated
velocity-dependent potential. We again explore the relationship between the
canonical variables x and p and the observables X and P.

'quantum eraser' interference experiments, which present a complementarity
between information gathered from a quantum measurement and interference
effects. It has been argued that these experiments show the Bohm interpretation
of quantum theory is untenable. We demonstrate that these experiments depend
critically upon the assumption that a quantum optics device can operate as a
measuring device, and show that, in the context of these experiments, it cannot
be consistently understood in this way. By contrast, we then show how the
notion of 'active information' in the Bohm interpretation provides a coherent
explanation of the phenomena shown in these experiments.
  We then examine the relationship between information and entropy. The thought
experiment connecting these two quantities is the Szilard Engine version of
Maxwell's Demon, and it has been suggested that quantum measurement plays a key
role in this. We provide the first complete description of the operation of the
Szilard Engine as a quantum system. This enables us to demonstrate that the
role of quantum measurement suggested is incorrect, and further, that the use
of information theory to resolve Szilard's paradox is both unnecessary and
insufficient. Finally we show that, if the concept of 'active information' is
extended to cover thermal density matrices, then many of the conceptual
problems raised by this paradox appear to be resolved.

methods, of measurement-induced localization of relational degrees of freedom.
Looking first at the interference of two optical modes, we find that the
localization of the relative phase can be as good for mixed states - in
particular for two initially Poissonian or thermal states - as for the
well-known case of two Fock states. In a realistic setup the localization for
mixed states is robust and experimentally accessible, and we discuss
applications to superselection rules. For an ideal setup and initial Fock
states we show how a relational Schr\&quot;{o}dinger cat state emerges, and
investigate circumstances under which such a state is destroyed. In our second
example we consider the localization of relative atomic phase between two Bose
Einstein condensates, looking particularly at the build up of spatial
interference patterns, an area which has attracted much attention since the
work of Javanainen and Yoo. We show that the relative phase localizes much
faster than was intimated in previous studies focusing on the emerging
interference pattern itself. Finally, we explore the localization of relative
spatial parameters discussed in recent work by Rau, Dunningham and Burnett. We
retain their models of indistinguishable scattering but make different
assumptions. In particular we consider the case of a real distant observer
monitoring light scattering off two particles, who records events only from a
narrow field of view. The localization is only partial regardless of the number
of observations. This paper contributes to the wider debate on relationism in
quantum mechanics, which treats fundamental concepts - reference frames and
conservation laws - from a fully quantum and operational perspective.

We
will show that there can be established a connection between these two areas.
This will at the same time suggest a new, less formalistic way of looking upon
basic quantum theory.
  A total parameter space $\Phi$, equipped with a group $G$ of transformations,
gives the mental image of some quantum system, in such a way that only certain
components, functions of the total parameter $\phi$ can be estimated. Choose an
experiment/ question $a$, and get from this a parameter space $\Lambda^{a}$,
perhaps after some model reduction compatible with the group structure.
  The essentially statistical construction of this paper leads under natural
assumptions to the basic axioms of quantum mechanics, and thus implies a new
statistical interpretation of this traditionally very formal theory. The
probabilities are introduced via Born's formula, and this formula is proved
from general, reasonable assumptions, essentially symmetry assumptions.
  The theory is illustrated by a simple macroscopic example, and by the example
of a spin 1/2 particle. As a last example we show a connection to inference
between related macroscropic experiments under symmetry.

relativity and of quantum mechanics. As a key feature, the laws are formulated
in terms of quantum events rather than of particle states. Temporal and spatial
coordinates of a quantum event are treated on equal footing, namely as
self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space. The theory is not based upon
Lagrangian or Hamiltonian mechanics, and breaks with the concept of a
continuously flowing time. The physical object under consideration is a
spinless particle exposed to an external potential. The theory also accounts
for particle-antiparticle pair creation and annihilation, and is therefore not
a single-particle theory in the usual sense. The Maxwell equations are derived
as a straightforward consequence of certain fundamental commutation relations.
In the non-relativistic limit and in the limit of vanishing time uncertainty,
the Schr\&quot;odinger equation of a spinless particle exposed to an external
electromagnetic field is obtained.

the unsolvability of the halting problem, which is permitted in classical
logic, shows that such systems cannot exist. Turing's argument fails in the
recently proposed non-Aristotelian finitary logic (NAFL), which permits the
existence of ACS. NAFL also justifies quantum superposition and entanglement,
which are essential ingredients of quantum algorithms, and resolves the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox in favour of quantum mechanics and
non-locality. NAFL requires that the autonomic manager (AM) must be
conceptually and architecturally distinct from the managed element, in order
for the ACS to exist as a non-self-referential entity. Such a scenario is
possible if the AM uses quantum algorithms and is protected from all problems
by (unbreakable) quantum encryption, while the managed element remains
classical. NAFL supports such a link between autonomic and quantum computing,
with the AM existing as a metamathematical entity. NAFL also allows quantum
algorithms to access truly random elements and thereby supports non-standard
models of quantum (hyper-) computation that permit infinite parallelism.

factoring; and (iv) the precise sense in which a quantum computer employing
Shor's algorithm can be said to accomplish the factoring of very large numbers
with less computational effort than a classical computer can. It is made
apparent that factoring $N$ generally requires many successive runs of the

harmonic oscillator is applied for the description of the charge equilibration
mode observed in deep inelastic reactions. For a system consisting of two

  versus amplitude scattering</title><description>  We study the effect of surface scattering on transport properties in
many-mode conducting channels (electron waveguides). Assuming a strong
roughness of the surface profiles, we show that there are two independent
control parameters that determine statistical properties of the scattering. The
first parameter is the ratio of the amplitude of the roughness to the
transverse width of the waveguide. The second one, which is typically omitted,
is determined by the mean value of the derivative of the profile. This
parameter may be large, thus leading to specific properties of scattering. Our
results may be used in experimental realizations of the surface scattering of
electron waves, as well as for other applications (e.g., for optical and

two-dimensional spaces of non-constant curvature: these spaces are called
Darboux spaces $\DI$--$\DIV$. We start each consideration in terms of the
metric and then analyze the quantum theory in the separable coordinate systems.
The path integral in each case is formulated and then solved in the majority of
cases, the exceptions being quartic oscillators where no closed solution is
known. The required ingredients are the path integral solutions of the linear
potential, the harmonic oscillator, the radial harmonic oscillator, the
modified P\&quot;oschl--Teller potential, and for spheroidal wave-functions,
respectively. The basic path integral solutions, which appear here in a
complicated way, have been developed in recent work and are known. The final
solutions are represented in terms of the corresponding Green's functions and
the expansions into the wave-functions, respectively. We also sketch some
limiting cases of the Darboux spaces, where spaces of constant negative and
zero curvature emerge.

$O(\sqrt{N\log{M}/\log{N}})$, matching the lower bound proved in

attention because of their promise for scalability and their potential for
synergetically utilizing the available resources associated with the existing
Si technology infrastructure. Electronic and nuclear spins of shallow donors
(e.g. phosphorus) in Si are ideal candidates for qubits in such proposals
because of their long spin coherence times due to their limited interactions
with their environments. For these spin qubits, shallow donor exchange gates
are frequently invoked to perform two-qubit operations. We discuss in this
review a particularly important spin decoherence channel, and bandstructure
effects on the exchange gate control. Specifically, we review our work on donor
electron spin spectral diffusion due to background nuclear spin flip-flops, and
how isotopic purification of silicon can significantly enhance the electron
spin dephasing time. We then review our calculation of donor electron exchange
coupling in the presence of degenerate silicon conduction band valleys. We show
that valley interference leads to orders of magnitude variations in electron
exchange coupling when donor configurations are changed on an atomic scale.
These studies illustrate the substantial potential that donor electron/nuclear
spins in silicon have as candidates for qubits and simultaneously the
considerable challenges they pose. In particular, our work on spin decoherence
through spectral diffusion points to the possible importance of isotopic
purification in the fabrication of scalable solid state quantum computer
architectures. We also provide a critical comparison between the two main
proposed spin-based solid state quantum computer architectures, namely, shallow
donor bound states in Si and localized quantum dot states in GaAs.

In deformation quantization, considered as an autonomous formulation of quantum
mechanics, the Wigner function of stationary states must be found by solving
the so-called $\*$-genvalue (``stargenvalue'') equation for the Hamiltonian.
For the cases considered here, this pseudo-differential equation is difficult
to solve directly, without an ad hoc modification of the potential. Here we
treat the infinite wall as the limit of a solvable exponential potential.
Before the limit is taken, the corresponding $\*$-genvalue equation involves
the Wigner function at momenta translated by imaginary amounts. We show that it
can be converted to a partial differential equation, however, with a
well-defined limit. We demonstrate that the Wigner functions calculated from

Finally, we show how our results may be adapted to allow for the presence of

However, the negative dispersions for the velocity and position in the
longitudinal directions, which could be interpreted as reducing the quantum
uncertainties of the particle, acquire positive corrections due to the presence
of the second plate, and are thus weakened.

  for quantum channels with inefficient measurements</title><description>  The Holevo bound is a bound on the mutual information for a given quantum
encoding. In 1996 Schumacher, Westmoreland and Wootters [Schumacher,
Westmoreland and Wootters, Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 3452 (1996)] derived a bound
which reduces to the Holevo bound for complete measurements, but which is
tighter for incomplete measurements. The most general quantum operations may be
both incomplete and inefficient. Here we show that the bound derived by SWW can
be further extended to obtain one which is yet again tighter for inefficient
measurements. This allows us in addition to obtain a generalization of a bound
derived by Hall, and to show that the average reduction in the von Neumann
entropy during a quantum operation is concave in the initial state, for all
quantum operations. This is a quantum version of the concavity of the mutual
information. We also show that both this average entropy reduction, and the
mutual information for pure state ensembles, are Schur-concave for unitarily
covariant measurements; that is, for these measurements, information gain
increases with initial uncertainty.

physics and mathematics. It states that the entropy S[\rho]= - Tr (\rho \ln
\rho) of a density matrix \rho_{123} on the product of three Hilbert spaces
satisfies S[\rho_{123}] - S[\rho_{23}] \leq S[\rho_{12}]- S[\rho_2]. We
strengthen this to S[\rho_{123}] - S[\rho_{12}] \leq \sum_\alpha n^\alpha
(S[\rho_{23}^\alpha ] - S[\rho_2^\alpha ]), where the n^\alpha are weights and
the \rho_{23}^\alpha are partitions of \rho_{23}. Correspondingly, there is a
strengthening of the theorem that the map A -&gt; Tr \exp[L + \ln A] is concave.
As applications we prove some monotonicity and convexity properties of the
Wehrl entropy and entropy inequalities for quantum gases.

  Perturbation</title><description>  We study fidelity decay by a uniform semiclassical approach, in the three
perturbation regimes, namely, the perturbative regime, the Fermi-golden-rule
(FGR) regime, and the Lyapunov regime.
  A semiclassical expression is derived for fidelity of initial Gaussian wave
packets with width of the order $\sqrt{\hbar}$
  ($\hbar$ being the effective Planck constant).
  Short time decay of fidelity of initial Gaussian wave packets is also
studied, with respect to two time scales introduced in the semiclassical
approach.
  In the perturbative regime, it is confirmed numerically that fidelity has the
FGR decay before the Gaussian decay sets in.
  An explanation is suggested to a non-FGR decay in the FGR regime, which has
been observed in a system with weak chaos in the classical limit, by using the
Levy distribution as an approximation for the distribution of action
difference.
  In the Lyapunov regime, it is shown that the average of the logarithm of
fidelity may have roughly the Lyapunov decay within some time interval, in
systems possessing large fluctuation of the finite-time Lyapunov exponent in
the classical limit.

  Representation Theory of the Heisenberg Group</title><description>  This thesis is concerned with the representation theory of the Heisenberg
group and its applications to both classical and quantum mechanics. We continue
the development of $p$-mechanics which is a consistent physical theory capable
of describing both classical and quantum mechanics simultaneously.
$p$-Mechanics starts from the observation that the one dimensional
representations of the Heisenberg group play the same role in classical
mechanics which the infinite dimensional representations play in quantum
mechanics.
  In this thesis we introduce the idea of states to $p$-mechanics.
$p$-Mechanical states come in two forms: elements of a Hilbert space and
integration kernels. In developing $p$-mechanical states we show that quantum
probability amplitudes can be obtained using solely functions/distributions on
the Heisenberg group. This theory is applied to the examples of the forced,
harmonic and coupled oscillators. In doing so we show that both the quantum and
classical dynamics of these systems can be derived from the same source. Also
using $p$-mechanics we simplify some of the current quantum mechanical
calculations.
  We also analyse the role of both linear and non-linear canonical
transformations in $p$-mechanics. We enhance a method derived by Moshinsky for
studying the passage of canonical transformations from classical to quantum
mechanics. The Kepler/Coulomb problem is also examined in the $p$-mechanical
context. In analysing this problem we show some limitations of the current
$p$-mechanical approach. We then use Klauder's coherent states to generate a
Hilbert space which is particularly useful for the Kepler/Coulomb problem.

are taken as effective potentials in a position-dependent effective mass (PDEM)
one. The corresponding shape-invariance condition turns out to be deformed. Its
solvability imposes the form of both the deformed superpotential and the PDEM.
A lot of new exactly solvable potentials associated with a PDEM background are
generated in this way. A novel and important condition restricting the
existence of bound states whenever the PDEM vanishes at an end point of the
interval is identified. In some cases, the bound-state spectrum results from a
smooth deformation of that of the conventional shape-invariant potential used
in the construction. In others, one observes a generation or suppression of
bound states, depending on the mass-parameter values. The corresponding
wavefunctions are given in terms of some deformed classical orthogonal
polynomials.

mathematical wave-pattern recognition theory emerged in the 70's in connection
with the problems of optimal estimation and hypothesis testing in quantum
theory. In quantum theory such problems are sometimes referred as the problem
of optimal measurement of an unknown quantum state, and are the main subject of
the emerging mathematical theory of quantum statistics.
  We develop the results of quantum pattern recognition theory, most of which
belong to VPB, further into the direction of wave, rather than particle
statistical estimation and hypothesis testing theory, with the aim to include
not only quantum matter waves but also classical wave patterns like optical and
acoustic waves. We conclude that Hilbert space and operator methods developed
in quantum theory are equally useful in the classical wave theory, as soon as
the possible observations are restricted to only intensity distributions of
waves, i.e. when the wave states are not the allowed observables, as they are
not the observables of individual particles in the quantum theory. We show that
all characteristic attributes of quantum theory such as complementarity,
entanglement or Heisenberg uncertainty relations are also attributes of the
generalized wave pattern recognition theory.

functions of the films deposited in different conditions are different on the
level that cannot be ignored in high precision prediction of the force. It is
argued that the precise values of the Drude parameters are crucial for accurate
evaluation of the force. The dielectric function of perfect single crystalline
gold is discussed. It is used to establish the upper limit on the absolute

than that between bulk samples mainly due to the presence of voids and electron
scattering on the grain boundaries in the films. The minimal reduction of the
force is estimated as 2% for the smallest separations investigated in the most
precise experiments. The other sample effects can reduce the force further but
the correction is expected to be smaller than 1%.

  Interferometer</title><description>  We present a split-beam neutron interferometric experiment to test the
non-cyclic geometric phase tied to the spatial evolution of the system: the
subjacent two-dimensional Hilbert space is spanned by the two possible paths in
the interferometer and the evolution of the state is controlled by phase
shifters and absorbers. A related experiment was reported previously by
Hasegawa et al. [Phys. Rev. A 53, 2486 (1996)] to verify the cyclic spatial
geometric phase. The interpretation of this experiment, namely to ascribe a
geometric phase to this particular state evolution, has met severe criticism
from Wagh [Phys. Rev. A 59, 1715 (1999)]. The extension to a non-cyclic
evolution manifests the correctness of the interpretation of the previous
experiment by means of an explicit calculation of the non-cyclic geometric
phase in terms of paths on the Bloch-sphere.

the cavity mode and the atomic transition frequencies is present) is written.
The generalization from the resonant case is far from being direct. Interesting
effects of the mazer physics are pointed out. In particular, it is shown that
the cavity may slow down or speed up the atoms according to the sign of the
detuning and that the induced emission process may be completely blocked by use
of a positive detuning. It is also shown that the detuning adds a potential
step effect not present at resonance and that the use of positive detunings
defines a well-controlled cooling mechanism. In the special case of a mesa
cavity mode function, generalized expressions for the reflection and
transmission coefficients have been obtained. The general properties of the
induced emission probability are finally discussed in the hot, intermediate and

process involving a system and an apparatus as a measurement, it is necessary
that the apparatus is macroscopic. This implies to treat it with quantum
statistical mechanics. The relevant time scales of the process are exhibited.
It begins with a very rapid disappearance of the off-diagonal blocks of the
overall density matrix of the tested system and the apparatus. Possible
recurrences are hindered by the large size of the latter. On a much larger time
scale the apparatus registers the outcome: Correlations are established between
the final values of the pointer and the initial diagonal blocks of the density

Baltag's analytic non-wellfounded set theory, a modal logic interpretation of
Dempster-Shafer theory, and results from the theory of isometric embeddings of

2log_2 d classical bits by sending a d-dimensional quantum state with a certain

related to the success probability of distinguishing non-orthogonal states. The
optimal average success probabilities are explicitly calculated. We consider
the possibility of sending 2 log_2 d classical bits with a shared resource of a
higher dimensional entangled state (D X D, D &gt; d). It is found that more

exponential decrease of error probabilities in the limit N \to \infty. Finally

its interpretation. In particular, an experiment cannot distinguish between the
Copenhagen interpretation (involving no hidden variables) and the de
Broglie-Bohm interpretation based on nonlocal hidden variables. Quantum
cryptographic protocols, such as BB84 or E91, are secure and mutually
equivalent as long as one works within the framework of Copenhagen
interpretation. But they are inequivalent and insecure if one considers attacks
allowed by the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation. The fundametal problem of
quantum cryptography is therefore this: Are all the statements about security
of quantum protocols based on our belief in one of the two allowed
interpretations of quantum mechanics? We show that this is not the case.
Ekert-type protocols can be modified in a way that makes them secure even if
the de Broglie-Bohm nonlocal hidden variables exist. Bennett-Brassard-type
cryptography does not seem to allow for such a correction.

subspaces of multiple physical levels. The need for this multilevel encoding
arises naturally in situations where the speed of quantum operations exceeds
the limits imposed by the addressability of individual energy levels of the
qubit physical system. A basic feature of the multilevel encoding formalism is
the logical equivalence of different physical states and correspondingly, of
different physical transformations. This logical equivalence is a source of a
significant flexibility in designing logical operations, while the multilevel
structure inherently accommodates fast and intense broadband controls thereby
facilitating faster quantum operations. Another important practical advantage
of multilevel encoding is the ability to maintain full quantum-computational
fidelity in the presence of mixing and decoherence within encoding subspaces.
The formalism is developed in detail for single-qubit operations and
generalized for multiple qubits. As an illustrative example, we perform a
simulation of closed-loop optimal control of single-qubit operations for a
model multilevel system, and subsequently apply these operations at finite
temperatures to investigate the effect of decoherence on operational fidelity.

multipartite quantum system play fundamental roles in the evolution of such
systems, and yield vital insights into the design of protocols for the quantum
control of ensembles with potential applications in the field of quantum
computing. We show how this entanglement sharing behavior may be studied in
increasingly complex systems of both theoretical and experimental significance
and demonstrate that entanglement sharing, as well as other unique features of
entanglement, e.g. the fact that maximal information about a multipartite
quantum system does not necessarily entail maximal information about its
component subsystems, may be understood as specific consequences of the
phenomenon of complementarity extended to composite quantum systems. We also
present a local hidden-variable model supplemented by an efficient amount of
classical communication that reproduces the quantum-mechanical predictions for
the entire class of Gottesman-Knill circuits. The success of our simulation
provides strong evidence that the power of quantum computation arises not
directly from entanglement, but rather from the nonexistence of an efficient,
local realistic description of the computation, even when augmented by an
efficient amount of nonlocal, but classical communication. Finally, we note
that the findings presented in this thesis support the conjecture that Hilbert
space dimension is an objective property of a quantum system since it
constrains the number of valid conceptual divisions of the system into
subsystems.

information theory for the foundations of quantum mechanics.
  In Part 1, the logical and conceptual status of various notions of
information is assessed. It is emphasized that the everyday notion of
information is to be firmly distinguished from the technical notions arising in
information theory; however it is maintained that in both settings
`information' functions as an abstract noun, hence does not refer to a
particular or substance (the worth of this point is illustrated in application
to quantum teleportation). The claim that `Information is Physical' is assessed
and argued to face a destructive dilemma. Accordingly, the slogan may not be
understood as an ontological claim, but at best, as a methodological one. The
reflections of Bruckner and Zeilinger (2001) and Deutsch and Hayden (2000) on
the nature of information in quantum mechanics are critically assessed and some
results presented on the characterization of entanglement in the Deutsch-Hayden
formalism. Some philosophical aspects of quantum computation are discussed and
general morals drawn concerning the nature of quantum information theory.
  In Part II, following some preliminary remarks, two particular
information-theoretic approaches to the foundations of quantum mechanics are
assessed in detail. It is argued that Zeilinger's (1999) Foundational Principle
is unsuccessful as a foundational principle for quantum mechanics. The
information-theoretic characterization theorem of Clifton, Bub and Halvorson
(2003) is assessed more favourably, but the generality of the approach is
questioned and it is argued that the implications of the theorem for the
traditional foundational problems in quantum mechanics remains obscure.

resonance. The fermionic three-body problem is universal and characterized by
two atom-dimer scattering lengths, $a_{ad}$ and $b_{ad}$. In the tightly bound
`dimer limit', $a_\perp/a\to\infty$, we find $b_{ad}=0$, and $a_{ad}$ is linked
to the 3D atom-dimer scattering length. In the weakly bound `BCS limit',
$a_\perp/a\to-\infty$, a connection to the Bethe Ansatz is established, which
allows for exact results. The full crossover is obtained numerically. The
bosonic three-body problem, however, is non-universal: $a_{ad}$ and $b_{ad}$
depend both on $a_\perp/a$ and on a parameter $R^*$ related to the sharpness of
the resonance. Scattering solutions are qualitatively similar to fermionic
ones. We predict the existence of a single confinement-induced three-body bound
state (trimer) for bosons.

is shown to provide a robust and controlled way of distilling, transporting and
detecting spin entanglement, as well as of measuring the rate of spin
disentanglement. Employing tunable interdot coupling the scheme creates, from
an unentangled two-electron state, a superposition of spatially separated
singlet and triplet states. A single measurement of a dot population (charge)
collapses the wave function to either of these states, realizing entanglement
to charge conversion. The scheme is robust, with the efficiency close to 100%,
for a large range of realistic spectral parameters.

universal resources for measurement-only quantum computation. We focus in this
paper on the complexity of graph state preparation. We consider the number of
ancillary qubits, the size of the primitive operators, and the duration of
preparation. For each lexicographic order over these parameters we give upper
and lower bounds for the complexity of graph state preparation. The first part
motivates our work and introduces basic notions and notations for the study of

characterizing their minimal degree by local unitary transformations, we
propose an algorithm to reduce the degree of a graph state, and show the
relationship with Sutner sigma-game.
  These properties are used in the last part, where algorithms and lower bounds

an arbitrary unitary matrix into a sequence of elementary operations (SEO).
Suppose $U_{in}$ is an $\nb$-bit unstructured unitary matrix (a unitary matrix
with no special symmetries) that we wish to compile. For $\nb&gt;10$, expressing
$U_{in}$ as a SEO requires more than a million CNOTs. This calls for a method
for finding a unitary matrix that: (1)approximates $U_{in}$ well, and (2) is
expressible with fewer CNOTs than $U_{in}$. The purpose of this paper is to
propose one such approximation method. Various quantum compiling algorithms
have been proposed in the literature that decompose an arbitrary unitary matrix
into a sequence of U(2)-multiplexors, each of which is then decomposed into a
SEO. Our strategy for approximating $U_{in}$ is to approximate these
intermediate U(2)-multiplexors. In this paper, we will show how one can
approximate a U(2)-multiplexor by another U(2)-multiplexor that is expressible
with fewer CNOTs.

  Manifolds</title><description>  We examine the conditions needed to accomplish stimulated Raman adiabatic
passage (STIRAP) when the three levels (g, e and f) are degenerate, with
arbitrary couplings contributing to the pump-pulse interaction (g - e) and to
the Stokes-pulse interaction (e-f). We show that in general a sufficient
condition for complete population removal from the g set of degenerate states
for arbitrary, pure or mixed, initial state is that the degeneracies should not
decrease along the sequence g, e and f. We show that when this condition holds
it is possible to achieve the degenerate counterpart of conventional STIRAP,
whereby adiabatic passage produces complete population transfer. Indeed, the
system is equivalent to a set of independent three-state systems, in each of
which a STIRAP procedure can be implemented. We describe a scheme of unitary
transformations that produces this result. We also examine the cases when this
degeneracy constraint does not hold, and show what can be accomplished in those
cases. For example, for angular momentum states when the degeneracy of the g
and f levels is less than that of the e level we show how a special choice for
the pulse polarizations and phases can produce complete removal of population
from the g set. Our scheme can be a powerful tool for coherent control in
degenerate systems, because of its robustness when selective addressing of the
states is not required or impossible. We illustrate the analysis with several
analytically solvable examples, in which the degeneracies originate from
angular momentum orientation, as expressed by magnetic sublevels.

product state for a particular value and orientation of the field, at which the
purely quantum correlations due to entanglement disappear. Analytical
expressions for the energy and the form of such states are given, and a novel
type of exactly solvable two-dimensional quantum models is therefore singled
out. Moreover, we show that the field-induced quantum phase transition present
in the models is unambiguously characterized by a cusp minimum in the
pairwise-to-global entanglement ratio R, marking the quantum-critical
enhancement of \emph{multipartite} entanglement. A detailed discussion is
provided on the universality of the cusp in R as a signature of quantum
critical behavior entirely based on entanglement.

about their direction can be obtained from a pair of anti-parallel spins
compared to a pair of parallel spins, where the first member of the pair (which
we call the pointer member) can point equally along any direction in the Bloch
sphere. They argued that this was due to the difference in dimensionality
spanned by these two alphabets of states. Here we consider similar alphabets,
but with the first spin restricted to a fixed small circle of the Bloch sphere.
In this case, the dimensionality spanned by the anti-parallel versus parallel
alphabet is now equal. However, the anti-parallel alphabet is found to still
contain more information in general. We generalize this to having N parallel
spins and M anti-parallel spins. When the pointer member is restricted to a
small circle these alphabets again span spaces of equal dimension, yet in
general, more directional information can be found for sets with smaller |N-M|
for any fixed total number of spins. We find that the optimal POVMs for
extracting directional information in these cases can always be expressed in
terms of the Fourier basis. Our results show that dimensionality alone cannot
explain the greater information content in anti-parallel combinations of spins
compared to parallel combinations. In addition, we describe an LOCC protocol
which extract optimal directional information when the pointer member is
restricted to a small circle and a pair of parallel spins are supplied.

anomalous narrowing of the coincidence wave packets and, under different

Fundamental symmetry relations between the photon and atom single-particle and

method of Beane \textit{et al.} does not include explicitly any new scale in

suggest tantalizing connections to quantum optics. Several of these experiments
address the prototypical problem of cavity quantum electrodynamics: a two-level
system coupled to a quantum harmonic oscillator. Such devices may allow the
exploration of parameter regimes outside the near-resonance and weak-coupling
assumptions of the ubiquitous rotating-wave approximation (RWA), necessitating
other theoretical approaches. One such approach is an adiabatic approximation
in the limit that the oscillator frequency is much larger than the
characteristic frequency of the two-level system. A derivation of the
approximation is presented and the time evolution of the two-level-system
occupation probability is calculated using both thermal- and coherent-state
initial conditions for the oscillator. Closed-form evaluation of the time
evolution in the weak-coupling limit provides insight into the differences
between the thermal- and coherent-state models. Finally, potential experimental
observations in solid-state systems, particularly the Cooper-pair
box--nanomechanical resonator system, are discussed and found to be promising.

responsible for the interaction of polarization and orbital properties of
electromagnetic waves (spin-orbit interaction of photons), results in fine
splitting of the levels of scalar approximation. The basic features of this
fine structure of the levels are similar to that of electron levels in an atom.
Namely: 1) sublevels of the fine structure are defined by an additional quantum
number: product of helicity of the wave and its orbital moment; 2) for a
waveguide with a parabolic profile of the refractive index each level of the
scalar approximation splits into N sublevels (N is the principal quantum
number), while for any other profile it splits into 2 sublevels; 3) each level
of the fine structure remains twice degenerated due to local axial symmetry of
the waveguide. Numerical estimations show that the described fine splitting of

reproduce quantum algorithms, including Grover's algorithm. In this paper, we
show that quantum search algorithm by adiabatic evolution has two properties
that conventional quantum search algorithm doesn't have. Firstly, we show that
in the initial state of the algorithm only the amplitude of the basis state
corresponding to the solution affects the running time of the algorithm, while
other amplitudes do not. Using this property, if we know a priori probability
about the location of the solution before search, we can modify the adiabatic
evolution to make the algorithm faster. Secondly, we show that by a factor for
the initial and finial Hamiltonians we can reduce the running time of the
algorithm arbitrarily. Especially, we can reduce the running time of adiabatic
search algorithm to a constant time independent of the size of the database.
The second property can be extended to other adiabatic algorithms.

the extended Hubbard model with nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions. The
nearest Coulomb interactions stabilize electronic states with the opposite
electric charges separated and localized along both edges. Such states are
analogous as nanocondensers. Therefore, electric capacitance, defined using a
relation of polarizability, is calculated to examine nano functionalities. We
find that the behavior of the capacitance is widely different depending on
whether the system is in the magnetic or charge polarized phases. In the
magnetic phase, the capacitance is dominated by the presence of the edge states
while the ribbon width is small. As the ribbon becomes wider, the capacitance
remains with large magnitudes as the system develops into metallic zigzag
nanotubes. It is proportional to the inverse of the width, when the system
corresponds to the semiconducting nanotubes and the system is in the charge
polarized phase also. The latter behavior could be understood by the presence
of an energy gap for charge excitations.

both the forward and backward directions.
  Each communication capacity can be thought of as a tradeoff between the
achievable rates of specific types of forward and backward communication.
  Our first result shows that for any bipartite unitary gate, coherent
classical communication is no more difficult than classical communication --
they have the same achievable rate regions. Previously this result was known
only for the unidirectional capacities (i.e., the boundaries of the tradeoff).
  We then relate the tradeoff curve for two-way coherent communication to the
tradeoff for two-way quantum communication and the tradeoff for coherent
communiation in one direction and quantum communication in the other.

situations when measurement statistics is insufficient to determine consistent
probability distributions. As a consequence either the estimation
(reconstruction) of the channel completely fails or it results in an unphysical
channel (i.e., the corresponding map is not completely positive). We present a
regularization procedure that allows us to derive physically reasonable

continuous-variable quantum entanglement: The common probability distribution
of the two coordinates and the corresponding coarse-grained velocities cannot
be prepared via mixing of any factorized distributions referring to the two
particles in separate. This is possible for particles which interacted in the
past, but do not interact in the present. Three factors are crucial for the
effect: 1) separation of time-scales of coordinate and momentum which motivates
the definition of coarse-grained velocities; 2) the resulting uncertainty
relations between the coordinate of the brownian particle and the change of its
coarse-grained velocity; 3) the fact that the coarse-grained velocity, though
pertaining to a single brownian particle, is defined on a common context of two
particles. The brownian entanglement is a consequence of a coarse-grained
description and disappears for a finer resolution of the brownian motion. We
discuss possibilities of its experimental realizations in examples of
macroscopic brownian motion.

that are accelerated through a single-mode microwave cavity. We show that
taking into account of the ''counter-rotating'' terms in the interaction
Hamiltonian leads to the excitation of an atom with simultaneous emission of a
photon into a field mode. In the case of a slow switching on of the
interaction, the ratio of emission and absorption probabilities is
exponentially small and is described by the Unruh factor. In the opposite case
of sharp cavity boundaries the above ratio is much greater and radiation is
produced with an intensity which can exceed the intensity of Unruh acceleration
radiation in free space by many orders of magnitude. In both cases real photons
are produced, contrary to the opinion that a uniformly accelerated atom does
not radiate. The cavity field at steady state is described by a thermal density
matrix. However, under some conditions laser gain is possible. We present a
detailed discussion of how the acceleration of atoms affects the generated
cavity field in different situations, progressing from a simple physical
picture of Unruh radiation to more complicated situations.

in which it is often obvious that feats achievable by use of quantum
entanglement would be classically impossible. A two-player pseudo-telepathy
game proceeds as follows: Alice and Bob are individually asked a question and
they must provide an answer. They are not allowed any form of communication
once the questions are asked, but they may have agreed on a common strategy
prior to the execution of the game. We say that they win the game if the
questions and answers fulfil a specific relation. A game exhibits
pseudo-telepathy if there is a quantum strategy that makes Alice and Bob win
the game for all possible questions, provided they share prior entanglement,
whereas it would be impossible to win this game systematically in a classical
setting. In this paper, we show that any two-player pseudo-telepathy game
requires the quantum players to share an entangled quantum system of dimension
at least 3x3. This is optimal for two-player games, but the most efficient
pseudo-telepathy game possible, in terms of total dimension, involves three
players who share a quantum system of dimension 2x2x2.

we confirm these predictions by observing the evolution of the momentum

density operator of an active atom which is coupled to radiation (Bloch part)
and which interacts collisionally with the perturber gas (Boltzmann part). The
standard approach to the collisional part is well-known from the literature. It
preserves hermiticity and normalization, but the question whether it preserves
positivity seems to remain open. The completely positive BBE were recently
derived via the general master equation techniques. These two approaches are
applied for a model of n-level nondegenerate atom. We show that within this
model both approaches to the collisional part of BBE are equivalent -- give the
same physical predictions. The approach based upon master equation techniques
guarantees the preservation of hermiticity, normalization and positivity. The
proven equivalence ascertains that the standard approach also preserves
positivity. Moreover, some aspects of the standard derivation (which atomic
states do contribute to the evolution) are clarified by the established
equivalence.

time evolution has been derived from the unitarity of standard quantum
formalism. New wave functions of free and non-free quantum systems follow from
Schroedinger equation after inserting an ansatz. Quantum systems show up as
probability waves before measurement. A pure entangled state of a composite
system evolves non-unitarily, only to disentangle itself into a definite state
after reduction at the measurement point. A classical space-time point is
created momentarily in this event. Unitarity is restored at that point. The
non-Hermitian observables defined in the domain of rigged Hilbert space
transform into Hermitian ones at the measurement point. The problem of
preferred basis is resolved by the requirement of specifying the position of
measurement point. Two theorems prove that time is a non-Hermitian operator,
thus placing space and time on an equal footing. Bound states are found to need
discrete space-time, which supports its use in loop quantum gravity.
Non-unitarity in the theory helps buttress the no-boundary proposal; and
uncertainty relation makes a leeway to singularity-free Quantum Cosmology.
Quantum Mechanics also accommodates complex and negative probabilities.

involves testing the characteristic cos^2(theta) modulation of photon
transmission through a pair of polarisers at relative angle theta (Malus' law).
For single photons, Malus' law is a remarkable feature of quantum theory: it is
equivalent to expectation additivity for incompatible observables, and is
generically violated for hidden-variables theories with nonstandard probability
distributions. An experiment with entangled states straddling an event horizon
is motivated by the Hawking information loss puzzle, as well as on general
grounds. In principle, one could test the currently observed X-ray photons in

  entanglement</title><description>  We show that the classification of bi-partite pure entangled states when
local quantum operations are restricted yields a structure that is analogous in
many respects to that of mixed-state entanglement. Specifically, we develop
this analogy by restricting operations through local superselection rules, and
show that such exotic phenomena as bound entanglement and activation arise
using pure states in this setting. This analogy aids in resolving several
conceptual puzzles in the study of entanglement under restricted operations. In
particular, we demonstrate that several types of quantum optical states that
possess confusing entanglement properties are analogous to bound entangled
states. Also, the classification of pure-state entanglement under restricted
operations can be much simpler than for mixed-state entanglement. For instance,
in the case of local Abelian superselection rules all questions concerning
distillability can be resolved.

of the Schrodinger equation is unclear: Conventional measures fail to detect
chaos in such systems. However, when quantum systems are subjected to
observation -- as all experimental systems must be -- their dynamics is no
longer linear and, in the appropriate limit(s), the evolution of expectation
values, conditioned on the observations, closely approaches the behavior of
classical trajectories. Here we show, by analyzing a specific example, that
microscopic continuously observed quantum systems, even far from any classical
limit, can have a positive Lyapunov exponent, and thus be truly chaotic.

Analogously to the classical case, the exponential separating rate is equal to

properties. No matter how quanta are detected, they always express the local
net state of the corresponding wave-function. The mechanism behind this process
is still a mystery. However, quantum wave-functions evolve like classical
waves. If they determine all the observations, why do they entail &quot;weird&quot;
phenomena? In particular, why do they produce conceptual problems, such as the
EPR paradox? It turns out that all the major interpretations in quantum
mechanics are particle-based ontologies. Variables of fundamental interest,
such as momentum and position, are assumed to reflect the input states of
discrete entities, even when their evolution is predicted by wave equations.
Here I show that a whole class of microscopic phenomena, including
entanglement, can be interpreted without contradictions if the variables of
quantum mechanics are actually treated as wave properties. The main
recommendation is to assume that sharp spectral states are transient outcomes
of superposition, rather than permanent input components.

system of $N$ spin 1/2 particles interacting via a collective spin-spin
coupling described by the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) Hamiltonian. Under certain
conditions which includes the special case of a super-symmetry, the ground
state can be constructed analytically. In the case of an anti-ferromagnetic
coupling and for an even number of particles this state undergoes a smooth
crossover as a function of the continuous anisotropy parameter $\gamma $ from a
separable ($\gamma =\infty $) to a maximally entangled many-particle state
($\gamma =0$). From the analytic expression for the ground state, bipartite and
global entanglement are calculated. In the thermodynamic limit a discontinuous
change of the scaling behavior of the bipartite entanglement is found at the
isotropy point $\gamma =0$. For $% \gamma =0$ the entanglement grows
logarithmically with the system size with no upper bound, for $\gamma \neq 0$
it saturates at a level only depending on $\gamma $. For finite systems with

states, such as those represented by the W-state and the GHZ-state. Our main
contribution is a demonstration of the special computational power of these

deformed oscillator algebra has been an outstanding issue. This original
concept introduced long ago by Greenberg is the motivation for this
investigation. We establish that a q-deformed algebra can be used to describe
the statistics of particles (anyons) interpolating continuously between Bose
and Fermi statistics, i.e., fractional statistics. We show that the generalized
intermediate statistics splits into the Boson-like and Fermion-like regimes,
each described by a unique oscillator algebra. The B-anyon thermostatistics is
described by employing the q-calculus based on the Jackson derivative but the
F-anyons are described by ordinary derivatives of thermodynamics. Thermodynamic
functions of both B-anyons and F-anyons are determined and examined.

 4-level atoms. An integral part of the four-wave mixing process is a
collective instability which spontaneously generates a periodic density
modulation in the cold atomic sample with a period equal to half of the
wavelength of the generated high-frequency optical field. Due to the generation
of this density modulation, phase-matching between the pump and scattered
fields is not a necessary initial condition for this wave-mixing process to
occur, rather the density modulation acts to &quot;self phase-match&quot; the fields
during the course of the wave-mixing process. We describe a one-dimensional
model of this process, and suggest a proof-of-principle experiment which would
involve pumping a sample of cold Cs atoms with three infra-red pump fields to
produce blue light.

of an ion trap qubit serving as the information storage and a solid-state
charge qubit serving as the quantum processor, connected by a superconducting
cavity. In this paper, we extend our previous work [1] and study the
decoherence, coupling and scalability of the hybrid system. We present our
calculations of the decoherence of the coupled ion - charge system due to the
charge fluctuations in the solid-state system and the dissipation of the
superconducting cavity under laser radiation. A gate scheme that exploits rapid
state flips of the charge qubit to reduce decoherence by the charge noise is
designed. We also study a superconducting switch that is inserted between the
cavity and the charge qubit and provides tunable coupling between the qubits.
The scalability of the hybrid scheme is discussed together with several

  transpose preserving operations</title><description>  We consider the transformation of multi-partite states in the single copy
setting under positive-partial-transpose-preserving operations (PPT-operations)
and obtain both qualitative and quantitative results. Firstly, for some pure
state transformations that are impossible under local operations and classical
communication (LOCC), we demonstrate that they become possible with a
surprisingly large success probability under PPT-operations. Furthermore, we
clarify the convertibility of arbitrary multipartite pure states under
PPT-operations, and show that a drastic simplification in the classification of
pure state entanglement occurs when the set of operations is switched from LOCC
to PPT-operations. Indeed, the infinitely many types of LOCC-incomparable
entanglement are reduced to only one type under the action of PPT-operations.
This is a clear manifestation of the increased power afforded by the use of
PPT-bound entanglement. In addition, we further enlarge the set of operations
to clarify the effect of another type of bound entanglement, multipartite
unlockable bound entanglement, and show that a further simplification occurs.
As compared to pure states a more complicated situation emerges in the mixed
state settings. While single copy distillation becomes possible under
PPT-operations for some mixed states it remains impossible for other mixed
states.

the acceptance of his approach to quantum mechanics over de Broglie's had no
reasonable foundation. But Bohr's interpretation changed little from the time
of its first appearance, and stood independent of any philosophical

conjecture of unusually wide scope, on the nature and future course of
explanations in the sciences (and not only the physical sciences). If it must

kinds of probability, and the relationship between them. The fundamental theory
of objective probability is quantum mechanics: it is argued that neither Bohr's
Copenhagen interpretation, nor the pilot-wave theory, nor stochastic
state-reduction theories, give a satisfactory answer to the question of what
objective probabilities are in quantum mechanics, or why they should satisfy
the Born rule; nor do they give any reason why subjective probabilities should
track objective ones.
  But it is shown that if probability only arises with decoherence, then they
must be given by the Born rule. That further, on the Everett interpretation, we
have a clear statement of what probabilities are, in terms of purely
categorical physical properties; and finally, along lines recently laid out by
Deutsch and Wallace, that there is a clear basis in the axioms of decision
theory as to why subjective probabilities should track these objective ones.
  These results hinge critically on the absence of hidden-variables or any
other mechanism (such as state-reduction) from the physical interpretation of
the theory.
  The account of probability has traditionally been considered the principal
weakness of the Everett interpretation; on the contrary it emerges as one of
its principal strengths.

many particle system can be simulated on a classical computer with the
polynomial time and memory cost. Algorithms play the central role here but not
the analysis, and a simulation gives a &quot;film&quot; which visualizes many particle
quantum dynamics and is demonstrated to a user of the model. Restrictions
following from the algorithm theory are considered on a level of fundamental
physical laws. Born rule for the calculation of quantum probability as well as
the decoherence is derived from the existence of a nonzero minimal value of
amplitude module - a grain of amplitude. The limitation on the classical
computational resources gives the unified description of quantum dynamics that
is not divided to the unitary dynamics and measurements and does not depend on
the existence of observer. It is proposed the description of states based on
the nesting of particles in each other that permits to account the effects of
all levels in the same model. Algorithmic approach admits the possibility of

all uniform superpositions, can be realized economically only in dimension d=2.
The used ansatz is supported by numerical evidence up to d=7. An economical

pair potential by separating the Schr\&quot;odinger equation following the classic
work of Calogero, but allowing all possible self-adjoint boundary conditions
for the angular and radial Hamiltonians. The inverse square coupling constant
is taken to be $g=2\nu (\nu-1)$ with ${1/2} &lt;\nu&lt; {3/2}$ and then the angular
Hamiltonian is shown to admit a 2-parameter family of inequivalent
quantizations compatible with the dihedral $D_6$ symmetry of its potential term
$9 \nu (\nu -1)/\sin^2 3\phi$. These are parametrized by a matrix $U\in U(2)$
satisfying $\sigma_1 U \sigma_1 = U$, and in all cases we describe the
qualitative features of the angular eigenvalues and classify the eigenstates
under the $D_6$ symmetry and its $S_3$ subgroup generated by the particle
exchanges. The angular eigenvalue $\lambda$ enters the radial Hamiltonian
through the potential $(\lambda -{1/4})/r^2$ allowing a 1-parameter family of
self-adjoint boundary conditions at $r=0$ if $\lambda &lt;1$. For $0&lt;\lambda&lt;1$
our analysis of the radial Schr\&quot;odinger equation is consistent with previous
results on the possible energy spectra, while for $\lambda &lt;0$ it shows that
the energy is not bounded from below rejecting those $U$'s admitting such
eigenvalues as physically impermissible. The permissible self-adjoint angular
Hamiltonians include, for example, the cases $U=\pm {\bf 1}_2, \pm \sigma_1$,
which are explicitly solvable and are presented in detail. The choice $U=-{\bf
1}_2$ reproduces Calogero's quantization, while for the choice $U=\sigma_1$ the
system is smoothly connected to the harmonic oscillator in the limit $\nu \to

magnetic resonance microscopy lens where potentially only a single spin located
in the focus spot of the structure is resonant. Despite the presence of other
spins in the Angstrom-scale vicinity of the resonant spin, the high gradient
magnetic field of the lens renders those spins inactive in the detection
process.

  interferometry</title><description>  The time-development of photoexcitations in molecular aggregates exhibits
specific dynamics of electronic states and vibrational wavefunction. We discuss
the dynamical formation of entanglement between electronic and vibrational
degrees of freedom in molecular aggregates with theory of electronic energy
transfer and the method of vibronic 2D wavepackets [Cina, Kilin, Humble, J.
Chem. Phys. 118, 46 (2003)]. The vibronic dynamics is also described by
applying Jaynes-Cummings model to the electronic energy transfer [Kilin,
Pereverzev, Prezhdo, J. Chem. Phys. 120, 11209 (2004);math-ph/0403023].
Following the ultrafast excitation of donor[chem-ph/9411004] the population of
acceptor rises by small portions per each vibrational period, oscillates force
and back between donor and acceptor with later damping and partial revivals of
this oscillation. The transfer rate gets larger as donor wavepacket approaches
the acceptor equilibrium configuration, which is possible at specific energy
differences of donor and acceptor and at maximal amount of the vibrational
motion along the line that links donor and acceptor equilibria positions. The
four-pulse phase-locked nonlinear wavepacket 2D interferograms reflect the
shape of the relevant 2D vibronic wavepackets and have maxima at longer delay
between excitation pulses for dimers with equal donor-acceptor energy
difference compare to dimers with activationless energy configuration [Cina,
Fleming, J. Phys. Chem. A. 108, 11196 (2004)].

that are not completely positive based on local orthogonal observables. As
applications the entanglement witness of the $3\times 3$ bound entangled state
[P. Horodecki, Phys. Lett. A {\bf 232}, 333 (1997)] is explicitly constructed
and a family of $d$-dimensional bound entangled states is designed so that the
entanglement can be detected by permuting local orthogonal observables. Further
the proposed physically not implementable positive maps can be physically
realized by measuring a Hermitian correlation matrix of local orthogonal
observables.

entangled states of light. We consider two questions: (i) what state contains
the smallest average number of photons given a fixed amount of entanglement?
and (ii) what state is the most robust against photon absorption? We explain
why the two-mode squeezed state is the answer to the first question but not
quite to the second question.
