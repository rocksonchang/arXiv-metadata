quant-ph/9712030 we studied in detail the metastability of a Bose-Einstein
Condensate (BEC) confined in an harmonic trap with zero-range interaction. As
well known, the BEC with attractive zero-range interaction is not stable but
can be metastable. In our paper we analyzed the role of dimensionality for the
metastability of the BEC with attractive and repulsive interaction.

realistic theories. Consequently, the quantum state vector becomes a strong
candidate for providing an objective picture of reality. However, such an
ontological view of quantum theory faces difficulties when spacelike
measurements on entangled states have to be described, because time ordering of
spacelike events can change under Lorentz-Poincar\'e transformations. In the
present paper it is shown that a necessary condition for consistency is to
require state vector reduction on the backward light-cone. A fresh approach to
the quantum measurement problem appears feasible within such a framework.

potentials $V(x)=-x^4+2iax^3+(a^2-2b)x^2+2i(ab-J)x$ is introduced. Until now,
it was believed that the lowest-degree one-dimensional quasi-exactly solvable
polynomial potential is sextic. This belief is based on the assumption that the
Hamiltonian must be Hermitian. However, it has recently been discovered that
there are huge classes of non-Hermitian, ${\cal PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonians
whose spectra are real, discrete, and bounded below [physics/9712001].
Replacing Hermiticity by the weaker condition of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry allows
for new kinds of quasi-exactly solvable theories. The spectra of this family of
quartic potentials discussed here are also real, discrete, and bounded below,
and the quasi-exact portion of the spectra consists of the lowest $J$
eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are the roots of a $J$th-degree polynomial.

point symmetry group, differ by their spectrum and magnetic properties. E. g.,
properties of the odd-integer moments are different from those of the
even-integer. The effect is due to Berry's phases gained by the moment, when it
tunnels between minima of the external field. Two cases of the group $O$ are
classified, namely, 6- and 8-fold coordinations. The spectrum and degeneration
of energy levels depend on a remainder $\{J/n\}$, where the divisor $n=4$ and 3
for 6-fold and 8-fold coordination respectively. %High symmetry results in a
finite magnetic moment for half-integer %and some integer moments, for example
odd $J$ at 6-fold coordination. Large moments in the cubic environment can be

energy density at the Cauchy horizon. The interaction of these divergent
electromagnetic fields with infalling matter was recently analyzed (L. M. burko

objects within two simplified models of a classical and a quantum absorber.
These effects are found to be finite and even negligible for typical parameters
of a supermassive black hole.

systems can be related by means of time-dependent canonical transformations
(CT). The dynamical symmetry group of system with Hamiltonian H(t) coincides
with the invariance group of H(t). Quadratic Hamiltonians can be diagonalized
by means of linear time-dependent CT. The diagonalization can be explicitly
carried out in the case of stationary and some nonstationary quadratic H.
Linear CT can diagonalize the uncertainty matrix \sigma(\rho) for canonical
variables p_k, q_j in any state \rho, i.e., \sigma(\rho) is symplectically
congruent to a diagonal uncertainty matrix. For multimode squeezed canonical
coherent states (CCS) and squeezed Fock states with equal photon numbers in

the loss of generality, that the vector potential (the gauge) is a linear
function of position, i.e. it could be considered as a three-dimensional real
matrix or, more generally in an n-dimensional space, as a tensor A of the rank
two. The magnetic tensor H is obtained from A by antisymmetrization, i.e.
H=A-A^T. It is shown that the transpose of A plays a special role, since it
determines the operator of the orbit center of a charged particle moving in an
external magnetic field H. Moreover, this movement can be considered as a
combination of N&lt;=n independent cyclotronic movements in orthogonal planes
(cyclotron orbits) with quantized energies, whereas in other n-2N dimensions
the particle is completely free with a continuous energy spectrum. The proposed
approach enables introduction of the four-dimensional space-time and, after
some generalizations, non-linear gauges.

associated to a diatomic rigid molecule (heteronuclear) or to a quantum rigid
body with axial symmetry like a molecule or a nucleus. The time evolution is
understood entirely within the frame of fractional revivals discovered by
Averbukh and Perelman since the energy spectrum is exactly quadratic. Our
objectives are to study how these interference effects differ when there is a
change of the initial WP. For this purpose we introduce a two parameter set of
angular momentum coherent states. From one hand this set emerge quite naturally
from the three dimensional coherent states of the harmonic oscillator, from
another hand this set is shown to be buit from intelligent spin states.We have
also compared our coherent states to some previously constructed using boson
representation of angular momentum. The time evolution of coherent states for

equation. Since the KDP--equation which describes spin-0 and spin-1 bosons is
of Dirac-type, we examine some analogies and differences from the Dirac
equation. The main difference to the Dirac equation is that the KDP equation
contains redundant components. We will show that as a result certain
interaction terms in the Hamilton form of the KDP equation do not have a
physical meaning and will not affect the calculation of physical observables.
We point out that a second order KDP equation derived by Kemmer as an analogy
to the second order Dirac equation is of limited physical applicability as (i)
it belongs to a class of second order equations which can be derived from the
original KDP equation and (ii) it lacks a back-transformation which would allow
one to obtain solutions of the KDP equation out of solutions of the second
order equation. We therefore suggest a different higher order equation which,
as far as the solutions for the wave functions are concerned, is equivalent to
the orginal first order KDP wave equation.

  Effective Scalar Photon Interaction</title><description>  We consider a hydrogenic system with a nucleus of finite mass. The coupling

$S_q$ can differ from the usually defined entropy $S$ and $S_q$ may increase
with time for an isolated system. The essential condition for the difference
between $S$ and $S_q$ is the assumption that the set {\bf A} of observables
which can be represented by a measurement is a proper subset of the set of
selfadjoint operators. The underlying idea is made visible in the case of

states of the electron wave. The paper therefore proposes a new model of
hydrogen based on internal properties of electrons. The ground state of the

referred to elastic deformations of its nucleus, resonance levels are a result
of boundary conditions for radial electron waves and photon interactions due to
nuclear oscillations. Spectral emissions of excited atoms can be referred to a
decay of the state of motion of the coupled electron-proton system. The

analyzed are referred to material characteristics of particles involved.
Statistical effects are referred to interactions with the atomic environment,

We derive conditions based on the atomic reservoir, and atom dispersion
relations for when the Born-Markov approximations are valid and discuss

Differences between the standard optical laser model and the atom laser are due
to a combination of factors, including the parameter regimes in which a typical
atom laser would operate, the different reservoir state which is appropriate
for atoms, and the different dispersion relations between atoms and photons. We
present results based on an exact method in the regimes in which the
Born-Markov approximation fails. The exact solutions in some experimentally

calculate the quantum backaction of this measurement technique. We find that
phase-contrast imaging is not a quantum nondemolition measurement of the atomic

proportional to the light intensity and to the inverse cube of the optical wave
length. The fewer atoms are condensed the higher is the required intensity to
see a picture, and, consequently, the higher is the induced backaction. To
describe the quantum physics of phase-contrast imaging we put forward a new
approach to quantum-optical propagation. We develop an effective field theory

characterized with the help of the generating function, which we derive using
the exact statistical description of raw experimental outcomes. We use the
developed formalism to point out that the statistical uncertainty results in
substantial limitations of the determined information on the quantum state:
though a family of observables characterizing the quantum state can be safely
evaluated from experimental data, its further use to obtain the expectation
value of some operators generates exploding statistical errors. These issues
are discussed using the example of phase-insensitive measurements of a single
light mode. We study reconstruction of the photon number distribution from
photon counting and random phase homodyne detection. We show that utilization
of the reconstructed distribution to evaluate a simple well-behaved observable,
namely the parity operator, encounters difficulties due to accumulation of
statistical errors. As the parity operator yields the Wigner function at the
phase space origin, this example also demonstrates that transformation between
various experimentally determined representations of the quantum state is a
quite delicate matter.

amplifier has a 3 decibels noise figure, which is usually considered an
unsurpassable limit, referred to as the standard quantum limit (SQL). Both
noise and BER could be reduced using an ideal amplifier, which is feasible in

but noninteracting Dirac particles. Lorentz invariance is achieved for these
models through the incorporation of an additional dynamical space-time
structure provided by a foliation of space-time. These models can be regarded
as the extension of Bohm's model for N Dirac particles, corresponding to the
foliation into the equal-time hyperplanes for a distinguished Lorentz frame, to
more general foliations. As with Bohm's model, there exists for these models an
equivariant measure on the leaves of the foliation. This makes possible a
simple statistical analysis of position correlations analogous to the
equilibrium analysis for (the nonrelativistic) Bohmian mechanics.

optical frequency. When a 50-keV electron beam crossed a thin crystalline
dielectric film illuminated with laser light, electrons produced the
electron-diffraction pattern not only at a fluorescent target but also at a
nonfluorescent target. In the latter case the pattern was of the same color as
the laser light (the Schwarz-Hora effect). This effect was discussed
extensively in the early 1970s. However, since 1972 no reports on the results
of further attempts to repeat those experiments in other groups have appeared,
while the failures of the initial such attempts have been explained by Schwarz.
The analysis of the literature shows there are several unresolved up to now
contradictions between the theory and the Schwarz experiments. In this work we
consider the interpretation of the long-wavelength spatial beating of the
Schwarz-Hora radiation. A more accurate expression for the spatial period has
been obtained, taking into account the mode structure of the laser field within
the dielectric film. It is shown that the discrepancy of more than 10% between
the experimental and theoretical results for the spatial period cannot be
reduced by using the existing quantum models that consider a collimated
electron beam.

inhomogeneities in the Universe are of genuine quantum origin. On the other
hand, looking at these inhomogeneities and measuring them, clearly no specific
quantum mechanical properties are observed. We show how the transition from
their inherent quantum gravitational nature to classical behaviour comes about
-- a transition whereby none of the successful quantitative predictions of the
inflationary scenario for the present-day universe is changed. This is made
possible by two properties. First, the quantum state for the spacetime metric
perturbations produced by quantum gravitational effects in the early Universe
becomes very special (highly squeezed) as a result of the expansion of the
Universe (as long as the wavelength of the perturbations exceeds the Hubble
radius). Second, decoherence through the environment distinguishes the field
amplitude basis as being the pointer basis. This renders the perturbations
presently indistinguishable from stochastic classical inhomogeneities.

there exists, in general, a difference between the energy functional defined
within the Lagrangian formulation as an appropriate conserved component of the
canonical energy-momentum tensor and the energy functional defined as the
expectation value of the corresponding nonlinear Hamiltonian operator. Some
examples of such ambiguity are presented for a particularly simple model and
some known modifications. However, we point out that there exist a class of
nonlinear modifications of the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation where this difference
does not occur, which makes them more consistent in a manner similar to that of
the linear Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation. It is found that necessary but not
sufficient a condition for such modifications is the homogeneity of the
modified Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation or its underlying Lagrangian density which is
assumed to be ``bilinear'' in the wave function in some rather general sense.
Yet, it is only for a particular form of this density that the ambiguity in
question does not arise. A salient feature of this form is the presence of
phase functionals. The present paper thus introduces a new class of
modifications characterized by this desirable and rare property.

allows us to study arbitrary deformations in space and time of the perfectly
reflecting (conducting) boundaries of a cavity. The mechanical response of the
intervening vacuum is calculated to linear order in the frequency-wavevector
plane, using which a plethora of interesting phenomena can be studied. For a
single corrugated plate we find a correction to mass at low frequencies, and an
effective shear viscosity at high frequencies that are both anisotropic. The
anisotropy is set by the wavevector of the corrugation. For two plates, the
mass renormalization is modified by a function of the ratio between the
separation of the plates and the wave-length of corrugations. The dissipation
rate is not modified for frequencies below the lowest optical mode of the
cavity, and there is a resonant dissipation for all frequencies greater than
that. In this regime, a divergence in the response function implies that such
high frequency deformation modes of the cavity can not be excited by any
macroscopic external forces. This phenomenon is intimately related to resonant
particle creation. For particular examples of two corrugated plates that are
stationary, or moving uniformly in the lateral directions, Josephson-like
effects are observed. For capillary waves on the surface of mercury a
renormalization to surface tension, and sound velocity is obtained.

probability for individual random trials without repetition is considered. A
sequence of such trials, namely quantum jumps, is realized in indeterministic
dynamics of the universe. A hidden selector for the quantum jumps is
constructed.

are described. They are applied to a quantum key distribution protocol proposed
by Bennett and Brassard in 1984. The proof considers a practical variation on
the protocol in which the channel is noisy and photons may be lost during the
transmission. The initial coding into the channel must be perfect (i.e.,
exactly as described in the protocol). No restriction is imposed on the
detector used at the receiving side of the channel, except that whether or not
the received system is detected must be independent of the basis used to
measure this system.

observables with uncertainty free states and show that the inequality is
violated in quantum mechanics for EPR and GHZ states. If the uncertainties are
allowed in local observables then the statistical predictions of hidden
variable theory is well respected in quantum world. We argue that the
uncertainties play a key role in understanding the non-locality issues in
quantum world. Thus we can not rule out the possibility that a local, realistic
hidden variable theory with statistical uncertainties in the observables might
reproduce all the results of quantum theory.

  Representation of Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  In the probability representation of quantum mechanics, quantum states are
represented by a classical probability distribution, the marginal distribution
function (MDF), whose time dependence is governed by a classical evolution
equation. We find and explicitly solve, for a wide class of Hamiltonians, new
equations for the Green's function of such an equation, the so-called classical
propagator. We elucidate the connection of the classical propagator to the
quantum propagator for the density matrix and to the Green's function of the
Schr\&quot;odinger equation. Within the new description of quantum mechanics we give
a definition of coherence solely in terms of properties of the MDF and we test
the new definition recovering well known results. As an application, the forced
parametric oscillator is considered . Its classical and quantum propagator are
found, together with the MDF for coherent and Fock states.

We suggest a situation where the cloning transformations are restricted,

system made of two subsystems: if the subsystems are only available one after
the other then there are various cases when orthogonal states cannot be cloned.
Surprising examples are given, which give a radically better insight regarding

paraxial approximation, the real space solution to the scattering problem of a

black-box quantum algorithm (a la Grover's database search algorithm) to a
quantum communication protocol for a related problem, in a way that fully
exploits the quantum parallelism. This allows us to obtain new positive and
negative results. The positive results are novel quantum communication
protocols that are built from nontrivial quantum algorithms via this
simulation. These protocols, combined with (old and new) classical lower
bounds, are shown to provide the first asymptotic separation results between
the quantum and classical (probabilistic) two-party communication complexity
models. In particular, we obtain a quadratic separation for the bounded-error
model, and an exponential separation for the zero-error model. The negative
results transform known quantum communication lower bounds to computational
lower bounds in the black-box model. In particular, we show that the quadratic
speed-up achieved by Grover for the OR function is impossible for the PARITY
function or the MAJORITY function in the bounded-error model, nor is it
possible for the OR function itself in the exact case. This dichotomy naturally
suggests a study of bounded-depth predicates (i.e. those in the polynomial
hierarchy) between OR and MAJORITY. We present black-box algorithms that
achieve near quadratic speed up for all such predicates.

exactly with O(T^6) queries.
  We also give asymptotically tight characterizations of T for all symmetric f

nonlinear evolution of a state of a quantum computer. They have explicitly used
the fact that nonlinear evolutions in Hilbert spaces do not conserve scalar
products of states, and applied a description of separated systems taken from
Weinberg's nonlinear quantum mechanics. On the other hand it is known that
violation of orthogonality combined with the Weinberg-type description
generates unphysical, arbitrarily fast influences between noninteracting
systems. It was not therefore clear whether the algorithm is fast because
arbitrarily fast unphysical effects are involved. In these notes I show that
this is not the case. I analyze both algorithms proposed by Abrams and Lloyd on
concrete, simple models of nonlinear evolution. The description I choose is
known to be free of the unphysical influences (therefore it is not the Weinberg
one). I show, in particular, that the correct local formalism allows even to
simplify the algorithm.

knowledge about a quantum system ? For the case where the system is in fact
known to be in a pure state there is an obvious answer, corresponding to the
unique unitarily-invariant measure on the Hilbert sphere. However, the problem
is open for the general case where states are described by density operators.
Here two approaches to the problem are investigated.
  The first approach assumes that the system is randomly correlated with a
second system, where the ensemble of composite systems is described by a random
pure state. Results for qubits randomly correlated with other systems are
presented, including average entanglement entropies. It is shown that maximum
correlation is guaranteed in the limit as one system becomes
infinite-dimensional.
  The second approach relies on choosing a metric on the space of density
operators, and generating a corresponding ensemble from the induced volume
element. Comparisons between the approaches are made for qubits, for which the
second approach (based on the Bures metric) yields the most symmetric, and
hence the least informative, ensemble of density operators.

  Black-Hole Puzzles Solved</title><description>  Statistical mechanics explains thermodynamics in terms of (quantum) mechanics
by equating the entropy of a microstate of a closed system with the logarithm
of the number of microstates in the macrostate to which it belongs, but the
question `what is a macrostate?' has never been answered except in a vague,
subjective, way. However Hawking's discovery of black hole evaporation led to a
formula for black hole entropy with no subjective element. In this letter, we
argue from this result, together with the assumption that `black hole
thermodynamics is just ordinary thermodynamics applied to black holes', that a
macrostate for a general (quantum gravitational) closed system is an
equivalence class of matter-gravity microstates with the same expectation
values for the matter degrees of freedom alone. Not only does this finally
answer the question `what is entropy?', but it also predicts the equality of
the thermodynamic entropy of a black hole with the matter and the gravity
entropy-like quantities derived from the Euclidean path integral. Furthermore
it gives us a clear glimpse of an ultimate synthesis of quantum theory and
gravity in which we see that (a) gravity acts as a universal environment, thus
predicting that, if the initial state of the universe is unentangled, its
entropy must go on increasing forever, (b) the gravitational field has degrees
of freedom, but no observables, thus enabling gravity to perform the trick of
providing an objective continual process of decoherence. All the above rests on
the validity of unitarity. The `information-loss puzzle' had raised doubts
about that. But we suggest a resolution for this puzzle.

First, we compare them with
their classical counterparts. We show that, if an automaton is required to give
the correct answer with a large probability (over 0.98), then the power of
1-way QFAs is equal to the power of 1-way reversible automata. However, quantum
automata giving the correct answer with smaller probabilities are more powerful
than reversible automata.
  Second, we show that 1-way QFAs can be very space-efficient. Namely, we
construct a 1-way QFA which is exponentially smaller than any equivalent
classical (even randomized) finite automaton. This construction may be useful
for design of other space-efficient quantum algorithms.
  Third, we consider several generalizations of 1-way QFAs. Here, our goal is
to find a model which is more powerful than 1-way QFAs keeping the quantum part
as simple as possible.

are described and their study justified. A quantum robot is a mobile quantum
system that includes a quantum computer and needed ancillary systems on board.
Quantum robots carry out tasks whose goals include specified changes in the
state of the environment or carrying out measurements on the environment. Each
task is a sequence of alternating computation and action phases. Computation
phase activities include determination of the action to be carried out in the
next phase and possible recording of information on neighborhood environmental
system states. Action phase activities include motion of the quantum robot and
changes of neighborhood environment system states. Models of quantum robots and
their interactions with environments are described using discrete space and
time. To each task is associated a unitary step operator T that gives the
single time step dynamics. T = T_{a}+T_{c} is a sum of action phase and
computation phase step operators. Conditions that T_{a} and T_{c} should
satisfy are given along with a description of the evolution as a sum over paths
of completed phase input and output states. A simple example of a task carrying
out a measurement on a very simple environment is analyzed. A decision tree for
the task is presented and discussed in terms of sums over phase paths. One sees
that no definite times or durations are associated with the phase steps in the
tree and that the tree describes the successive phase steps in each path in the
sum.

meanfield acting on neutrons and protons differently. A further coupling is
observed by collisional correlations. The latter one leads to the appearance of
a new soft mode besides isoscalar and isovector modes in the system. We suggest
that this mode might be observable in asymmetric systems. This soft mode
approaches the isovector mode for high temperatures. At the same time the
isovector mode remains finite and approaches a constant value at higher
temperatures showing a transition from zero sound like damping to first sound.
The damping of the new soft mode is first sound like at all temperatures.

spherical collapse to directly show that the condition for formation of trapped
surfaces, 2GM/R &gt;1 is not allowed by GTR. And therefore all singularity
theorems based on the assumption of formation of trapped surfaces are
invalidated! Our conclusion is in perfect agreement with Einstein's intuitive
idea that a Sch. like surface can not occur in reality. Further as singularity
is approached R -&gt;0, in order that 2GM/R &lt;= 1, we must have M -&gt;0! Harrison, et
al. had also pointed out that collapse should come to a decisive end with M=0.
This is possible in GTR if the fluid radiates its entire original mass-energy
during the relentless graviatational contraction process, Q-&gt;M c^2! Since the
actual efficiency for gamma ray production by the relevant blast wave may
hardly exceed 10-20% and there could be a stronger (undetected) nu-anti-nu
burst precding GRBs, the actual energy released for GRB 990123, even accounting
for probable weak beaming, or for GRB 971214 (unbeamed) could be ~10^{54-55}
erg. And such energy release may not be properly accountable without realizing
that trapped surfaces are indeed not formed. All authors concerned with this
subject, and particularly those, who would like to differ with our derivation
are requested to send their criticism either directly or express the same

For ratios of determinants encountered in semiclassical fluctuations around a

  In the presence of a zero mode, our method allows for a simple universal

high fidelity. We show that under certain circumstances a quantum network
supplied with a maximally entangled input still yields a smaller global cost,
provided that $n$ belongs to a given interval $n\in [n_{min},n_{max}]$. The
values of $n_{min}$ and $n_{max}$ crucially depend on the purification
protocols used to establish the $n$-- processor entangled states, as well as on
the presence of decoherence processes during the computation. The phase
estimation problem has been used to illustrate this fact.

is not compatible with the reduction postulate, even when decoherence is taken
into account. The violation of the causal evolution, introduced by the standard
reduction postulate distinguishes certain systems (as the measurement devices),
whose states are very close to statistical mixtures (as the ones resulting from
the process of decoherence). In these systems, this violation has not any
observable effect. In arbitrary quantum systems, the transition from the
initial density matrix to a diagonal matrix predicted by the standard reduction
postulate, would lead to a complete breakdown of the Schr\&quot;odinger evolution,
and consequently would destroy all the predictive power of quantum mechanics.
What we show here, is that there is a modified version of the postulate that
allows to treat all the quantum mechanical systems on equal footing. The
standard reduction postulate may be considered as a good approximation, useful
for practical purposes, of this modified version which is consistent with the
Schr\&quot;odinger evolution and via decoherence with the experimental results.
Within this approach, the physical role played by the reduction postulate is as
a tool for the computation of relative probabilities and consequently for the
determination of the probabilities of consistent histories.

  A Geometric Mechanism for Energy-Level Broadening</title><description>  The generic Berry phase scenario in which a two-level system is coupled to a
second system whose dynamical coordinate is slowly-varying is generalized to
allow for stochastic evolution of the slow system. The stochastic behavior is
produced by coupling the slow system to a heat resevoir which is modeled by a
bath of harmonic oscillators initially in equilibrium at temperature T, and
whose spectral density has a bandwidth which is small compared to the
energy-level spacing of the fast system. The well-known energy-level shifts
produced by Berry's phase in the fast system, in conjunction with the
stochastic motion of the slow system, leads to a broadening of the fast system
energy-levels. In the limit of strong damping and sufficiently low temperature,
we determine the degree of level-broadening analytically, and show that the
slow system dynamics satisfies a Langevin equation in which Lorentz-like and
electric-like forces appear as a consequence of geometrical effects. We also
determine the average energy-level shift produced in the fast system by this
mechanism.

almost every sequence $\{S^N_j\}$, the associated sequence of zero currents
$1/N Z_{S^N_j}$ tends to the curvature form $\omega$ of $L$. Thus, the zeros of
a sequence of sections $s_N \in H^0(M, L^N)$ chosen independently and at random
become uniformly distributed. Our second result concerns the zeros of quantum
ergodic eigenfunctions, where the relevant orthonormal bases $\{S^N_j\}$ of

omega.omega* to be zero, with omega = A + gamma^5 B. We show that the field
equations of such a theory possess a soliton-like solution which can represent
a priori a &quot;charged particle&quot;, since it is endowed with a Coulomb field plus
the field of a magnetic dipole. The rest energy of the soliton is finite, and
the angular momentum stored in its electromagnetic field can be identified
--for suitable choices of the parameters-- with the spin of the charged
particle. Thus this approach seems to yield a classical model for the charged
(spinning) particle, which does not meet the problems met by earlier attempts
in the same direction.

particular Barut-Zanghi (BZ) solution, which refers (at the classical limit) to
an internal helical motion with a time-like speed [and is here shown to

of the Dirac equation]. Then, we show how to construct solutions of the Dirac
equation describing helical motions with light-like speed, which meet very well
the standard interpretation of the velocity operator in the Dirac equation
theory (and agree with the solution proposed by Hestenes, on the basis
--however-- of ad-hoc assumptions that are unnecessary in the present

joint measurement of position and momentum is investigated. In a previous paper
the problem was discussed in the context of the unbiased measurements
considered by Arthurs and Kelly. It is now shown, that suitably modified
versions of these results hold for a much larger class of simultaneous
measurements. The approach is a development of that adopted by Braginsky and
Khalili in the case of a single measurement of position only. A distinction is
made between the errors of retrodiction and the errors of prediction. Two
error-error relationships and four error-disturbance relationships are derived,
supplementing the Uncertainty Principle usually so-called. In the general case
it is necessary to take into account the range of the measuring apparatus. Both
the ideal case, of an instrument having infinite range, and the case of a real
instrument, for which the range is finite, are discussed.

  Generalized Valuations</title><description>  The Kochen-Specker theorem asserts the impossibility of assigning values to
quantum quantities in a way that preserves functional relations between them.
We construct a new type of valuation which is defined on all operators, and
which respects an appropriate version of the functional composition principle.
The truth-values assigned to propositions are (i) contextual; and (ii)
multi-valued, where the space of contexts and the multi-valued logic for each
context come naturally from the topos theory of presheaves.
  The first step in our theory is to demonstrate that the Kochen-Specker
theorem is equivalent to the statement that a certain presheaf defined on the
category of self-adjoint operators has no global elements. We then show how the
use of ideas drawn from the theory of presheaves leads to the definition of a
generalized valuation in quantum theory whose values are sieves of operators.
In particular, we show how each quantum state leads to such a generalized

radiofrequency pulses that repetitively flip the state of the system, a
technique that can be termed quantum &quot;bang-bang&quot; control after its classical

  Introduction. The evolution transport</title><description>  We propose a new systematic fibre bundle formulation of nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics. The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one
but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and
potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure
state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. Its evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\&quot;odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  The present first part of this investigation is devoted to the introduction
of basic concepts on which the fibre bundle approach to quantum mechanics
rests. We show that the evolution of pure quantum-mechanical states can be
described as a suitable linear transport along paths, called evolution
transport, of the state sections in the Hilbert fibre bundle of states of a
considered quantum system.

linearized Langevin equations. It is shown that the interference betweeen the
laser mode and the fluctuating light field in the non-lasing mode causes
spatial holeburning. This effect introduces a phase sensitive coupling between
the laser field and the fluctuations in the non-lasing mode. For high laser
fields, this coupling splits the spectrum of the non-lasing mode into a triplet
consisting of two relaxation oscillation sidebands which are in phase with the
laser light and a center line at the lasing frequency with a phase shift of pi
half relative to the laser light. As the laser intensity is increased close to

points. The usual approaches involve promotion of c-numbers to q-numbers, or
path integral constructs, each of which generally succeeds only in Cartesian
coordinates. All quantization schemes that lead to Hilbert space vectors and
Weyl operators---even those that eschew Cartesian coordinates---implicitly
contain a metric on a flat phase space. This feature is demonstrated by
studying the classical and quantum ``aggregations'', namely, the set of all
facts and properties resident in all classical and quantum theories,
respectively. Metrical quantization is an approach that elevates the flat phase
space metric inherent in any canonical quantization to the level of a
postulate. Far from being an unwanted structure, the flat phase space metric
carries essential physical information. It is shown how the metric, when
employed within a continuous-time regularization scheme, gives rise to an
unambiguous quantization procedure that automatically leads to a canonical
coherent state representation. Although attention in this paper is confined to
canonical quantization we note that alternative, nonflat metrics may also be
used, and they generally give rise to qualitatively different, noncanonical
quantization schemes.

Strategies in classical game theory are either pure (deterministic) or mixed

example, closely related to the traditional Matching Pennies game. While not
every two-person zero-sum finite game has an equilibrium in the set of pure
strategies, von Neumann showed that there is always an equilibrium at which
each player follows a mixed strategy. A mixed strategy deviating from the
equilibrium strategy cannot increase a player's expected payoff. We show,
however, that in our example a player who implements a quantum strategy can
increase his expected payoff, and explain the relation to efficient quantum
algorithms. We prove that in general a quantum strategy is always at least as
good as a classical one, and furthermore that when both players use quantum
strategies there need not be any equilibrium, but if both are allowed mixed
quantum strategies there must be.

of systems having embedded eigenvalues in their continuous spectrum. Problems
with this mathematical structure arise in the study of many physical systems,
e.g. the coupling of an atom or molecule to a photon-radiation field, and Auger
states of the helium atom, as well as in spectral geometry and number theory.
We present a dynamic (time-dependent) theory of such quantum resonances. The
key hypotheses are (i) a resonance condition which holds generically
(non-vanishing of the {\it Fermi golden rule}) and (ii) local decay estimates
for the unperturbed dynamics with initial data consisting of continuum modes
associated with an interval containing the embedded eigenvalue of the
unperturbed Hamiltonian. No assumption of dilation analyticity of the potential
is made. Our method explicitly demonstrates the flow of energy from the
resonant discrete mode to continuum modes due to their coupling. The approach
is also applicable to nonautonomous linear problems and to nonlinear problems.
We derive the time behavior of the resonant states for intermediate and long
times. Examples and applications are presented. Among them is a proof of the
instability of an embedded eigenvalue at a threshold energy under suitable
hypotheses.

effective semiconductor QLEs and the associated noise correlations which are
valid at a low-injection level and in real devices. Applying the semiconductor
QLEs to semiconductor light-emitting devices (LEDs), we obtain a new formula
for the Fano factor of photons which gives the photon-number statistics as a
function of the pump statistics and several parameters of LEDs. Key ingredients
are non-radiative processes, carrier-number dependence of the radiative and
non-radiative lifetimes, and multimodeness of LEDs. The formula is applicable
to the actual cases where the quantum efficiency $\eta$ differs from the
differential quantum efficiency $\eta_{d}$, whereas previous theories
implicitly assumed $\eta = \eta_{d}$. It is also applicable to the cases when
photons in each mode of the cavity are emitted and/or detected inhomogeneously.
When $\eta_{d} &lt; \eta$ at a running point, in particular, our formula predicts
that even a Poissonian pump can produce sub-Poissonian light. This mechanism
for generation of sub-Poissonian light is completely different from those of
previous theories, which assumed sub-Poissonian statistics for the current
injected into the active layers of LEDs. Our results agree with recent
experiments. We also discuss frequency dependence of the photon statistics.

examined. A macroscopic approach is adopted in which the averaged force is
computed from the Maxwell stress tensor. The particular case of a perfectly
reflecting wall and a sphere with a dielectric function given by the Drude
model is examined in detail. It is found that the force can be expressed as the
sum of a monotonically decaying function of position and of an oscillatory
piece. At large separations, the oscillatory piece is the dominant
contribution, and is much larger than the Casimir-Polder interaction that
arises in the limit that the sphere is a perfect conductor. It is argued that
this enhancement of the force can be interpreted in terms of the frequency
spectrum of vacuum fluctuations. In the limit of a perfectly conducting sphere,
there are cancellations between different parts of the spectrum which no longer
occur as completely in the case of a sphere with frequency dependent
polarizability. Estimates of the magnitude of the oscillatory component of the

arbitrary values of the nonlinearity parameter. The results are shown to be
true even for the higher order nonlinear dispersion equations for compactons.
Some new conservation laws for the higher order nonlinear dispersion equations
are also presented.

  Equations of motion and observables</title><description>  We propose a new systematic fibre bundle formulation of nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics. The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one
but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and
potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure
state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. Its evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\&quot;odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  In the second part of this investigation we derive several forms of the
bundle (analogue of the) Schr\&quot;odinger equation governing the time evolution of
state sections. We prove that up to a constant the matrix-bundle Hamiltonian,
entering in the bundle analogue of the matrix form of the conventional
Schr\&quot;odinger equation, coincides with the matrix of coefficients of the
evolution transport. This allows to interpret the Hamiltonian as a gauge field.
Here we also apply the bundle approach to the description of observables. It is
shown that to any observable there corresponds a unique Hermitian bundle
morphism (along paths) and vice versa.

the machine yields faithful copies of the input states. It is shown that the
states secretly chosen from a certain set $\$=\left\{\left| \Psi_1\right&gt;

  statistics</title><description>  Let X = (x_0,...,x_{n-1})$ be a sequence of n numbers. For \epsilon &gt; 0, we
say that x_i is an \epsilon-approximate median if the number of elements
strictly less than x_i, and the number of elements strictly greater than x_i
are each less than (1+\epsilon)n/2. We consider the quantum query complexity of
computing an \epsilon-approximate median, given the sequence X as an oracle. We
prove a lower bound of \Omega(\min{{1/\epsilon},n}) queries for any quantum
algorithm that computes an \epsilon-approximate median with any constant
probability greater than 1/2. We also show how an \epsilon-approximate median
may be computed with O({1/\epsilon}\log({1\/\epsilon}) \log\log({1/\epsilon}))
oracle queries, which represents an improvement over an earlier algorithm due
to Grover. Thus, the lower bound we obtain is essentially optimal. The upper
and the lower bound both hold in the comparison tree model as well.
  Our lower bound result is an application of the polynomial paradigm recently
introduced to quantum complexity theory by Beals et al. The main ingredient in
the proof is a polynomial degree lower bound for real multilinear polynomials
that ``approximate'' symmetric partial boolean functions. The degree bound
extends a result of Paturi and also immediately yields lower bounds for the
problems of approximating the kth-smallest element, approximating the mean of a
sequence of numbers, and that of approximately counting the number of ones of a
boolean function. All bounds obtained come within polylogarithmic factors of
the optimal (as we show by presenting algorithms where no such optimal or near
optimal algorithms were known), thus demonstrating the power of the polynomial
method.

crossings are formed when a chaotic singlet intersects a tunnel doublet. We
study the dissipative quantum dynamics in the vicinity of such crossings. A
harmonically driven double well coupled to a bath serves as a model. Markov and
rotating-wave approximations are introduced with respect to the Floquet
spectrum of the time-dependent central system. The resulting master equation is
integrated numerically. We find various types of transient tunneling,
determined by the relation of the level width to the inherent energy scales of
the crossing. The decay of coherent tunneling can be significantly retarded or
accelerated. Modifications of the quantum asymptotic state by the crossing are
also studied. The comparison with a simple three-state model shows that in
contrast to the undamped case, the participation of states outside the crossing
cannot be neglected in the presence of dissipation.

greater than 95%. This contrasts the power of classical computers which would
require N calls to achieve the same task. From this result it follows that any

This is when only a certain fraction of the N oracle bits are requested. Also
for this scenario does the quantum algorithm outperform the classical

emphasis on how they may restrict their experimental feasibility. Though
&quot;protective&quot; measurements result in an unchanged system state and a shift of
the pointer proportional to the expectation value of the measured observable in
the system state, the actual reading of the pointer position gives rise to
several subtleties. We propose several schemes for reading pointer position,
both when the apparatus is treated as a classical system as well as when its
quantum aspects are taken into account, that address these issues. The tiny
entanglement which is always present due to deviation from extreme adiabaticity
in realistic situations is argued to be the weakest aspect of the proposal.
Because of this, one can never perform a protective measurement on a single
quantum system with absolute certainty. This clearly precludes an ontological
status for the wave function. Several other conceptual issues are also
discussed.

quantum systems are performed. But how one can estimate (guess) quantum state
when just incomplete data are available (known)? What is the most reliable
estimation based on a given measured data? What is the optimal measurement
providing only a finite number of identically prepared quantum objects are

(1) We show how the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle can be efficiently used

a quantum computer but not a classical computer. One consequence of this
observation is that there is an oracle which is of no assistance to a classical

Thus useful relativized separations between quantum and classical complexity
classes must exclude the transmission of phase information from oracle to

by the little groups of the Poincar\'e group, it is possible to construct
representations of the little group for massive particles starting from
harmonic oscillator wave functions for the quark model. The resulting
oscillator wave functions are covariant and can be Lorentz-boosted. It is thus
possible to obtain the parton model by boosting the quark model. A review of
Wigner's theory of the little groups is given. It is shown that the covariant
oscillator wave functions become squeezed as as the system becomes boosted. It
is shown also that the Lorentz-squeezed quark distribution exhibits the
peculiarities of Feynman's parton model including the lack of coherence in the
calculation of cross sections. A historical review of the concept of covariance

introduced. These machines produce two imperfect copies of a single state that
emerge from two distinct Heisenberg channels. The tradeoff between the quality
of these copies is shown to result from a complementarity akin to Heisenberg
uncertainty principle. A no-cloning inequality is derived for isotropic
cloners: if $\pi_a$ and $\pi_b$ are the depolarizing fractions associated with
the two copies, the domain in $(\sqrt{\pi_a},\sqrt{\pi_b})$-space located
inside a particular ellipse representing close-to-perfect cloning is forbidden.
More generally, a no-cloning uncertainty relation is discussed, quantifying the
impossibility of copying imposed by quantum mechanics. Finally, an asymmetric
Pauli cloning machine is defined that makes two approximate copies of a quantum
bit, while the input-to-output operation underlying each copy is a (distinct)
Pauli channel. The class of symmetric Pauli cloning machines is shown to
provide an upper bound on the quantum capacity of the Pauli channel of
probabilities $p_x$, $p_y$ and $p_z$.

sonoluminescence in terms of photon production due to changes in the properties
of the quantum-electrodynamic (QED) vacuum arising from a collapsing dielectric
bubble. This mechanism can be re-phrased in terms of the Casimir effect and has
recently been the subject of considerable controversy. The present paper probes
Schwinger's suggestion in detail: Using the sudden approximation we calculate
Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum in the presence of the expanded
bubble to that in the presence of the collapsed bubble. In this way we derive
an estimate for the spectrum and total energy emitted. We verify that in the
sudden approximation there is an efficient production of photons, and further
that the main contribution to this dynamic Casimir effect comes from a volume
term, as per Schwinger's original calculation. However, we also demonstrate
that the timescales required to implement Schwinger's original suggestion are
not physically relevant to sonoluminescence. Although Schwinger was correct in
his assertion that changes in the zero-point energy lead to photon production,
nevertheless his original model is not appropriate for sonoluminescence. In
other works (see quant-ph/9805023, quant-ph/9904013, quant-ph/9904018,
quant-ph/9905034) we have developed a variant of Schwinger's model that is

space-time, individuated by a quantum object. It is known that these
observables cannot be described by self-adjoint operators or by the
corresponding spectral projection-valued measure. We describe them by means of
a positive-operator-valued (POV) measure in the Minkowski space-time,
satisfying a suitable covariance condition with respect to the Poincare' group.
This POV measure determines the probability that a measurement of the
coordinates of the event gives results belonging to a given set in space-time.
We show that this measure must vanish on the vacuum and the one-particle
states, which cannot define any event. We give a general expression for the
Poincare' covariant POV measures. We define the baricentric events, which lie
on the world-line of the centre-of-mass, and we find a simple expression for
the average values of their coordinates. Finally, we discuss the conditions
which permit the determination of the coordinates with an arbitrary accuracy.

  QED</title><description>  We propose physical interpretations for stochastic methods which have been
developed recently to describe the evolution of a quantum system interacting
with a reservoir. As opposed to the usual reduced density operator approach,
which refers to ensemble averages, these methods deal with the dynamics of
single realizations, and involve the solution of stochastic Schr\&quot;odinger
equations. These procedures have been shown to be completely equivalent to the
master equation approach when ensemble averages are taken over many
realizations. We show that these techniques are not only convenient
mathematical tools for dissipative systems, but may actually correspond to
concrete physical processes, for any temperature of the reservoir. We consider
a mode of the electromagnetic field in a cavity interacting with a beam of two-
or three-level atoms, the field mode playing the role of a small system and the
atomic beam standing for a reservoir at finite temperature, the interaction
between them being given by the Jaynes-Cummings model. We show that the
evolution of the field states, under continuous monitoring of the state of the
atoms which leave the cavity, can be described in terms of either the Monte
Carlo Wave-Function (quantum jump) method or a stochastic Schr\&quot;odinger
equation, depending on the system configuration. We also show that the Monte
Carlo Wave-Function approach leads, for finite temperatures, to localization
into jumping Fock states, while the diffusion equation method leads to
localization into states with a diffusing average photon number, which for
sufficiently small temperatures are close approximations to mildly squeezed
states.

Exceptional points are the singularities of the spectrum and eigenfunctions,

that the positions of the exceptional points (their accumulation point in the

media. The turn-on of parametric amplification in finite media, followed by
illumination by spectrally narrow probe wavepackets, can give rise to transient
tachyonic wavepackets. In the stable (sub-threshold) operating regime of an
optical phase conjugator it is possible to transmit probe pulses with a
superluminally advanced peak, whereas conjugate reflection is always
subluminal. In the unstable (above-threshold) regime, superluminal response
occurs both in reflection and in transmission, at times preceding the onset of
exponential growth due to the instability. Remarkably, the quantum information
transmitted by probe or conjugate pulses, albeit causal, is confined to times
corresponding to superluminal velocities. These phenomena are explicitly
analyzed for four-wave mixing, stimulated Raman scattering and parametric

The fact that the function is analytic means that perfectly precise knowledge

inaccessible form. It is shown that an explicate description of various aspects
of the system can be found localised on various 2 real dimensional surfaces in

the purely imaginary part of complexified phase space provides an explicate
description of the Wigner function.

universal time. Originally this space was filled with a uniform substance,
pictured as a liquid, which at some time became supercooled. Our universe began
as a nucleation event initiating a liquid to solid transition. The universe we
inhabit and are directly aware of consists of only the three-dimensional
expanding phase boundary. Random energy transfers to the boundary from thermal
fluctuations in the adjacent bulk phases are interpreted by us as quantum
fluctuations. Fermionic matter is modeled as screw dislocations; gauge bosons
as phonons. Minkowski space emerges dynamically through redefining local time
to be proportional to the spatial coordinate perpendicular to the boundary.
Other features include a geometrical quantum gravitational theory, and an
explanation of quantum measurement.

  fields</title><description>  The complex processes leading to the collisional population of
ultra-long-lived Rydberg states with very high angular momentum can be
explained surprisingly well using classical mechanics. In this article, we
explain the reason behind this striking agreement between classical theory and
experiment by showing that the classical and quantum dynamics of Rydberg
electrons in weak, slowly varying external fields agree beyond the mandates of
Ehrenfest's Theorem. In particular, we show that the expectation values of
angular momentum and Runge-Lenz vectors in hydrogenic eigenstates obey exactly
the same perturbative equations of motion as the time averages of the
corresponding classical variables. By time averaging the quantum dynamics over
a Kepler period, we extend this special quantum-classical equivalence to
Rydberg wave packets relatively well localized in energy. Finally, the
perturbative equations hold well also for external fields beyond the
Inglis-Teller limit, and in the case of elliptic states, which yield the
appropriate quasi-classical initial conditions, the matching with classical
mechanics is complete.

Gedankenexperiment accelerating single electrons with photons of suitably low
frequency. Accounting for relativistic time dilation due to the acquired
velocity and in infinite repetition of single absorption processes it can be
shown that the kinetic energy in the infinite limit is equal to m_{e} c^{2}/2.
However, the inertial mass of the electron seems enhanced, and it can be
established that this enhancement is described by the relativistic mass effect.
It appears, therefore, that although there exists a singularity in interactions
- the frequency required to accelerate the particle near the limit of c becomes
infinite - the energy of the particle itself approaches a finite limit.
Comparing with calculations of the Lamb-shift by Bethe this result seems to
provide the ultimate justification for the renormalization procedures employed.

variables that will generally become effectively classical are the local
densities (number, momentum, energy). That is, in the context of the decoherent
histories approach to quantum theory, it is expected that histories of these
variables will be approximately decoherent, and that their probabilites will be
strongly peaked about hydrodynamic equations. This possibility is explored for
the case of the diffusion of the number density of a dilute concentration of
foreign particles in a fluid. This system has the appealing feature that the
microscopic dynamics of each individual foreign particle is readily obtained
and the approach to local equilibrium may be seen explicitly. It is shown that,
for certain physically reasonable initial states, the probabilities for
histories of number density are strongly peaked about evolution according to
the diffusion equation. Decoherence of these histories is also shown for a
class of initial states which includes non-trivial superpositions of number
density. Histories of phase space densities are also discussed. The case of
histories of number, momentum and energy density for more general systems, such
as a dilute gas, is also discussed in outline. When the initial state is a
local equilibrium state, it is shown that the histories are trivally
decoherent, and that the probabilities for histories are peaked about
hydrodynamic equations. An argument for decoherence of more general initial
states is given.

time-symmetric, the rigged Hilbert space formulation, which arose from Dirac's
bra-ket formalism, allows the choice of asymmetric boundary conditions
analogous to the retarded solutions of the Maxwell equations for the radiation
arrow of time. This led to irreversibility on the microphysical level as
exemplified by decaying states or resonances. Resonances are mathematically
represented by Gamow kets, functionals over a space of very well-behaved (Hardy

decaying states). Gamow states have all the properties that one heuristically
needs for quasistable states. For them a Golden Rule can be derived from the
fundamental probabilities that fulfills the time-asymmetry condition which

stability of correlations between the einselected quantum pointer states and
the environment allows them to exist almost as objectively as classical states
were once thought to exist: There are ways of finding out what is the pointer
state of the system which utilize redundancy of their correlations with the
environment, and which leave einselected states essentially unperturbed. This
relatively objective existence of certain quantum states facilitates
operational definition of probabilities in the quantum setting. Moreover, once
there are states that `exist' and can be `found out', a `collapse' in the
traditional sense is no longer necessary --- in effect, it has already
happened. The records of the observer will contain evidence of an effective
collapse. The role of the preferred states in the processing and storage of

relatively objective existence of stable correlations between the einselected
states of observers memory and in the outside Universe is formulated and

non-orthogonality of the states. The capacity of the corresponding quantum

explicitly provides the complete, consistent solution as a set of many
incompatible components ('realisations') which should permanently and
probabilistically replace one another, since each of them is 'complete' in the
ordinary sense. This discovery leads to the universally applicable concept of
dynamic complexity and self-consistent, realistic resolution of the stagnating
problems of quantum chaos, quantum measurement, indeterminacy and wave
reduction. The peculiar, 'mysterious' character of quantum behaviour itself is
seen now as a result of a dynamically complex, intrinsically multivalued
behaviour of interacting fields at the corresponding lowest levels of the (now
completely causal) structure of reality. Incorporating the results of the
canonical theories as an over-simplified limiting case, this new approach
urgently needs support, since its causality and completeness are directly
extendible to arbitrary cases of complex behaviour of real systems, in sharp
contrast to the dominating inefficient empiricism of 'computer experimentation'
with primitive mechanistic (i. e. dynamically single-valued) 'models' of the
irreducibly multivalued reality.

quantum measurement theory gives the following novel computational possibility:
suppose that we have a quantum computer with an on/off switch, programmed ready
to solve a decision problem. Then (in certain circumstances) the mere fact that
the computer would have given the answer if it were run, is enough for us to
learn the answer, even though the computer is in fact not run.

show that a single two-qubit Werner state, or any other mixture of the
maximally entangled Bell states, cannot be purified by local operations and
classical communications. We generalise their result and give a simple
explanation. In particular, we show that no purification scheme using local
operations and classical communications can produce a pure singlet from any
mixed state of two spin-1/2 particles. More generally, no such scheme can
produce a maximally entangled state of any pair of finite-dimensional systems
from a generic mixed state. We also show that the Werner states belong to a
large class of states whose fidelity cannot be increased by such a scheme.

  The main result in this paper is a solution for the subroutine problem: The

  We suggest convenient metrics for quantum computing with mixed states. For

  Using a ``causality'' lemma for density matrices, we also prove a simple

  Band Edge</title><description>  We discuss a point model for the collective emission of light from N
two-level atoms in a photonic bandgap material, each with an atomic resonant
frequency near the edge of the gap. In the limit of a low initial occupation of
the excited atomic state, our system is shown to possess novel atomic spectra
and population statistics. For a high initial excited state population, mean
field theory suggests a fractionalized inversion and a macroscopic polarization
for the atoms in the steady state, both of which can be controlled by an
external d.c. field. This atomic steady state is accompanied by a non--zero
expectation value of the electric field operators for field modes located in
the vicinity of the atoms. The nature of homogeneous broadening near the band
edge is shown to differ markedly from that in free space due to non-Markovian
memory effects in the radiation dynamics. Non-Markovian vacuum fluctuations are
shown to yield a partially coherent steady state polarization with a random
phase. In contrast with the steady state of a conventional laser, near a
photonic band edge this coherence occurs as a consequence of photon
localization in the absence of a conventional cavity mode. We also introduce a
classical stochastic function with the same temporal correlations as the
electromagnetic reservoir, in order to stochastically simulate the effects of
vacuum fluctuations near a photonic band edge.

starting point of multipolar coupled atoms interacting with an electromagnetic
field. The dispersion relations obtained are equivalent to the standard
classical Sellmeir equations obtained from the Drude-Lorentz model. In the
homogeneous (plane-wave) case, we obtain the detailed quantum mode structure of
the coupled polariton fields, and show that the mode expansion in all branches
of the dispersion relation is completely defined by the refractive index and
the group-velocity for the polaritons. We demonstrate a straightforward
procedure for exactly diagonalizing the Hamiltonian in one, two or
three-dimensional environments, even in the presence of longitudinal
phonon-exciton dispersion, and an arbitrary number of resonant transitions with
different frequencies. This is essential, since it is necessary to include at
least one phonon (I.R.) and one exciton (U.V.) mode, in order to accurately
represent dispersion in transparent solid media. Our method of diagonalization
does not require an explicit solution of the dispersion relation, but relies
instead on the analytic properties of Cauchy contour integrals over all
possible mode frequencies. When there is longitudinal phonon dispersion, the
relevant group-velocity term is modified so that it only includes the purely
electromagnetic part of the group velocity.

  Pictures and integrals of motion</title><description>  We propose a new systematic fibre bundle formulation of nonrelativistic
quantum mechanics. The new form of the theory is equivalent to the usual one
but it is in harmony with the modern trends in theoretical physics and
potentially admits new generalizations in different directions. In it a pure
state of some quantum system is described by a state section (along paths) of a
(Hilbert) fibre bundle. It's evolution is determined through the bundle
(analogue of the) Schr\&quot;odinger equation. Now the dynamical variables and the
density operator are described via bundle morphisms (along paths). The
mentioned quantities are connected by a number of relations derived in this
work.
  In this third part of our series we investigate the bundle analogues of the
conventional pictures of motion. In particular, there are found the state
sections and bundle morphisms corresponding to state vectors and observables
respectively. The equations of motion for these quantities are derived too.
Using the results obtained, we consider from the bundle view-point problems
concerning the integrals of motion. An invariant (bundle) necessary and
sufficient conditions for a dynamical variable to be an integral of motion are
found.

field are formulated for general states of quantised radiation and their
violation is connected to other nonclassical properties of the field. This is
achieved by considering states with an arbitrary number of photons and
carefully identifying the hermitian operators whose expectation values do not
admit any local hidden variable description. We relate the violation of these
multi-photon inequalities to properties of phase space distribution functions
such as the diagonal coherent state distribution function and the Wigner

distributions is analysed, bringing out in this case the connection of
violation of Bell type inequalities with the nonclassical property of
squeezing.

positron emission occurs for a well if the potential is strong enough. The

enough, a seemingly constant current is emitted. These phenomena are transient
whereas the tunnelling first calculated by Klein is time-independent. Klein
tunnelling is a property of relativistic wave equations, not necessarily
connected to particle emission. The Coulomb potential is investigated in this
context: it is shown that a heavy nucleus of sufficiently large $Z$ will bind
positrons. Correspondingly, it is expected that as $Z$ increases the Coulomb
barrier will become increasingly transparent to positrons. This is an example

along the path. Apparent disagreements in the literature about the topological

that the internal structures of extended particles comply with a wave-equation.
Including external potentials yields the Schrodinger equation, which, in this

Electrostatic interactions justify the initial assumption of electron-wave

invariant quantity. Correspondingly, reference frame dependence and gauge
dependence are inherited to most of the elements of the usual formulation of
quantum mechanics (including operators, states and events). If a frame
dependent and gauge dependent formalism is called, in short, a relative
formalism, then the aim of the paper is to establish an absolute, i.e., frame
and gauge free, reformulation of quantum mechanics. To fulfil this aim, we
develop absolute quantities and the corresponding equations instead of the wave
function and the Schr\&quot;odinger equation. The absolute quantities have a more
direct physical interpretation than the wave function has, and the
corresponding equations express explicitly the independent physical aspects of
the system which are contained in the Schr\&quot;odinger equation in a mixed and
more hidden form. Based on the absolute quantities and equations, events,
states and physical quantities are introduced also in an absolute way. The
formalism makes it possible to obtain some sharper versions of the uncertainty
relation and to extend the validity of Ehrenfest's theorem. The absolute
formulation allows wide extensions of quantum mechanics. To give examples, we
discuss two known nonlinear extensions and, in close detail, a dissipative
system. An argument is provided that the absolute formalism may lead to an
explanation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect purely in terms of the electromagnetic
field strength tensor. At last, on special relativistic and curved spacetimes,
absolute quantities and equations instead of the Klein-Gordon wave function and

this earlier calculation uses an improper set of modes to describe the waves

dispersive and absorbing four-port device [T. Gruner and D.-G. Welsch, Phys.
Rev. A 54, 1661 (1996)] are used to derive the unitary transformation that
relates the output quantum state to the input quantum state, including
radiation and matter and without placing frequency restrictions. It is shown
that for each frequency the transformation can be regarded as a well-behaved
SU(4) group transformation that can be decomposed into a product of U(2) and
SU(2) group transformations. Each of them may be thought of as being realized
by a particular lossless four-port device. If for narrow-bandwidth radiation
far from the medium resonances the absorption matrix of the four-port device
can be disregarded, the well-known SU(2) group transformation for a lossless
device is recognized. Explicit formulas for the transformation of Fock-states

number of iterations of order $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the
search space, whereas any classical algorithm necessarily scales as $O(d)$. It
is shown here that an improved quantum search algorithm can be devised that
exploits the structure of a tree search problem by nesting this standard search
algorithm. The number of iterations required to find the solution of an average
instance of a constraint satisfaction problem scales as $\sqrt{d^\alpha}$, with
a constant $\alpha&lt;1$ depending on the nesting depth and the problem
considered. When applying a single nesting level to a problem with constraints
of size 2 such as the graph coloring problem, this constant $\alpha$ is
estimated to be around 0.62 for average instances of maximum difficulty. This
corresponds to a square-root speedup over a classical nested search algorithm,
of which our presented algorithm is the quantum counterpart.

  of common cause</title><description>  Reichenbach's Common Cause Principle claims that if there is correlation
between two events and none of them is directly causally influenced by the
other, then there must exist a third event that can, as a common cause, account
for the correlation. The EPR-Bell paradox consists in the problem that we
observe correlations between spatially separated events in the EPR-experiments,
which do not admit common-cause-type explanation; and it must therefore be
inevitably concluded, that, contrary to relativity theory, in the realm of
quantum physics there exists action at a distance, or at least superluminal
causal propagation is possible; that is, either relativity theory or
Reichenbach's common cause principle fails. By means of closer analyses of the
concept of common cause and a more precise reformulation of the EPR
experimental scenario, I will sharpen the conclusion we can draw from the
violation of Bell's inequalities. It will be explicitly shown that the
correla-tions we encounter in the EPR experiment could have common causes; that
is, Reichen-bach's Common Cause Principle does not fail in quantum mechanics.
Moreover, these common causes satisfy the locality conditions usually required.
In the Revised Version of the paper I added a Postscript from which it turns
out that the solution such obtained is, contrary to the original title,
incomplete. It turns out that a new problem arises: some combinations of the
common cause events do statistically cor-relate with the measurement
operations.

measurements we call the dynamics as quantum Zeno dynamics. We show that under
quantum Zeno dynamics not only the transition probability (leading to quantum
Zeno effect) but also phases are affected. We call this new effect as quantum
Zeno phase effect (QZPE) which says that under repeated measurements the
geometric phase of a quantum system can be inhibited. Since geometric phase
attributes a memory to a quatum system this result also proves that under
quantum Zeno dynamics the memory of a system can be erased. We have proposed a
neutron interference experiment where this prediction can be tested. We also
beleive that with Itano's kind of set up for two-level systems this prediction
can be tested. This will provide a new way of controlling phase shift in

  boundary conditions of a classical universe?</title><description>  The problem of defining the boundary conditions for the universe is
considered here in the framework of a classical dynamical theory, pointing out
that a measure on boundary conditions must be included in the theory in order
to explain the statistical regularities of evolution. It is then suggested that
quantum statistical regularities also could derive from this measure. An
explicit definition of such a measure is proposed, using both a simplified
model of the universe based on classical mechanics and the non-relativistic
quantum mechanics formalism. The peculiarity of such a measure is that it does
not apply to the initial conditions of the universe, i.e. to the initial
positions and momenta of particles, but to their initial and final positions,
from which the path is derived by means of the least action principle. This
formulation of the problem is crucial and it is supported by the observation
that it is incorrect to liken the determination of the boundary conditions of
the universe to the preparation of a laboratory system, in which the initial
conditions of the system are obviously determined. Some possible objections to
this theory are then discussed. Specifically, the EPR paradox is discussed, and
it is explained by showing that, in general, a measure on the boundary
conditions of the universe generates preinteractive correlations, and that in
the presence of such correlations Bell's inequality can no longer be proven
true. Finally, it is shown that if one broadens the dynamical scheme of the
theory to encompass phenomena such as particle decay and annihilation, the
least action principle allows for an indeterministic evolution of the system.

  Standards</title><description>  The paper presents an attempt to suggest an alternative way of considering
the fundamentals of Einstein's special relativity theory. Its formulation based
on introducing an inertial reference system by rigid linking of clocks to a
free entity to define proper time is self-contradictory since the operation of
rigid linking involves interaction which is excluded by definition for a free
entity. The way to overcome this inconsistency is proposed by postulating that
each free entity (object, particle) has to be ideal clocks by itself, providing
ideal internal time standards defined by the only intrinsic feature of a free
entity, namely its proper mass which means that de Broglie's periodic
phenomenon has to be considered as a fundamental principle needed to built the
special relativity, along with the principle of indistinguishability allowing
to define the particle's proper mass with ideal accuracy. Further, the internal
distance standard is provided by passing to Compton wavelength and the velocity
standard is introduced by means of Hubble's law. It is proposed to interpret
the wave function as an internal system of reference undergoing distortion when
external interaction is included.

  Matrices</title><description>  We extend to additional probability measures and scenarios, certain of the
recent results of Krattenthaler and Slater (quant-ph/9612043), whose original
motivation was to obtain quantum analogs of seminal work on universal data
compression of Clarke and Barron. KS obtained explicit formulas for the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the 2^m x 2^m density matrices derived by
averaging the m-fold tensor products with themselves of the 2 x 2 density
matrices. The weighting was done with respect to a one-parameter (u) family of
probability distributions, all the members of which are spherically-symmetric
(SU(2)-invariant) over the ``Bloch sphere'' of two-level quantum systems. For u
= 1/2, one obtains the normalized volume element of the minimal monotone
(Bures) metric. In this paper, analyses parallel to those of KS are conducted,
based on an alternative &quot;natural&quot; measure on the density matrices recently
proposed by Zyczkowski, Horodecki, Sanpera, and Lewenstein (quant-ph/9804024).
The approaches of KS and that based on ZHSL are found to yield [1 + m/2]
identical SU(2) x S_{m}-invariant eigenspaces (but not coincident eigenvalues
for m &gt; 3). Companion results, based on the SU(3) form of the ZHSL measure, are
obtained for the twofold and threefold tensor products of the 3 x 3 density
matrices. We find a rather remarkable limiting procedure (selection rule) for
recovering from these analyses, the (permutationally-symmetrized) multiplets of
SU(3) constructed from two or three particles. We also analyze the scenarios
(all for m = 2) N = 2 x 3, N= 2 x 3 x 2, N= 3 x 2 x 2 and N = 4 and, in
addition, generalize the ZHSL measure, so that it incorporates a family of
(symmetric) Dirichlet distributions (rather than simply the uniform
distribution), defined on the (N-1)-dimensional simplex of eigenvalues.

compare the strength of a classical computer that is allowed to ask two
questions to an NP-oracle with the strength of a quantum computer that is
allowed only one such query. It is shown that any decision problem that
requires two parallel (non-adaptive) SAT-queries on a classical computer can
also be solved exactly by a quantum computer using only one SAT-oracle call,
where both computations have polynomial time-complexity. Such a simulation is
generally believed to be impossible for a one-query classical computer. The
reduction also does not hold if we replace the SAT-oracle by a general
black-box. This result gives therefore an example of how a quantum computer is
probably more powerful than a classical computer. It also highlights the
potential differences between quantum complexity results for general oracles
when compared to results for more structured tasks like the SAT-problem.

computer in polynomial time, quantum computation has become a subject of
immense interest. Unfortunately, one of the key features of quantum computers -
the difficulty of describing them on classical computers - also makes it
difficult to describe and understand precisely what can be done with them. A
formalism describing the evolution of operators rather than states has proven
extremely fruitful in understanding an important class of quantum operations.
States used in error correction and certain communication protocols can be
described by their stabilizer, a group of tensor products of Pauli matrices.
Even this simple group structure is sufficient to allow a rich range of quantum
effects, although it falls short of the full power of quantum computation.

  Choice</title><description>  Measurements --- interactions which establish correlations between a system
and a recording device --- can be made thermodynamically reversible. One might
be concerned that such reversibility will make the second law of thermodynamics
vulnerable to the designs of the demon of choice, a selective version of
Maxwell's demon. The strategy of the demon of choice is to take advantage of
rare fluctuations to extract useful work, and to reversibly undo measurements
which do not lead to such a favorable but unlikely outcomes. I show that this
threat does not arise as the demon of choice cannot operate without recording
(explicitely or implicitely) whether its measurement was a success (or a
failure). Thermodynamic cost associated with such a record cannot be, on the
average, made smaller than the gain of useful work derived from the
fluctuations.

semiconductor laser devices. The QMBE are derived from fully quantum mechanical
operator dynamics describing the interaction of the light field with the
quantum states of the electrons and the holes near the band gap. By taking into
account field-field correlations and field-dipole correlations, the QMBE
include quantum noise effects which cause spontaneous emission and amplified
spontaneous emission. In particular, the source of spontaneous emission is
obtained by factorizing the dipole-dipole correlations into a product of
electron and hole densities. The QMBE are formulated for general devices, for
edge emitting lasers and for vertical cavity surface emitting lasers, providing
a starting point for the detailed analysis of spatial coherence in the near
field and far field patterns of such laser diodes. Analytical expressions are
given for the spectra of gain and spontaneous emission described by the QMBE.
These results are applied to the case of a broad area laser, for which the
frequency and carrier density dependent spontaneous emission factor beta and
the evolution of the far field pattern near threshold are derived.

point of view. This approach works for any interaction model and space-time

importance of the procedure for defining the ambiguities (corresponding to the
choice of the renormalization conditions in the conventional program) is fully
appreciated in the new approach. It is shown that the high energy theory(s) or
the underlying theory(s) in fact 'stipulates (stipulate)' the low energy and
effective ones through these definitions within our approach while all the
conventional methods miss this important point. Some simple but important
nonperturbative examples are discussed to show the power and plausibility of
the new approach. Other related issues (especially the IR problem and the

population inversion (LWI) in a coherently prepared closed three level V - type
system are investigated. This study is performed from the point of view of a
two color dressed state basis. Both of these processes are possible due to
atomic coherence and quantum interference contrary to simple intuitive
predictions. Merely on physical basis, one would expect a complementary process
to the amplification without inversion. We believe that absorption in the
presence of population inversion found in the dressed state picture utilized in
this study, constitutes such a process.
 Novel approximate analytic time dependent solutions, for coherences and
populations are obtained, and are compared with full numerical solutions
exhibiting excellent agreement. Steady state quantities are also calculated,
and the conditions under which the system exhibits absorption and gain with and
without inversion, in the dressed state representation are derived. It is found
that for a weak probe laser field absorption with inversion and amplification
without inversion may occur, for a range of system parameters.

Quantum Theory, makes certain claims about the properties of systems between
pre- and post- selection measurements. These claims are based on a
counterfactual usage of the Aharonov-Bergmann-Lebowitz (ABL) rule for

appear to be a loophole in those arguments and shows that this apparent
loophole cannot be used to support a counterfactual interpretation of the ABL
rule. It is noted that the invalidity of the counterfactual usage of the ABL
rule implies that the characterization of those outcomes receiving probability
1 in a counterfactual application of the rule as `elements of reality' is, in

for each experiment. It is shown that if a physical system consists of several
distant subsystems, and if the results of tests performed on the latter are
determined by local variables with objective values, then the joint
probabilities for triggering any given set of distant detectors are convex
combinations of a finite number of Boolean arrays, whose components are either
0 or 1 according to a simple rule. This convexity property is both necessary
and sufficient for the existence of local objective variables. It leads to a
simple graphical method which produces a large number of generalized Clauser-
Horne inequalities corresponding to the faces of a convex polytope. It is
plausible that quantum systems whose density matrix has a positive partial
transposition satisfy all these inequalities, and therefore are compatible with
local objective variables, even if their quantum properties are essentially
nonlocal.

locality contains an implicit form of realism, since in a world view that
embraces locality, spacetime, with its usual, fixed topology, has properties
independent of measurement. Hence we argue that response (i) is incomplete, in

as $\hbar \to 0$ the classical dynamics is returned. For Planck's constant
$h=1/N$, we show that the dynamics can be reduced to the dynamics on an

the same as given in ref. \QCITE{cite}{}{BV} except for a small correction of

history approach and are defined as certain bivariate complex-valued
functionals on the space of all histories. However, in practical situations --
for instance in the history formulation of standard quantum mechanics -- there
often is a global time direction and the homogeneous decoherence functionals
are specified by their values on the subspace of homogeneous histories.
  In this work we study the analytic properties of (i) the standard decoherence
functional in the history version of standard quantum mechanics and (ii)
homogeneous decoherence functionals in general history theories. We restrict
ourselves to the situation where the space of histories is given by the lattice
of projections on some Hilbert space H. Among other things we prove the
non-existence of a finitely valued extension for the standard decoherence
functional to the space of all histories, derive a representation for the
standard decoherence functional as an unbounded quadratic form with a natural
representation on a Hilbert space and prove the existence of an

quantum-dynamical systems in continuous space. Each member of the class is
characterized by a Hamiltonian which is the sum of two parts. While one part is
deterministic, time-independent and quadratic, the Weyl-Wigner symbol of the
other part is a homogeneous Gaussian random field which is delta correlated in
time, but smoothly correlated in position and momentum. The averaged dynamics
of the resulting white-noise system is shown to be a monotone mixing increasing
quantum-dynamical semigroup. Its generator is computed explicitly. Typically,
in the course of time the mean energy of such a system grows linearly to
infinity. In the second part of the paper an extended model is studied, which,
in addition, accounts for dissipation by coupling the white-noise system
linearly to a quantum-mechanical harmonic heat bath. It is demonstrated that,
under suitable assumptions on the spectral density of the heat bath, the mean
energy then saturates for long times.

a logical error. I analyze the concept of counterfactuals in quantum theory and
introduce time-symmetrized counterfactuals. These counterfactuals do not lead

four-interval is also the epistemological source of QM uncertainty relations.
Furthermore, the consetrvation of helicity in the propagation of a photon is a
relativistic invariant, and is the origin of the &quot;appearence&quot; of a paradox of
nonlocal interaction in Bell's inequality [2,3,4] as shown in A. Aspect et all

  correlation functions of open quantum systems</title><description>  Within the framework of probability distributions on projective Hilbert space
a scheme for the calculation of multitime correlation functions is developed.
The starting point is the Markovian stochastic wave function description of an
open quantum system coupled to an environment consisting of an ensemble of
harmonic oscillators in arbitrary pure or mixed states. It is shown that matrix
elements of reduced Heisenberg picture operators and general time-ordered
correlation functions can be expressed by time-symmetric expectation values of
extended operators in a doubled Hilbert space. This representation allows the
construction of a stochastic process in the doubled Hilbert space which enables
the determination of arbitrary matrix elements and correlation functions. The
numerical efficiency of the resulting stochastic simulation algorithm is
investigated and compared with an alternative Monte Carlo wave function method
proposed first by Dalibard et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 68}, 580 (1992)]. By
means of a standard example the suggested algorithm is shown to be more
efficient numerically and to converge faster. Finally, some specific examples
from quantum optics are presented in order to illustrate the proposed method,
such as the coupling of a system to a vacuum, a squeezed vacuum within a finite
solid angle, and a thermal mixture of coherent states.

negative scattering length confined in a harmonic trap. When a realistic non
local (finite range) effective interaction is taken into account, we find that,
besides the known low density metastable solution, a new branch of Bose
condensate appears at higher density. This state is self-bound but its density
can be quite low if the number $N$ of atoms is not too big. The transition
between the two classes of solutions as a function of $N$ can be either sharp
or smooth according to the ratio between the range of the attractive
interaction and the length of the trap. A tight trap leads to a smooth
transition. In addition to the energy and the shape of the cloud we study also
the dynamics of the system. In particular, we study the frequencies of
collective oscillation of the Bose condensate as a function of the number of
atoms both in the local and in the non local case. Moreover, we consider the

For a given bipartite state acting on $C^d\otimes C^d$ we have $f_{max}=
{F_{max}d+1\over d+1}$. We assume completely general teleportation scheme
(trace preserving LQCC action over the pair and the third particle in unknown
state). The proof involves the isomorphism between quantum channels and a class
of bipartite states. We also exploit the technique of $U\otimes U^*$ twirling
states (random application of unitary transformation of the above form) and the
introduced analogous twirling of channels. We illustrate the power of the
theorem by showing that {\it any} bound entangled state does not provide better
fidelity of teleportation than for the purely classical channel. Subsequently,
we apply our tools to the problem of the so-called conclusive teleportation,
then reduced to the question of optimal conclusive increasing of singlet
fraction. We provide an example of state for which Alice and Bob have no chance
to obtain perfect singlet by LQCC action, but still singlet fraction
arbitrarily close to unity can be obtained with nonzero probability. We show
that a slight modification of the state has a threshold for singlet fraction
which cannot be exceeded anymore.

sp-hybridization, and by the Hund-Mulliken molecular-orbit approach which leads
to an extended Hubbard description for the two-dot system that shows a
remarkable dependence on B and a due to the long-range Coulomb interaction. We
find that the exchange J changes sign at a finite field (leading to a

magnetization and the spin susceptibilities of the coupled dots are calculated.
We show that the dephasing due to nuclear spins in GaAs can be strongly

foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) by presenting two local hidden variable
(LHV) rules in the context of the EPRB experiment which violate Bell's
inequality, but which are nevertheless local and deterministic under reasonable
definitions of the terms, and coincide approximately with the conventional QM
prediction. The theories are based on the general idea of probabilistic
detection of particles depending on an interaction of hidden variables within
the measuring device and particle, and relate mathematically to Fourier
analysis. The crucial discrepancy of variations in the hidden variable
distribution based on relative polarizer orientations is isolated which
invalidates assumptions in Bell-type theorems. The first theory can be analyzed
completely symbolically whereas the second was analyzed using numerical
methods. The properties of the second in particular are shown to be
approximately consistent with the reported results and uncertainties in all
three Aspect experiments. Variation in the total photon pairs detected over
orientations is shown to be a basic characteristic of these theories. Some
comments on the relevance of active vs. passive locality are made. Two sections
consider these ideas relative to energy conservation and the measurement
problem (collapse of the wavefunction). One section proposes new experiments.

Kent, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78 (1997) 2874] that
the consistent histories approach allows contrary inferences to be made from
the same data. These inferences correspond to projections $P$ and $Q$,
belonging to different consistent sets, with the properties that $PQ = QP = 0$
and $P \neq 1 -Q$. To many, this seems undesirable in a theory of physical
inferences. It also raises a specific problem for the consistent histories
formalism, since that formalism is set up so as to eliminate contradictory
inferences, i.e. inferences $P$ and $Q$ where $P = 1 - Q$. Yet there seems to
be no sensible physical distinction between contradictory and contrary
inferences.
  It seems particularly hard to defend the asymmetry, since (i) there is a
well-defined quantum histories formalisms which admits both contradictory and
contrary inferences, and (ii) there is also a well-defined formalism, based on
ordered consistent sets of histories, which excludes both.
  In a recent comment, Griffiths and Hartle, while accepting the validity of

information} number to define, meaningfully, a metric on the set of all
possible states of a given quantum system. They showed that the quantum
information is nothing else than the maximal Fisher information in a
measurement of the quantum system, maximized over all possible measurements.
Combining this fact with classical statistical results, they argued that the
quantum information determines the asymptotically optimal rate at which
neighbouring states on some smooth curve can be distinguished, based on
arbitrary measurements on $n$ identical copies of the given quantum system.
  We show that the measurement which maximizes the Fisher information typically
depends on the true, unknown, state of the quantum system. We close the
resulting loophole in the argument by showing that one can still achieve the
same, optimal, rate of distinguishability, by a two stage adaptive measurement
procedure.
  When we consider states lying not on a smooth curve, but on a manifold of
higher dimension, the situation becomes much more complex. We show that the
notion of ``distinguishability of close-by states'' depends strongly on the
measurement resources one allows oneself, and on a further specification of the
task at hand. The quantum information matrix no longer seems to play a central

replaced by controllable SQUIDs. This relaxes the requirements on the time
control and system parameters substantially, and the two-bit coupling can be
switched exactly between zero and a non-zero value for arbitrary pairs. The
phase coherence time is sufficiently long to allow a series of operations.

The
model describing interaction of collection of two-level atoms with a

shown that in the semiclassical limit, in contrast to the regular behaviour,

  Animal Faith</title><description>  We shall argue in this paper that a central piece of modern physics does not
really belong to physics at all but to elementary probability theory. Given a
joint probability distribution J on a set of random variables containing x and
y, define a link between x and y to be the condition x=y on J. Define the {\it
state} D of a link x=y as the joint probability distribution matrix on x and y
without the link. The two core laws of quantum mechanics are the Born
probability rule, and the unitary dynamical law whose best known form is the
Schrodinger's equation. Von Neumann formulated these two laws in the language
of Hilbert space as prob(P) = trace(PD) and D'T = TD respectively, where P is a
projection, D and D' are (von Neumann) density matrices, and T is a unitary
transformation. We'll see that if we regard link states as density matrices,
the algebraic forms of these two core laws occur as completely general theorems
about links. When we extend probability theory by allowing cases to count
negatively, we find that the Hilbert space framework of quantum mechanics
proper emerges from the assumption that all D's are symmetrical in rows and
columns. On the other hand, Markovian systems emerge when we assume that one of
every linked variable pair has a uniform probability distribution. By
representing quantum and Markovian structure in this way, we see clearly both
how they differ, and also how they can coexist in natural harmony with each
other, as they must in quantum measurement, which we'll examine in some detail.
Looking beyond quantum mechanics, we see how both structures have their special
places in a much larger continuum of formal systems that we have yet to look
for in nature.

in a general affine metric space that in the semiclassical approximation would
lead to the autoparallel motion of wave packets, thus providing a deviation of
the spinless particle trajectory from the geodesics in the presence of torsion.
The problem is shown to be equivalent to the inverse problem of the calculus of
variations for the autoparallel motion with additional conditions that the
action (if it exists) has to be invariant under time reparametrizations and
general coordinate transformations, while depending analytically on the torsion
tensor. The problem is proved to have no solution for a generic torsion in
four-dimensional spacetime. A solution exists only if the contracted torsion
tensor is a gradient of a scalar field. The corresponding field theory
describes coupling of matter to the dilaton field.

synchronization preserves Poincar{\'e} covariance but (at least formally)
distinguishes an inertial frame. This enables to avoid the problem of a
noncausal transmision of information related to breaking of the Bell's
inequalities in QM. Our analysis has been focused mainly on the problem of
existence of a proper position operator for massive particles. We have proved
that in our framework such an operator exists for particles with arbitrary
spin. It fulfills all the requirements: it is Hermitean and covariant, it has
commuting components and moreover its eigenvectors (localised states) are also
covariant. We have found the explicit form of the position operator and have
demonstrated that in the preferred frame our operator coincides with the
Newton--Wigner one. We have also defined a covariant spin operator and have
constructed an invariant spin square operator. Moreover, full algebra of
observables consisting of position operators, fourmomentum operators and spin
operators is manifestly Poincar\'e covariant in this framework. Our results
support expectations of other authors (Bell, Eberhard) that a consistent
formulation of quantum mechanics demands existence of a preferred frame.

  equation with reflection</title><description>  Recently it was observed by one of the authors that supersymmetric quantum
mechanics (SUSYQM) admits a formulation in terms of only one bosonic degree of
freedom. Such a construction, called the minimally bosonized SUSYQM, appeared
in the context of integrable systems and dynamical symmetries. We show that the
minimally bosonized SUSYQM can be obtained from Witten's SUSYQM by applying to
it a nonlocal unitary transformation with a subsequent reduction to one of the
eigenspaces of the total reflection operator. The transformation depends on the
parity operator, and the deformed Heisenberg algebra with reflection,
intimately related to parabosons and parafermions, emerges here in a natural
way. It is shown that the minimally bosonized SUSYQM can also be understood as
supersymmetric two-fermion system. With this interpretation, the bosonization
construction is generalized to the case of N=1 supersymmetry in 2 dimensions.
The same special unitary transformation diagonalises the Hamiltonian operator
of the 2D massive free Dirac theory. The resulting Hamiltonian is not a square
root like in the Foldy-Wouthuysen case, but is linear in spatial derivative.
Subsequent reduction to `up' or `down' field component gives rise to a linear
differential equation with reflection whose `square' is the massive
Klein-Gordon equation. In the massless limit this becomes the self-dual Weyl
equation. The linear differential equation with reflection admits
generalizations to higher dimensions and can be consistently coupled to gauge
fields. The bosonized SUSYQM can also be generated applying the nonlocal
unitary transformation to the Dirac field in the background of a nonlinear
scalar field in a kink configuration.

SOM in parallel computing environment. In this model, two separate layers of
neurons are connected together. The number of neurons in both layers and
connections between them is the product of the number of all elements of input
signals and the number of possible classification of the data. With this
structure the conventional repeated learning procedure is modified to learn
just once. The once learning manner is more similar to human learning and
memorizing activities. During training, weight updating is managed through a
sequence of operations among some transformation and operation matrices. Every
connection between neurons of input/output layers is considered as a
independent processor. In this way, all elements of the Euclidean distance
matrix and weight matrix are calculated simultaneously. The minimum distance of
every line of distance matrix can be found by Grover's search algorithm. This
synchronization feature improves the weight updating sequence significantly.
With a typical classification example, the convergence result demonstrates
efficient performance of Parallel-SOM. Theoretic analysis and proofs also show
some important properties of proposed model. Especially, the paper proves that
Parallel-SOM has the same convergence property as Kohonen's SOM, but the
complexity of former is reduced obviously.

temperature is a well-known and well-understood phenomenon. At zero
temperature, even though the thermal fluctuations are absent, quantum fields
still possess vacuum fluctuations. It is then interesting to ask whether a
small particle that is interacting with a quantum field will exhibit Brownian
motion when the quantum field is assumed to be in the vacuum state. In this
paper, we study the cases of a small charge and an imperfect mirror interacting
with a quantum scalar field in (1+1) dimensions. Treating the quantum field as
a classical stochastic variable, we write down a Langevin equation for the
particles. We show that the results we obtain from such an approach agree with
the results obtained from the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Unlike the
finite temperature case, there exists no special frame of reference at zero
temperature and hence it is essential that the particles do not break Lorentz
invariance. We find that that the scalar charge breaks Lorentz invariance,
whereas the imperfect mirror does not. We conclude that small particles such as
the imperfect mirror {\it will} exhibit Brownian motion even in the quantum
vacuum, but this effect can be so small that it may prove to be difficult to
observe it experimentally.

that besides the well-known phonon bottleneck, reducing single-qubit

not be any fundamental dynamical laws. This explains the intrinsic
indeterminism of quantum theory. The probabilities for transition from a given
initial state to a final state then depends on the quantum geometry that is
determined by symmetries, which may exist as relations between states in the
absence of dynamical laws. This enables the experimentally well confirmed
quantum probabilities to be derived from the geometry of Hilbert space, and
gives rise to effective probabilistic laws. An arrow of time which is
consistent with the one given by the second law of thermodynamics, regarded as
an effective law, is obtained. Symmetries are used as the basis for a new
proposed paradigm of physics. This gives rise naturally to the gravitational

procedure for obtaining interactions from any symmetry group.

It is shown to be quite a different quantization way called as a fibre
quantization which leads to an idea on existence of the non-standard dynamical

  All required calculations in the framework of the proposed theory are

(which reduces effectively to a Schrodinger equation with a complex
Hamiltonian) as well as with reference to the microphysical details of a class
of concrete physical realizations. Within the RPI approach it is demonstrated
that for appropriately adjusted fuzziness, information about the evolution of
the state of the system can be read off from the measurement readout E(t). It
is shown furthermore how a measurement of this type may be realized by a series
of weak and short interactions of the two-level system with a quantum
mechanical meter system. After each interaction a macroscopic measuring
apparatus causes the meter to transit into one of two states. The result is
used to generate the energy readout E(t). In this way a complete agreement with

long distances. For distances much longer than the coherence length of a
corresponding noisy quantum channel, the fidelity of transmission is usually so
low that standard purification methods are not applicable. It is however
possible to divide the channel into shorter segments that are purified
separately and then connected by the method of entanglement swapping. This
method can be much more efficient than schemes based on quantum error
correction, as it makes explicit use of two-way classical communication. An
important question is how the noise, introduced by imperfect local operations
(that constitute the protocols of purification and the entanglement swapping),
accumulates in such a compound channel, and how it can be kept below a certain
noise level. To treat this problem, we first study the applicability and the
efficiency of entanglement purification protocols in the situation of imperfect
local operations. We then present a scheme that allows entanglement
purification over arbitrary long channels and tolerates errors on the per-cent
level. It requires a polynomial overhead in time, and an overhead in local
resources that grows only logarithmically with the length of the channel.

  Aspects, and Classical Analogues:</title><description>  In a previous paper, we have proposed assigning as the value of a physical
quantity in quantum theory, a certain kind of set (a sieve) of quantities that
are functions of the given quantity. The motivation was in part physical---such
a valuation illuminates the Kochen-Specker theorem; and in part
mathematical---the valuation arises naturally in the topos theory of
presheaves.
  This paper discusses the conceptual aspects of this proposal. We also
undertake two other tasks. First, we explain how the proposed valuations could
arise much more generally than just in quantum physics; in particular, they
arise as naturally in classical physics. Second, we give another motivation for
such valuations (that applies equally to classical and quantum physics). This
arises from applying to propositions about the values of physical quantities
some general axioms governing partial truth for any kind of proposition.

radiation from a random medium and its scattering matrix S. Familiar results
for black-body radiation are recovered in the limit S to 0. The mean photocount
is proportional to the trace of 1-SS^dagger, in accordance with Kirchhoff's law
relating emissivity and absorptivity. Higher moments of the photocount
distribution are related to traces of powers of 1-SS^dagger, a generalization
of Kirchhoff's law. The theory can be applied to a random amplifying medium (or
&quot;random laser&quot;) below the laser threshold, by evaluating the Bose-Einstein
function at a negative temperature. Anomalously large fluctuations are
predicted in the photocount upon approaching the laser threshold, as a
consequence of overlapping cavity modes with a broad distribution of spectral
widths.

Fourier transform, has been shown to be a powerful tool in developing quantum
algorithms. However, in classical computing there is another class of unitary
transforms, the wavelet transforms, which are every bit as useful as the
Fourier transform. Wavelet transforms are used to expose the multi-scale
structure of a signal and are likely to be useful for quantum image processing
and quantum data compression. In this paper, we derive efficient, complete,
quantum circuits for two representative quantum wavelet transforms, the quantum
Haar and quantum Daubechies $D^{(4)}$ transforms. Our approach is to factor the
operators for these transforms into direct sums, direct products and dot
products of unitary matrices. In so doing, we find that permutation matrices, a
particular class of unitary matrices, play a pivotal role. Surprisingly, we
find that operations that are easy and inexpensive to implement classically are
not always easy and inexpensive to implement quantum mechanically, and vice
versa. In particular, the computational cost of performing certain permutation
matrices is ignored classically because they can be avoided explicitly.
However, quantum mechanically, these permutation operations must be performed
explicitly and hence their cost enters into the full complexity measure of the
quantum transform. We consider the particular set of permutation matrices
arising in quantum wavelet transforms and develop efficient quantum circuits
that implement them. This allows us to design efficient, complete quantum
circuits for the quantum wavelet transform.

formalism. Several possible formalisms are known, defined by different
definitions of event and by different selection criteria for sets of histories.
These formalisms have a natural interpretation, according to which nature
somehow chooses one set of histories from among those allowed, and then
randomly chooses to realise one history from that set; other interpretations
are possible, but their scientific implications are essentially the same.
  The selection criteria proposed to date are reasonably natural, and certainly
raise new questions. For example, the validity of ordering inferences which we
normally take for granted --- such as that a particle in one region is
necessarily in a larger region containing it --- depends on whether or not our
history respects the criterion of ordered consistency, or merely consistency.
  However, the known selection criteria, including consistency and medium
decoherence, are very weak. It is not possible to derive the predictions of
classical mechanics or Copenhagen quantum mechanics from the theories they
define, even given observational data in an extended time interval. Attempts to
refine the consistent histories approach so as to solve this problem by finding
a definition of quasiclassicality have so far not succeeded.
  On the other hand, it is shown that dynamical collapse models, of the type
originally proposed by Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber, can be re-interpreted as set
selection criteria within a quantum histories framework, in which context they
appear as candidate solutions to the set selection problem. This suggests a new
route to relativistic generalisation of these models, since covariant
definitions of a quantum event are known.

distinguishable and the relationship between particle permutation and exchange.
We show that we can always define permutation-symmetric state vectors. When the
particles are completely indistinguishable, then exchange is equivalent to
permutation and therefore the exchange eigenvalue for such
permutation-symmetric state vectors is always +1. Exchange asymmetry arises
when the particles are physically distinguishable, even though otherwise
identical, and can be computed from the transformations that arise when the
distinguishing features are reversed.
  There is a fundamental spatial asymmetry between the relative orientations of
any two vectors in a common frame of reference that persists even in the limit
that the vectors coincide. For a pair of particles this asymmetry between their
spin quantization frames renders them distinguishable even when otherwise
identical. In the conventional construction, this distinction is not properly
accounted for. Particle exchange is then equivalent to reversing this relative
orientation --- which requires a relative rotation by 2pi on the spin
quantization frame of one particle with respect to the other, thus resulting in
the conventional exchange phase.

quantum dots is studied theoretically within the framework of the Hubbard
model. Various values of intra-dot Coulomb repulsion energy $U$ and inter-dot
tunneling energy $V$ are considered, which correspond to various size of the
dots and to various distance between them. In the ground state, the average
value of the spin projection (magnetic moment) at each dot is zero. The input
signal (the local external magnetic field $H$) applied to one of the dots at a
time $t=0$ causes the electronic subsystem to evolve in such a way that
magnetic moments of quantum dots become oriented in the opposite directions at
any time $t&gt;0$. For any set of $U$ and $V$, there exist optimal values of $H$
and $t$ which maximize the absolute values of magnetic moments at both dots,
and magnetic moments become almost saturated. Thus, the antiferromagnetic-like
spin ordering can be realized at the stage of coherent temporal evolution, well
before the relaxation to a new ground state at the sacrifice of inelastic
processes. This effect (&quot;dynamical antiferromagnetism&quot;) may be used for
implementation of a logic function NOT in an extremely short time. A
possibility to use the arrays of quantum dots as high-speed single-electron
devices of new generation is discussed.

simulated efficiently on a computer led to speculation that computation in
general could be done more efficiently if it used quantum effects. This
speculation appeared justified when Peter Shor described a polynomial time
quantum algorithm for factoring integers.
  In quantum systems, the computational space increases exponentially with the
size of the system which enables exponential parallelism. This parallelism
could lead to exponentially faster quantum algorithms than possible
classically. The catch is that accessing the results, which requires
measurement, proves tricky and requires new non-traditional programming
techniques.
  The aim of this paper is to guide computer scientists and other
non-physicists through the conceptual and notational barriers that separate
quantum computing from conventional computing. We introduce basic principles of
quantum mechanics to explain where the power of quantum computers comes from
and why it is difficult to harness. We describe quantum cryptography,
teleportation, and dense coding. Various approaches to harnessing the power of
quantum parallelism are explained, including Shor's algorithm, Grover's
algorithm, and Hogg's algorithms. We conclude with a discussion of quantum

general rotationally invariant potential the angular momentum decomposition
leads to a theory of Jost functions. The anyon statistics parameter gives rise
to an interpolation for angular momenta analogous to the Regge trajectories for
complex angular momenta. Levinson's theorem is adapted to the present context.
In particular we find that in case of a zero energy resonance the statistics
parameter can be determined from the scattering phase.

prescribed at our disposal. The squeezed atom state is a collective atomic
state whose quantum fluctuations in population difference or collective dipole

the photon-number squeezed state and the phase squeezed state, can be produced

quantum-statistical information of the atomic state is faithfully transferred

describe a massive Dirac particle in external vector and scalar fields. Two
different path integral representations for the propagator are derived
systematically without the usual five-dimensional extension and shown to be
equivalent due to the supersymmetry of the action. They correspond to a
projection on the mass of the particle either continuously or at the end of the
time evolution. It is shown that the supersymmetry transformations are
generated by shifting and scaling the supertimes and the invariant difference
of two supertimes is given for the general case. A nonrelativistic reduction of
the relativistic propagator leads to a three-dimensional path integral with the
usual Pauli Hamiltonian. By integrating out the photons we obtain the effective
action for quenched QED and use it to derive the gauge-transformation

source used is imperfect. In this paper we propose and give a concrete design

flux tube, i.e. of zero width, is investigated. Since both a direct approach
based on distribution-valued operators and a limit process starting from a
non-singular flux tube, i.e. of finite size, fail, an alternative method is
applied leading to consistent results. An essential feature is quantum
mechanical supersymmetry at g=2 which imposes, by proper representation, the
correct choice of &quot;boundary conditions&quot;. The corresponding representation of
the Hilbert space in coordinate space differs from the usual space of
square-integrable 2-spinors, entailing other unusual properties. The analysis
is extended to $g\ne 2$ so that supersymmetry is explicitly broken. Finally,
the singular Aharonov-Bohm system with the same amount of singular flux is
analysed by making use of the fact that the Hilbert space must be the same.

be implemented by applying a low-power, monochromatic radio-frequency field to
one peak of a doublet in a weakly-coupled two-spin system. This is known in NMR
spectroscopy as Pound-Overhauser double resonance. The ``transition''
Hamiltonian that has been associated with this procedure is however only an
approximation, which ignores off-resonance effects and does not correctly
predict the associated phase factors. In this paper, the exact effective
Hamiltonian for evolution of the spins' state in a rotating frame is derived,
both under irradiation of a single peak (on-transition) as well as between the
peaks of the doublet (on-resonance). The accuracy of these effective
Hamiltonians is validated by comparing the observable product operator
components of the density matrix obtained by simulation to those obtained by
fitting the corresponding experiments. It is further shown how both the
on-transition and on-resonance fields can be used to implement the
controlled-NOT gate exactly up to conditional phases, and analytic expressions
for these phases are derived. In Appendices, the on-resonance Hamiltonian is
analytically diagonalized, and proofs are given that, in the weak-coupling
approximation, off-resonance effects can be neglected whenever the
radio-frequency field power is small compared to the difference in resonance
frequencies of the two spins.

  from the Quantum HJ Equation</title><description>  A basic aspect of the recently proposed approach to quantum mechanics is that
no use of any axiomatic interpretation of the wave function is made. In
particular, the quantum potential turns out to be an intrinsic potential energy
of the particle, which, similarly to the relativistic rest energy, is never
vanishing. This is related to the tunnel effect, a consequence of the fact that
the conjugate momentum field is real even in the classically forbidden regions.
The quantum stationary Hamilton-Jacobi equation is defined only if the ratio
psi^D/psi of two real linearly independent solutions of the Schroedinger
equation, and therefore of the trivializing map, is a local homeomorphism of
the extended real line into itself, a consequence of the Moebius symmetry of
the Schwarzian derivative. In this respect we prove a basic theorem relating
the request of continuity at spatial infinity of psi^D/psi, a consequence of
the q - 1/q duality of the Schwarzian derivative, to the existence of L^2(R)
solutions of the corresponding Schroedinger equation. As a result, while in the
conventional approach one needs the Schroedinger equation with the L^2(R)
condition, consequence of the axiomatic interpretation of the wave function,
the equivalence principle by itself implies a dynamical equation that does not
need any assumption and reproduces both the tunnel effect and energy
quantization.

coherent cavity field is considered in the framework of the Dicke model. We
focus on the role of collective atomic effects in the phenomenon of collapses
and revivals of the Rabi oscillations. It is shown that the behavior of the
system strongly depends on the initial atomic state. In the case of the initial
half-excited Dicke state we account for a number of interesting phenomena. The
correlations between the atoms result in a suppression of the revival
amplitude, and the revival time is halved, compared to the uncorrelated
fully-excited and ground states. The phenomenon of squeezing of the radiation
field in the atom-field interaction is also discussed. For the initial
fully-excited and ground atomic states, the field is squeezed on the short-time
scale, and squeezing can be enhanced by increasing the number of atoms. Some
empirical formulas are found which describe the behavior of the system in
excellent agreement with numerical results. For the half-excited Dicke state,
the field can be strongly squeezed on the long-time scale in the case of two
atoms. This kind of squeezing is enhanced by increasing the intensity of the
initial coherent field and is of the same nature as revival-time squeezing in
the Jaynes-Cummings model. The appearance of this long-time squeezing can be
explained using the factorization approximation for semiclassical atomic
states.

connected by a coordinate transformation to the free one with vanishing energy,
univocally leads to the Quantum Stationary HJ Equation (QSHJE). Trajectories
depend on the Planck length through hidden variables which arise as initial
conditions. The formulation has manifest p-q duality, a consequence of the
involutive nature of the Legendre transform and of its recently observed
relation with second-order linear differential equations. This reflects in an
intrinsic psi^D-psi duality between linearly independent solutions of the
Schroedinger equation. Unlike Bohm's theory, there is a non-trivial action even
for bound states. No use of any axiomatic interpretation of the wave-function
is made. Tunnelling is a direct consequence of the quantum potential which
differs from the usual one and plays the role of particle's self-energy. The
QSHJE is defined only if the ratio psi^D/psi is a local self-homeomorphism of
the extended real line. This is an important feature as the L^2 condition,
which in the usual formulation is a consequence of the axiomatic interpretation
of the wave-function, directly follows as a basic theorem which only uses the
geometrical gluing conditions of psi^D/psi at q=\pm\infty as implied by the EP.
As a result, the EP itself implies a dynamical equation that does not require
any further assumption and reproduces both tunnelling and energy quantization.
Several features of the formulation show how the Copenhagen interpretation
hides the underlying nature of QM. Finally, the non-stationary higher
dimensional quantum HJ equation and the relativistic extension are derived.

two-slit experiment, which implicitly assumes (as in the demonstration of the

paper shows that this assumption is not indispensable. Abandoning the
assumption allows to develop an ontology where particle motion is described by
classical paths and quantum phenomena are interpreted as a manifestation of a
contingent law, i.e., of a law deriving from the boundary conditions of the
universe, such as the second law of thermodynamics. The paper also proposes an
equation having a typical quantum-like structure to represent the contingent
laws of the universe.

A corresponding theory of the isothermal Brownian motion of particle ensembles

of local expectation values we elevate the individually negligible phenomena to
a non-negligible (accumulated) recoil effect on the ensemble average. The main

  It is argued that the Sturmian method amounts to a non-perturbative

mechanics. Ordinarily, one imposes the condition $H^\dagger=H$ on the
Hamiltonian, where $\dagger$ represents the mathematical operation of complex
conjugation and matrix transposition. This conventional Hermiticity condition
is sufficient to ensure that the Hamiltonian $H$ has a real spectrum. However,
replacing this mathematical condition by the weaker and more physical
requirement $H^\ddag=H$, where $\ddag$ represents combined parity reflection
and time reversal ${\cal PT}$, one obtains new classes of complex Hamiltonians
whose spectra are still real and positive. This generalization of Hermiticity
is investigated using a complex deformation $H=p^2+x^2(ix)^\epsilon$ of the
harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian, where $\epsilon$ is a real parameter. The
system exhibits two phases: When $\epsilon\geq0$, the energy spectrum of $H$ is
real and positive as a consequence of ${\cal PT}$ symmetry. However, when
$-1&lt;\epsilon&lt;0$, the spectrum contains an infinite number of complex
eigenvalues and a finite number of real, positive eigenvalues because ${\cal
PT}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken. The phase transition that occurs at
$\epsilon=0$ manifests itself in both the quantum-mechanical system and the
underlying classical system. Similar qualitative features are exhibited by
complex deformations of other standard real Hamiltonians
$H=p^2+x^{2N}(ix)^\epsilon$ with $N$ integer and $\epsilon&gt;-N$; each of these
complex Hamiltonians exhibits a phase transition at $\epsilon=0$. These ${\cal
PT}$-symmetric theories may be viewed as analytic continuations of conventional
theories from real to complex phase space.

emphasis on the deformed oscillator subalgebras and the generalized
representations of the Wigner function. These subalgebras are shown to be
admissible endowed with the non-negative norm of Hilbert space vectors. Hence,
they provide the desired canonical basis for the algebraic formulation of the
quantum phase problem. Certain equivalence classes in the space of labels are
identified within each subalgebra, and connections with area-preserving
canonical transformations are examined. The generalized representations of the
Wigner function are examined in the finite-dimensional cyclic Schwinger basis.
These representations are shown to conform to all fundamental conditions of the
generalized phase space Wigner distribution. As a specific application of the
Schwinger basis, the number-phase unitary operator pair in ${\ee Z}_{D} \times
{\ee Z}_{D}$ is studied and, based on the admissibility of the underlying

must satisfy Bloch boundary conditions (BCs) on a torus and the spectrum
consists of a finite number of levels for given BCs. As the BCs are varied, a
level broadens into a band. The BHD for a band is defined as the uniform
average of the Husimi distributions for all the eigenstates in the band. The
generalized BHD for a set of adjacent bands is the average of the BHDs
associated with these bands. BHDs are shown to be closer, in several aspects,
to classical distributions than Husimi distributions for individual
eigenstates. The generalized BHD for two adjacent bands is shown to be
approximately conserved in the passage through a degeneracy between the bands
as a nonintegrability parameter is varied. Finally, it is shown how generalized
BHDs can be defined so as to achieve physical continuity under small variations
of the scaled Planck constant. A generalization of the topological

The evolution operator for an arbitrary number of periods of the external field

determine the crossover from purely quantum diffusion to a diffusion which is
the quantum manifestation of classical diffusion along the stochastic web. This

localization length of the QE states on the wave amplitude. The width of the

particular, and in contrast to the earlier bounds, the new bound is not
additive in general. We give an example of a state for which the bound fails to
be additive, as well as a number of states for which the bound is additive.

diagonalize it using different variants of flow equations, a method of

  corrections to the Lorentz-Lorenz formula</title><description>  Generalized single-atom Maxwell-Bloch equations for optically dense media are
derived taking into account non-cooperative radiative atom-atom interactions.
Applying a Gaussian approximation and formally eliminating the degrees of
freedom of the quantized radiation field and of all but a probe atom leads to
an effective time-evolution operator for the probe atom. The mean coherent
amplitude of the local field seen by the atom is shown to be given by the
classical Lorentz-Lorenz relation. The second-order correlations of the field
lead to terms that describe relaxation or pump processes and level shifts due
to multiple scattering or reabsorption of spontaneously emitted photons. In the
Markov limit a nonlinear and nonlocal single-atom density matrix equation is
derived. To illustrate the effects of the quantum corrections we discuss
amplified spontaneous emission and radiation trapping in a dense ensemble of
initially inverted two-level atoms and the effects of radiative interactions on
intrinsic optical bistability in coherently driven systems.

study two different Markovian approaches to the quantum dynamics of a
periodically driven system with dissipation. In the simpler approach, the
driving enters the master equation for the reduced density operator only in the
Hamiltonian term. An improved master equation is achieved by treating the
entire driven system within the Floquet formalism and coupling it to the
reservoir as a whole. The different ensuing evolution equations are compared in
various representations, particularly as Fokker-Planck equations for the Wigner
function. On all levels of approximation, these evolution equations retain the
periodicity of the driving, so that their solutions have Floquet form and
represent eigenfunctions of a non-unitary propagator over a single period of
the driving. We discuss asymptotic states in the long-time limit as well as the
conservative and the high-temperature limits. Numerical results obtained within
the different Markov approximations are compared with the exact path-integral
solution. The application of the improved Floquet-Markov scheme becomes
increasingly important when considering stronger driving and lower

down-conversion from an initial sub-harmonic vacuum (spontaenous
down-conversion). Standard linearization of the Heisenberg equations of motions
fails in this case, since it is based on an expansion around an unstable
classical solution and neglects pump depletion. Introducing a mean-field
approximation we find a periodic exchange of energy between the pump and
subharmonic mode goverened by an anharmonic pendulum equation. From this
equation the optimum interaction time or crystal length for maximum conversion
can be determined. A numerical integration of the 2-mode Schr&quot;odinger equation
using a dynamically optimized basis of displaced and squeezed number states
verifies the characteristic times predicted by the mean-field approximation. In
contrast to semiclassical and mean-field predictions it is found that quantum
fluctuations of the pump mode lead to a substantial limitation of the

experiments for discovering the non-trivial global topology of the universe. To
evaluate the CMB anisotropy in multiply-connected compact cosmological models,
one needs to compute the eigenmodes of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Using the
direct boundary element method, we numerically obtain the low-lying eigenmodes
on a compact hyperbolic 3-space called the Thurston manifold which is the
second smallest in the known compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds. The computed
eigenmodes are expanded in terms of eigenmodes on the unit three-dimensional
pseudosphere. We numerically find that the expansion coefficients behave as
Gaussian pseudo-random numbers for low-lying eigenmodes. The observed
gaussianity in the CMB fluctuations can partially be attributed to the Gaussian
pseudo-randomness of the expansion coefficients assuming that the Gaussian
pseudo-randomness is the universal property of the compact hyperbolic spaces.

In the
case of ideal experiments, this inequality is equivalent to Bell's original
inequality of 1965 which, as is well known, is violated by a maximum factor of
1.5. The crucial point is that even in the case of real experiments where
polarizers and detectors are non-ideal, the present inequality is violated by a
factor of 1.5, whereas previous inequalities such as Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality of 1969 and Clauser-Horne inequality of 1974 are violated by a
factor of $\sqrt 2$. The larger magnitude of violation can be of importance for
the experimental test of locality. Moreover, the supplementary assumption used
to derive this inequality is weaker than Garuccio-Rapisarda assumption. Thus an
experiment based on this inequality refutes a larger family of hidden variable
theories than an experiment based on Garuccio-Rapisarda inequality.

general ``reference'' model for one-mode systems is developed in which the
dynamic aspects of the problem are not contaminated by static contributions

general criteria to optimize the noise suppression performance. With respect to
the squeezing in the fundamental mode the optimum working point is located near
the first turning point of the dispersive bistability induced by cascading of
the second order nonlinear response. The nonlinearities induced by conventional

the escape efficiency of the cavity. In the case of the harmonic mode both,
finite phase mismatch and/or harmonic mode driving allow for an optimum dynamic
response of the system something not possible in the standard phase matched
Second Harmonic Generation. The squeezing is then limited by the losses in the
harmonic mode, allowing for very high degrees of squeezing because of the
non-resonant nature of the mode. This opens the possibility of very high
performances using artificial materials with resonantly enhanced
nonlinearities. It is also shown how it is possible to substantially increase
the noise reduction and at the same time to more than double the output power
for parameters corresponding to reported experiments.

``natural measure'' on the N-dimensional quantum systems (quant-ph/9804024),
but expressed surprise when it led them to conclude that for N = 2 x 2,
disentangled (separable) systems are more probable (0.632) in nature than
entangled ones. We contend, however, that ZHSL's (rejected) intuition has, in
fact, a sound theoretical basis, and that the a priori probability of
disentangled 2 x 2 systems should more properly be viewed as (considerably)
less than 0.5. We arrive at this conclusion in two quite distinct ways, the
first based on classical and the second, quantum considerations. Both
approaches, however, replace (in whole or part) the ZHSL (product) measure by
ones based on the volume elements of monotone metrics, which in the classical
case amounts to adopting the Jeffreys' prior of Bayesian theory. Only the
quantum-theoretic analysis (which yields the smallest probabilities of
disentanglement) uses the minimum number of parameters possible, N^2 - 1, as
opposed to N^2 + N - 1 (although this &quot;over-parameterization&quot;, as recently
indicated by Byrd, should be avoidable). However, despite substantial
computation, we are not able to obtain precise estimates of these
probabilities, and the need for additional (possibly supercomputer) analyses is
indicated (particularly so, for higher-dimensional quantum systems, such as the
2 x 3 we also study here).

events localised in space-time while the clocks used for time definition and
the fields used in synchronisation or localisation procedures are necessarily
quantum systems.
  We outline an algebraic framework where basic requirements of quantum theory
and relativity are consistently dealt with. This approach which may be termed
as a `quantum relativity' is built on the algebra of symmetries. It contains
the definition of quantum observables associated with Einstein localisation in
space-time as well as the evaluation of their commutation relations including
the energy-time relation. These commutators also describe the relativistic
shifts undergone under frame transformations, not only for inertial frames but
also for uniformly accelerated frames. The quantum redshift laws differ from
their classical counterparts while still obeying universal metric properties.
  The paper presents this approach in terms closely connected to the seminal
Einstein conception of localisation in space-time and refers to already
published papers for more technical developments.

consequence of a (stochastic) choice (change) of Time. Therefore, each single
object experiences its own (local), stochastically chosen Time, which is as
real for it, as the macroscopic Time is real in classical physics. Therefore,
instead of the &quot;indeterminism&quot; with regard to the macroscopic Time, MTI
proposes &quot;determinism&quot;, but with regard to the set(s) of (stochastically
chosen) local Times. Within an axiomatization, which includes the composite
system &quot;single object+apparatus+environment, MTI leads to : (i) Recognizing the
amplification process as the fundamental &quot;part&quot; of the measurement process,
(ii) Nonvalidity of the Schrodinger equation concerning the &quot;whole&quot;, O+A+E,
which makes the &quot;state reduction process&quot; unnecessary and unphysical, (iii)
Natural deducibility of the macroscopic irreversibility, and (iv)
Nonequivalence of MTI with any existing measurement theory, or interpretation.
Thus, within MTI, the measurement problem reduces basically onto the search for
quantum effect, which would allow forthe local, stochastic change of Time.

in binary quantum communication channels, (2) the tradeoff between information
gain and state disturbance for two prescribed states, and (3) the quantitative
clonability of those states. Each topic in its own way quantifies the extent to
which two states are ``quantum'' with respect to each other, i.e., the extent
to which the two together violate some classical precept. It is suggested that
even toy examples such as these hold some promise for shedding light on the
foundations of quantum theory.

  Gravity</title><description>  A theory recently proposed by the author aims to explain decoherence and the
thermodynamical behaviour of closed systems within a conservative, unitary,
framework for quantum gravity by assuming that the operators tied to the
gravitational degrees of freedom are unobservable and equating physical entropy
with matter-gravity entanglement entropy. Here we obtain preliminary results on
the extent of decoherence this theory predicts. We treat first a static state
which, if one were to ignore quantum gravitational effects, would be a quantum
superposition of two spatially displaced states of a single classically well
describable ball of uniform mass density in empty space. Estimating the quantum
gravitational effects on this system within a simple Newtonian approximation,
we obtain formulae which predict e.g. that as long as the mass of the ball is
considerably larger than the Planck mass, such a would-be-coherent static
superposition will actually be decohered whenever the separation of the centres
of mass of the two ball-states excedes a small fraction (which decreases as the
mass of the ball increases) of the ball radius. We then obtain a formula for
the quantum gravitational correction to the would-be-pure density matrix of a
non-relativistic many-body Schroedinger wave function and argue that this
formula predicts decoherence between configurations which differ (at least) in
the &quot;relocation&quot; of a cluster of particles of Planck mass. We estimate the
entropy of some simple model closed systems, finding a tendency for it to
increase with &quot;matter-clumping&quot; suggestive of a link with existing
phenomenological discussions of cosmological entropy increase.

system does not change the classical equation of motion. Based on the

calculated from the classical action, in terms of solutions of the classical
equation of motion: two homogeneous and one particular solutions. The kernels

matter by considering constraints to be the limits of large restoring forces as
the constraint coordinates deviate from their constrained values. We find
additional ambiguous terms of order hbar^2 involving freedom in the
constraining potentials, demonstrating that the classical constrained
Hamiltonian or Lagrangian cannot uniquely specify the quantization: the
ambiguity of directly quantizing a constrained system is inherently
unresolvable. However, there is never any problem with a physical quantum
system, which cannot have infinite constraint forces and always fluctuates
around the mean constraint values. The issue is addressed from the perspectives
of adiabatic approximations in quantum mechanics, Feynman path integrals, and
semiclassically in terms of adiabatic actions.

the possibility of bypassing this condition and thereby creating coherences by
letting the atom with orthogonal dipoles to interact with the vacuum of a

  photons</title><description>  Bell's theorem of 1965 is a proof that all realistic interpretations of
quantum mechanics must be non-local. Bell's theorem consists of two parts:
first a correlation inequality is derived that must be satisfied by all local
realistic theories; second it is demonstrated that quantum mechanical
probabilities violate this inequality in certain cases. In the case of ideal
experiments, Bell's theorem has been proven. However, in the case of real
experiments where polarizers and detectors are non-ideal, the theorem has not
yet been proven since the proof always requires some arbitrary and {\em ad hoc}
supplementary assumptions. In this paper, we state a new and rather weak
supplementary assumption for the ensemble of photons that emerge from the
polarizers, and we show that the conjunction of Einstein's locality with this
assumption leads to validity of an inequality that is violated by a factor as
large as 1.5 in the case of real experiments. Moreover, the present
supplementary assumption is considerably weaker and more general than Clauser,
Horne, Shimony, Holt supplementary assumption.

  Quantum Theory</title><description>  Feynman's path integrals provide a hidden variable description of quantum
mechanics (and quantum field theories). The time evolution kernel is unitary in
Minkowski time, but generically it becomes real and non-negative in Euclidean
time. It follows that the entangled state correlations, that violate Bell's
inequalities in Minkowski time, obey the inequalities in Euclidean time. This
observation emphasises the link between violation of Bell's inequalities in
quantum mechanics and unitarity of the theory. Search for an evolution kernel
that cannot be conveniently made non-negative leads to effective interactions
that violate time reversal invariance. Interactions giving rise to geometric
phases in the effective description of the theory, such as the anomalous
Wess-Zumino interactions, have this feature. I infer that they must be present
in any set-up that produces entangled states violating Bell's inequalities.
Such interactions would be a crucial ingredient in a quantum computer.

driven doublet of potentially closely spaced excited states to a common ground
level. Multiple interference mechanisms are identified which may lead to
fluorescence inhibition in well-separated regions of the spectrum or act
jointly in cancelling the spontaneous emission. In addition to phase
independent quantum interferences due to combined absorptions and emissions of
driving field photons, we distinguish two competing phase dependent
interference mechanisms as means of controlling the fluorescence. The
indistinguishable quantum paths may involve the spontaneous emission from the
same state of the doublet, originating from the two different components of the
initial coherent superposition. Alternatively the paths involve a different
spontaneous photon from each of two decaying states, necessarily with the same
polarization. This makes these photons indistinguishable in principle within
the uncertainty of the two decay rates. The phase dependence arises for both
mechanisms because the interfering paths differ by an unequal number of
stimulated absorptions and emissions of the microwave field photons.

to justify the mathematical formalism on the basis of three main assumptions:
the first defines the subject matter, the second introduces amplitudes as the
tools for quantitative reasoning, and the third is an interpretative rule that
provides the link to the prediction of experimental outcomes. In this work we
introduce a natural and compelling fourth assumption: if there is no reason to
prefer one region of the configuration space over another then they should be
`weighted' equally. This is the last ingredient necessary to introduce a unique
inner product in the linear space of wave functions. Thus, a form of the
principle of insufficient reason is implicit in the Hilbert inner product.
Armed with the inner product we obtain two results. First, we elaborate on an
earlier proof of the Born probability rule. The implicit appeal to insufficient
reason shows that quantum probabilities are not more objective than classical
probabilities. Previously we had argued that the consistent manipulation of
amplitudes leads to a linear time evolution; our second result is that time
evolution must also be unitary. The argument is straightforward and hinges on
the conservation of entropy. The only subtlety consists of defining the correct
entropy; it is the array entropy, not von Neumann's. After unitary evolution
has been established we proceed to introduce the useful notion of observables
and we explore how von Neumann's entropy can be linked to Shannon's information
theory. Finally, we discuss how various connections among the postulates of
quantum theory are made explicit within this approach.

Einstein's `hole argument' -- that underpin Penrose's proposal for
gravitationally induced quantum state reduction, the proposal is constructively
criticised. Penrose has suggested a mechanism for objective reduction of
quantum states with postulated collapse time T = h/E, where E is an
ill-definedness in the gravitational self-energy stemming from the profound
conflict between the principles of superposition and general covariance. Here
it is argued that, even if Penrose's overall conceptual scheme for the
breakdown of quantum mechanics is unreservedly accepted, his formula for the
collapse time of superpositions reduces to T --&gt; oo (E --&gt; 0) in the strictly
Newtonian regime, which is the domain of his proposed experiment to corroborate
the effect. A suggestion is made to rectify this situation. In particular,
recognising the cogency of Penrose's reasoning in the domain of full `quantum
gravity', it is demonstrated that an appropriate experiment which could in
principle corroborate his argued `macroscopic' breakdown of superpositions is
not the one involving non-rotating mass distributions as he has suggested, but
a Leggett-type SQUID or BEC experiment involving superposed mass distributions
in relative rotation. The demonstration thereby brings out one of the
distinctive characteristics of Penrose's scheme, rendering it empirically
distinguishable from other state reduction theories involving gravity. As an
aside, a new geometrical measure of gravity-induced deviation from quantum
mechanics in the manner of Penrose is proposed, but now for the canonical
commutation relations [Q, P] = ih.

frequency of some unperturbed electromagnetic mode: $\omega_w=p(\pi
c/L_0)(1+\delta)$, $|\delta|\ll 1$, (p=1,2,...). An explicit analytical
expression for the total energy in all the modes shows an exponential growth if
$|\delta|$ is less than the dimensionless amplitude of vibrations $\epsilon\ll

of photon generation from vacuum in the (j+ps)th mode goes asymptotically to a
constant value $cp^2\sin^2(\pi j/p)\sqrt{\epsilon^2-\delta^2}/[\pi L_0
(j+ps)]$, the numbers of photons in the modes with indices p,2p,3p,... being

  Thermodynamics of nonrelativistic vaccum</title><description>  The problem of random motion of 1D quantum reactive harmonic oscillator
(QRHO) is formulated in terms of a wave functional regarded as a complex
probability process in an extended space. In the complex stochastic
differential equation (SDE) for this process the variables are separated with
the help of the Langevin-type model SDE introduced in the functional space. The
complete positive Fokker-Plank measure of the functional space is obtained. The
average wave function of roaming QRHO is obtained by means of functional
integration over the process with the complete Fokker-Plank measure in the
functional space. The local and averaged transition matrices of roaming QRHO
were constructed. The thermodynamics of nonrelativistic vacuum is investigated
in detail and expressions for the internal energy, Helmholtzian energy and
entropy are obtained. The oscillator's ground state energy, its shift and
broadening are calculated.

a conductance which becomes smaller by the factor 1/2 ~ 1/3 from that of the
clean nanotube. This decrease mainly comes from lattice fluctuations of the

suppression of electronic conductance around the Fermi energy due to disorder

Recent years have witnessed a significant growth of activity in this field of

the propagation of light in a constant homogeneous magnetic field and in a
Casimir vacuum. The latter appears to be particularly interesting because the
Casimir vacuum has been found to exhibit modes of the propagation of light with
phase and group velocities larger than c in the low frequency domain omega&lt;&lt;m
where m is the electron mass. The impact of this result on the front velocity

indeterminacy with respect to the predicate, in the sense that the vagueness
concerns whether a well-determined object satisfies it or not, in the case of
opaque predicates the indeterminacy is with regard to the objects which should
satisfy them. In other words, their extensions are not well-defined, despite
the fact that the conditions for an object to satisfy the predicates are
well-known. We suggest that such opaque predicates (and more generally, what we
call opaque relations) can be characterized by a logic which encompasses a
semantics founded in quasi-set theory, and call their extensions veiled sets.

nano-electronic devices appear most suitable for large-scale integration and
potential applications. We suggest to use low-capacitance Josephson junctions,
exploiting the coherence of tunneling in the superconducting state combined
with the possibility to control individual charges by Coulomb blockade effects
(cond-mat/9706016,cond-mat/9808067). These systems constitute quantum bits,
with logical states differing by one Cooper-pair charge. Single- and two-bit
operations can be performed by applying a sequence of gate voltages. The phase
coherence time is sufficiently long to allow a series of these steps. In
addition to the manipulation of qubits the resulting quantum state has to be
read out. This can be accomplished by coupling a single-electron transistor
capacitively to the qubit (cond-mat/9801125). To describe this quantum
measurement process we study the time evolution of the density matrix of the
coupled system. Only when a transport voltage is turned on, the transistor
destroys the phase coherence of the qubit; in this case within a short time.
The measurement is accomplished after a longer time scale, when the signal
resolves the different quantum states. At still longer times the measurement
process itself destroys the information about the initial state. We present a
suitable set of system parameters, which can be realized by present-day
technology.

noise as a readout system for the intra-cavity intensity fluctuations.

down-conversion light source, which produced correlated, but random, emissions
of photon pairs. The two photons of a given pair were emitted in slightly
different directions so that one photon passed through the tunnel barrier,
while the other photon passed through the vacuum. The time delay for the
tunneling photon relative to its twin was measured by adjusting the path length
difference between the two photons in a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer, in order

(Bennett 1995, Preskill 1998). One of the most unexpected is a procedure called
quantum teleportation (Bennett et al 1993) that allows the quantum state of a
system to be transported from one location to another, without moving through
the intervening space. Partial implementations of teleportation (Bouwmeester et
al 1997, Boschi et al 1998) over macroscopic distances have been achieved using
optical systems, but omit the final stage of the teleportation procedure. Here
we report an experimental implementation of the full quantum teleportation
operation over inter-atomic distances using liquid state nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR). The inclusion of the final stage enables for the first time a
teleportation implementation which may be used as a subroutine in larger
quantum computations, or for quantum communication. Our experiment also
demonstrates the use of quantum process tomography, a procedure to completely
characterize the dynamics of a quantum system. Finally, we demonstrate a

in this work. We found a shape parameter Hamiltonian expansion which enables us
to obtain the spectrum of the deformed billiard for deformations so large as
the characteristic wave length. Then, for a specified time dependent shape
variation, the quantum dynamics of a particle inside the billiard is integrated
directly. In particular, the dispersion of the energy is studied in the
Bunimovich stadium billiard with oscillating boundary. The results showed that
the distribution of energy spreads diffusively for the first oscillations of
the boundary (${&lt; \Delta^2 E}&gt; =2 D t$). We studied the diffusion contant $D$
as a function of the boundary velocity and found differences with theoretical
predictions based on random matrix theory. By extracting highly phase space
localized structures from the spectrum, previous differences were reduced
significantly. This fact provides the first numerical evidence of the influence
of phase space localization on the quantum diffusion of a chaotic system.

in any attempt to quantify the degree of entanglement in the state of a
multipartite quantum system. These measures can be regarded as generalizations
of the classical Shannon-Wiener information of a probability distribution into
the quantum regime. In the present work we introduce a previously unknown
approach to the Shannon-Wiener information which provides an intuitive
interpretation for its functional form as well as putting all entanglement
measures with a similar structure into a new context: By formalizing the
process of information gaining in a set-theoretical language we arrive at a
mathematical structure which we call ''tree structures'' over a given set. On
each tree structure, a tree function can be defined, reflecting the degree of
splitting and branching in the given tree. We show in detail that the
minimization of the tree function on, possibly constrained, sets of tree
structures renders the functional form of the Shannon-Wiener information. This
finding demonstrates that entropy-like information measures may themselves be
understood as the result of a minimization process on a more general underlying
mathematical structure, thus providing an entirely new interpretational
framework to entropy-like measures of information and entanglement. We suggest
three natural axioms for defining tree structures, which turn out to be related
to the axioms describing neighbourhood topologies on a topological space. The
same minimization that renders the functional form of the Shannon-Wiener
information from the tree function then assigns a preferred topology to the
underlying set, hinting at a deep relation between entropy-like measures and
neighbourhood topologies.

bosons confined in a leaky box, when its number fluctuation is initially (t=0)
suppressed. We take account of quantum fluctuations of all modes, including k =
0. We identify a ``natural coordinate'' b_0 of the interacting bosons, by which
many physical properties can be simply described. Using b_0, we successfully
define the cosine and sine operators for interacting many bosons. The
wavefunction, which we call the ``number state of interacting bosons'' (NSIB),
of the ground state that has a definite number N of interacting bosons can be
represented simply as a number state of b_0. We evaluate the time evolution of
the reduced density operator \rho(t) of the bosons in the box with a finite
leakage flux J, in the early time stage for which Jt &lt;&lt; N. It is shown that
\rho(t) evolves from a single NSIB at t = 0, into a classical mixture of NSIBs
of various values of N at t &gt; 0. We define a new state called the
``number-phase squeezed state of interacting bosons'' (NPIB). It is shown that
\rho(t) for t&gt;0 can be rewritten as the phase-randomized mixture (PRM) of
NPIBs. It is also shown that the off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) and the
order parameter defined by it do not distinguish the NSIB and NPIB. On the
other hand, the other order parameter \Psi, defined as the expectation value of
the boson operator, has different values among these states. For each element
of the PRM of NPIBs, we show that \Psi evolves from zero to a finite value very
quickly. Namely, after the leakage of only two or three bosons, each element
acquires a full, stable and definite (non-fluctuating) value of \Psi.

with surroundings. Based on $\hbar$-scaling of an equation for time evolution
of the Wigner's quasi-probability distribution function in presence of
dissipation and thermal diffusion we derive a semiclassical equation for
quantum fluctuations. This identifies an early regime of evolution dominated by
fluctuations in the curvature of the potential due to classical chaos and
dissipation. A stochastic treatment of this classical fluctuations leads us to
a Fokker-Planck equation which is reminiscent of Kramers' equation for
thermally activated processes. This reveals an interplay of three aspects of
evolution of quantum noise in weakly dissipative open systems; the reversible
Liouville flow, the irreversible chaotic diffusion which is characteristic of
the system itself, and irreversible dissipation induced by the external
reservoir. It has been demonstrated that in the dissipation-free case a
competition between Liouville flow in the contracting direction of phase space
and chaotic diffusion sets a critical width in the Wigner function for quantum
fluctuations. We also show how the initial quantum noise gets amplified by
classical chaos and ultimately equilibrated under the influence of dissipation.
We establish that there exists a critical limit to the expansion of phase
space. The limit is determined by chaotic diffusion and dissipation. Making use
of appropriate quantum-classical correspondence we verify the semiclassical
analysis by the fully quantum simulation in a chaotic quartic oscillator.

renormalization group methods to remove secular terms from the perturbation
series, give the opportunity of a full study of the solution of the
Schr\&quot;{o}dinger equation in different ranges of the parameters of the given
hamiltonian. In view of recent experiments with strong laser fields, this
approach seems well-suited to give a clarification and an improvement of the
applications of the dressed states as currently done through the eigenstates of
the atom-field interaction, showing that these are just the leading order of
the dual Dyson series when the Hamiltonian is expressed in the interaction
picture. In order to exploit the method at the best, a study is accomplished of
the well-known Jaynes-Cummings model in the rotating wave approximation, whose
exact solution is known, comparing the perturbative solutions obtained by the
Dyson series and its dual with the same approximations obtained by Taylor
expanding the exact solution. Finally, a full perturbative study of high-order
harmonic generation is given obtaining, through analytical expressions, a clear
account of the power spectrum using a two-level model, even if the method can
be successfully applied to a more general model that can account for ionization
too. The analysis shows that to account for the power spectrum it is needed to
go to first order in the perturbative analysis. The spectrum obtained gives a
way to measure experimentally the shift of the energy levels of the atom
interacting with the laser field by looking at the shifting of hyper-Raman
lines.

here ascribed to their non-mechanistic character, which becomes evident by
joining the notions of entanglement and quantum measurement. Measurement
analogically sets a (partial) constraint on the output of the computation of a
hard-to-reverse function. This constraint goes back in time along the
reversible computation process, computing the reverse function, which yields
quantum efficiency. The evolution, comprising wave function collapse (here a
revamped notion), is non-mechanistic as it is driven by both an initial
condition and a final constraint. It seems that the more the output is
constrained by measurement, the higher can be the efficiency. Setting a
complete constraint, by means of a special Zeno effect, yields (speculatively)
NP-complete=P.

gas is examined and nonlinear operator equations for the motion of the center
of mass of the atoms are derived. The goal is to present a self-consistent set
of coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations for atomic and electromagnetic fields
generalized to include the atomic center-of-mass motion. Two effects are
considered: The ultracold gas forms a medium for the Maxwell field which
modifies its propagation properties. Combined herewith is the influence of the
dipole-dipole interaction between atoms which leads to a density dependent
shift of the atomic transition frequency. It is expressed in a position
dependent detuning and is the reason for the nonlinearity. This results in a
direct and physically transparent way from the quantum field theoretical
version of the local-field approach to electrodynamics in quantum media. The
equations for the matter fields are general. Previously published nonlinear
equations are obtained as limiting cases. As an atom optical application the
scattering of a dense beam of a Bose gas is studied in the Raman-Nath regime.
The main conclusion is that for increasing density of the gas the dipole-dipole
interaction suppresses or enhances the scattering depending on the sign of the
detuning.

based on the uncertainty relation with his interpretation, was the origin of
the Copenhagen interpretation and is still widely adopted, but is shown to be
not consistent with the quantum mechanical view. We point out that in most of
these gedanken experiments, entanglement plays a crucial role, while its
buildup does not change the uncertainty of the concerned quantity in the way
thought by Bohr. Especially, in the gamma ray microscope and recoiling
double-slit gedanken experiments, we expose the entanglement based on momentum
exchange. It is shown that even in such cases, the loss of interference is only
due to the entanglement with other degrees of freedom, while the uncertainty
relation argument, which has not been questioned up to now, is not right.

  Completeness in Quantum Mechanics</title><description>  Besides their use for efficient computation, quantum computers are a base for
studying quantum systems that create valid physical theories using mathematics
and physics. An essential part of the validation process for quantum mechanics
is the development of a coherent theory of mathematics and quantum mechanics
together. Such a theory should combine mathematical logical concepts with
quantum mechanics. That this might be possible is shown here by defining truth,
validity, consistency, and completeness for a quantum mechanical version of a
simple classical expression enumeration machine described by Smullyan. It is
seen that for an interpretation based on a Feynman path sum over expression
path states, truth, consistency, and completeness have different properties
than for the classical system. For instance the truth of a sentence S is
defined only on the paths containing S. It is undefined elsewhere. Also S and
its negation can both be true provided they appear on separate paths. This
satisfies the definition of consistency. It is seen that validity and
completeness connect the system dynamics to the truth of the sentences. It is
proved that validity implies consistency. The requirements of validity and
maximal completeness strongly restrict the possible dynamics of the system.
Aspects of the existence of a valid, maximally complete dynamics are discussed.
An exponentially efficient quantum computer is described that is also valid and
complete.

this interaction is to produce decoherence within the wavepackets which could
be accessible in experiments at the atomic scale.
  Using a simple model for the coherence properties of the gravitational field

source of spacetime fluctuations for detection are the above zero-point energy
fluctuations. According to our model, the absence of intrinsic irremoveable

for nonadiabatic transitions $P$. By using the Dykhne-Davis-Pechukas formula,
we derive simple analytic estimates for $P$ for two types of nonlinear
crossings. In the first type, the nonlinearity in the detuning appears as a
{\it perturbative} correction to the dominant linear time dependence. Then
appreciable deviations from the Landau-Zener probability $P_{LZ}$ are found to
appear for large couplings only, when $P$ is very small; this explains why the
Landau-Zener model is often seen to provide more accurate results than
expected. In the second type of nonlinearity, called {\it essential}
nonlinearity, the detuning is proportional to an odd power of time. Then the
nonadiabatic probability $P$ is qualitatively and quantitatively different from
$P_{LZ}$ because on the one hand, it vanishes in an oscillatory manner as the
coupling increases, and on the other, it is much larger than $P_{LZ}$. We
suggest an experimental situation when this deviation can be observed.

general, curved) Cauchy surfaces. Classically, this dynamical evolution is
represented by a canonical transformation on the phase space for the field
theory. We show that this canonical transformation cannot, in general, be
unitarily implemented on the Fock space for free quantum fields on flat
spacetimes of dimension greater than 2. We do this by considering time
evolution of a free Klein-Gordon field on a flat spacetime (with toroidal
Cauchy surfaces) starting from a flat initial surface and ending on a generic
final surface. The associated Bogolubov transformation is computed; it does not
correspond to a unitary transformation on the Fock space. This means that
functional evolution of the quantum state as originally envisioned by Tomonaga,
Schwinger, and Dirac is not a viable concept. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that
functional evolution of the quantum state can be satisfactorily described using
the formalism of algebraic quantum field theory. We discuss possible
implications of our results for canonical quantum gravity.

  square well</title><description>  Quantum mechanics of a particle in an infinite square well under the
influence of a time-dependent electric field is reconsidered. In some gauge,
the Hamiltonian depends linearly on the momentum operator which is symmetric
but not self-adjoint when defined on a finite interval. In spite of this
symmetric part, the Hamiltonian operator is shown to be self-adjoint. This
follows from a theorem by Kato and Rellich which guarantees the stability of a
self-adjoint operator under certain symmetric perturbations. The result, which
has been assumed tacitly by other authors, is important in order to establish
the equivalence of different Hamiltonian operators related to each other by
quantum gauge transformations. Implications for the quantization procedure of a
particle in a box are pointed out.

upon (incomplete) adiabatic population transfer between an initial state
$\psi_1$ and state $\psi_3$ through an intermediate state $\psi_2$. As in
STIRAP, the Stokes pulse arrives before the pump pulse, but unlike STIRAP, the
two pulses terminate simultaneously while maintaining a constant ratio of

area makes it the analog of conventional STIRAP in the creation of coherent
superpositions of states. We suggest a smooth realization of f-STIRAP which
requires only two laser pulses (which can be derived from a single laser) and
at the same time ensures the automatic fulfillment of the asymptotic conditions
at early and late times. Furthermore, we provide simple analytic estimates of
the robustness of f-STIRAP against variations in the pulse intensity, the pulse

The conflict is resolved using a `measurement field', which provides a timelike
function of spacetime points and a definition of simultaneity in the context of
a curved spacetime. Locally this theory is consistent with special relativity,
but globally, special relativity is not enough; the time dilation of general
relativity and the standard cosmic time of the Robertson-Walker cosmologies are
both essential. A simple but crude example is a relativistic quantum
measurement dynamics based on the nonrelativistic measurement dynamics of

tetrad generally relativistic method of Tetrode-Weyl-Fock-Ivanenko for
describing a spinor particle is exploited. The choice of the formalism has
turned out to be of great fruitfulness for examining the system. It is matter
that, as known, the use of a special spherical tetrad in the theory of a spin
1/2 particle had led Schrodinger to a basis of remarkable features. The basis
has been used with great efficiency by Pauli in his investigation on the pro-
blem of allowed spherically symmetric wave functions in quantum mechanics. For
our purposes, just several simple rules extracted from the much more com-
prehensive Pauli's analysis will be quite sufficient; those are almost mnemo-
nic working regulations. So, one may remember some very primary facts of D-
functions theory and then produce automatically proper wave functions. It seems
rather likely, that there may exist a generalized analog of such a re-
presentation for J(i)-operators, that might be successfully used whenever in a
linear problem there exists a spherical symmetry, irrespective of the con-
crete embodiment of such a symmetry. In particular, the case of electron in the
external Abelian monopole field completely come under the Sch-Pau method.

fied with the approach that occurred with regard to a spin 1/2 particle and was
first developed by Tetrode, Weyl, Fock, Ivanenko. On that way a general- ly
relativistical Duffin-Kemmer equation is costructed. So, the manner of
extending the flat space Dirac equation to general relativity case indicates
clearly that the Lorentz group underlies equally both these theories. In other
words, the Lorentz group retains its importance and significance at changing
the Minkowski space model to an arbitrary curved space-time. In contrast to
this, at generalizing the Proca formulation, we automatically destroy any
relations to the Lorentz group, although the definition itself for a spin 1
particle as an elementary object was based on just this group. Such a gravity's
sensitiveness to the fermion-boson division might appear rather strange and
unattractive asymmetry, being subjected to the criticism. Moreover, just this
feature has brought about a plenty of speculation on this matter. In any case,
this peculiarity of particle-gravity field inter- action is recorded almost in

the relationship between squeezing and entangled coherent states, since a weak
nonlinear evolution produces a squeezed output, while a strong nonlinear
evolution produces a two-mode, two-state entangled coherent state. In between
these two extremes exist superpositions of two-mode coherent states manifesting
varying degrees of entanglement for arbitrary values of the nonlinearity. The
cardinality of the basis set of the entangled coherent states is finite when
the ratio $\chi / \pi$ is rational, where $\chi$ is the nonlinear strength. We
also show that entangled coherent states can be produced from product coherent
states via a nonlinear medium without the need for the interferometric

shown that the monopole case can be labelled as a very spesific and even rather

given on the interval [0,pi] having a single point of discontinuity; these

  mechanics</title><description>  Symmetries are defined in histories-based generalized quantum mechanics
paying special attention to the class of history theories admitting
quasitemporal structure (a generalization of the concept of `temporal
sequences' of `events' using partial semigroups) and logic structure for
`single time histories'. Symmetries are classified into orthochronous (those
preserving the `temporal order' of `events') and non-orthochronous. A
straightforward criterion for physical equivalence of histories is formulated
in terms of orthochronous symmetries; this criterion covers various notions of
physical equivalence considered by Gell-Mann and Hartle as special cases. In
familiar situations, a reciprocal relationship between traditional symmetries
(Wigner symmetries in quantum mechanics and Borel-measurable transformations of
phase space in classical mechanics) and symmetries defined in this work is
established. In a restricted class of theories, a definition of conservation
law is given in the history language which agrees with the standard ones in
familiar situations; in a smaller subclass of theories, a Noether type theorem
(implying a connection between continuous symmetries of dynamics and
conservation laws) is proved.

the density matrix is considered as an objective extra space dimension.
&quot;Particle&quot; solutions are found, which are perfectly localized both in position
space and in momentum space (the position and momentum operators commute in the
density matrix representation); definitions for all observable quantities are
given and the values associated to the &quot;particle&quot; solutions are the correct
ones, both for the non-relativistic and the relativistic case. Finally, a
non-linear interaction (the electromagnetic one) is introduced in an attempt to
single out the &quot;particle&quot; solutions of the Dirac equation from all other
solutions; the dynamical evolution of the electromagnetic field is described by
the classical (unquantized) Maxwell equations.

One protocol is the recently implemented quadrature phase approach of

on recognising that a two mode squeezed vacuum state is also entangled with

that the photon number spectrum is bounded from below by zero. Our examples
show that a given entanglement resource may admit more than a single
teleportation protocol and the question then arises as to what is the optimum

shown to work analogously to sideband cooling of a single ion. Outside the
Lamb-Dicke regime, the incommensurable frequencies of the two vibrational modes
result in a quasi-continuous energy spectrum that significantly alters the
cooling dynamics. The cooling time decreases nonlinearly with the linewidth of

and mean entropy of states on translationally invariant systems (classical
lattice, quantum lattice and quantum continuous). By taking the property of
strong subadditivity, which for quantum systems was proven rather late in the
historical development, as one of four primary axioms (the other three being
simply positivity, subadditivity and translational invariance) we are able to
obtain results, some new, some proved in a new way, which appear to complement
in an interesting way results proved around thirty years ago on limiting mean
entropy and related questions. In particular, we prove that as the sizes of
boxes in Z^n or R^n increase in the sense of set inclusion, (1) their mean
entropy decreases monotonically and (2) their entropy increases monotonically.
Our proof of (2) uses the notion of &quot;m-point correlation entropies&quot; which we
introduce and which generalize the notion of &quot;index of correlation&quot; (see e.g.
R. Horodecki, Phys. Lett. A 187 p145 1994). We mention a number of further
results and questions concerning monotonicity of mean entropy for more general
shapes than boxes and for more general translationally invariant (/homogeneous)
lattices and spaces than Z^n or R^n.

theoretical evidence that quantum computers, if built, might be used as a
dramatically powerful computational tool. This review is about to tell the
story of theoretical quantum computation. I left out the developing topic of
experimental realizations of the model, and neglected other closely related
topics which are quantum information and quantum communication. As a result of
narrowing the scope of this paper, I hope it has gained the benefit of being an
almost self contained introduction to the exciting field of quantum
computation.
  The review begins with background on theoretical computer science, Turing
machines and Boolean circuits. In light of these models, I define quantum
computers, and discuss the issue of universal quantum gates. Quantum
algorithms, including Shor's factorization algorithm and Grover's algorithm for
searching databases, are explained. I will devote much attention to
understanding what the origins of the quantum computational power are, and what
the limits of this power are. Finally, I describe the recent theoretical
results which show that quantum computers maintain their complexity power even
in the presence of noise, inaccuracies and finite precision. I tried to put all
results in their context, asking what the implications to other issues in
computer science and physics are. In the end of this review I make these
connections explicit, discussing the possible implications of quantum
computation on fundamental physical questions, such as the transition from
quantum to classical physics.

external fluctuating electrical fields, which cause statistical movement

the potential applied in the Paul trap for ions. We write down master equations

latter induces a dislocation in the incident wavefronts that is analogous to
what happens in the Aharonov-Bohm effect for the scattering of electrons by a
confined magnetic field. In addition to this global similarity between these
two physical systems there is scattering. This paper reports a detailed
calculation of this scattering, which is quantitatively different from the
electronic case in that a surface wave penetrates the inside of a vortex while
electrons do not penetrate a solenoid. This difference, together with an
additional difference in the equations that govern both physical systems lead
to a quite different scattering in the case of surface waves, whose main
characteristic is a strong asymmetry in the scattering cross section. The
assumptions and approximations under which these effects happen are carefully
considered, and their applicability to the case of scattering of acoustic waves
by vorticity is noted.

effects are treated perturbatively around the shallow water limit, to first
order in the ratio of depth to wavelength. The dislocation of the incident
wavefront, analogous to the Aharonov-Bohm effect, is still observed. At short
wavelengths the scattering is qualitatively similar to the nondispersive case.
At moderate wavelengths, however, there are two markedly different scattering
regimes according to wether the capillary length is smaller or larger than
$\sqrt{3}$ times depth. The dislocation is characterized by a parameter that
depends both on phase and group velocity. The validity range of the calculation
is the same as in the shallow water case: wavelengths small compared to vortex
radius, and low Mach number. The implications of these limitations are
carefully considered.

under some symmetry operations consisting of an Abelian subgroup in the complex
rotational group SO(3.C). This symmetry results in a certain (A)-freedom in
choosing a discrete operator entering the complete set {H, j^{2}, j_{3}, N(A),
K} . The same complex number A represents a parameter of the wave functions
constructed. The generalized inversion-like operator N(A) implies its own
(A-dependent) de- finition for scalar and pseudoscalar, and further affords
some generalized N(A)-parity selection rules. It is shown that all different
sets of basis func- tions Psi(A) determine the same Hilbert space. In
particular, the functions Psi(A) decompose into linear combinations of
Psi(A=0). However, the bases con- sidered turn out to be nonorthogonal ones
when A is not real number; the latter correlates with the non-self-conjugacy
property of the operator N(A) at those A-s.

configuration of its $N$ extrema situated at $p$-fold symmetry axis, physical
characteristics of the spin depend periodically on $J$ with the period equal to
$p$. The problem of the spectrum and eigenstates of the large spin $J$ is
equivalent to analogous problem for a scalar charged particle confined to a

$J$. This analogy as well as strong difference between close values of $J$
stems from the Berry's phase occurring in the problem. For energies close to
the extrema of the CEF, the problem can be formulated as Harper's equation on
the sphere. The $2J+1$-dimensional space of states is splitted into smaller
multiplets of classically degenerated states. These multiplets in turn are
splitted into submultiplets of states transforming according to specific
irreducible representations of the symmetry group determined by $J$ and $p$. We

that the dynamics of the measured system depends only on the information

at the price of decreasing the transition probability (weak Zeno effect). The

friction, be it translational or precessional, destabilizes the system.
  Quantum-mechanically, we study the problem of spin S=h_bar/2 particle in the
same field. Treating K as a small parameter for the perturbation from the
adiabatic Hamiltonian, we find that the lifetime T_esc of the particle in its
trapped ground-state is T_esc={T_vib}/{128 pi^2} * exp{2/K} where T_vib is the
classical period of the particle when placed in the adiabatic potential V=mue

states generated in a nonlinear crystal pumped by femtosecond optical pulses.
Interference patterns generated by the polarization analog of the
Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer are studied. Attention is devoted to the effects
of the pump-pulse profile (pulse duration and chirp) and the second-order
dispersion in both the nonlinear crystal and the interferometer's optical
elements. Dispersion causes the interference pattern to have an asymmetric
shape. Dispersion cancellation occurs in some cases.

quantum dots with few excited particles are chaotic superpositions of shell
model basis states. We study criterion for the equilibrium distribution of
basis components (ergodicity, or Quantum Chaos), effects of level density
variation and transition from the Breit-Wigner to the Gaussian shape of
eigenstates and strength functions. In the model of $n$ interacting particles
distributed over $m$ orbitals, the shape is given by the Breit-Wigner function

from the point of view of quantum compound states. We show that t he
classical-quantum correspondences such as encodings can be treated as dia gonal
(d-) entanglements. The mutual entropy of the d-compound and entangled states
lead to two different types of entropies for a given quantum state: t he von
Neumann entropy, which is achieved as the supremum of the information over all
d-entanglements, and the dimensional entropy, which is achieved at the standard
entanglement, the true quantum entanglement, coinciding with a d-entanglement
only in the case of pure marginal states. The q-capacity of a quantum noiseless
channel, defined as the supremum over all entanglements, i s given by the
logarithm of the dimensionality of the input algebra. It doub les the classical
capacity, achieved as the supremum over all d-entanglement s (encodings), which
is bounded by the logarithm of the dimensionality of a maximal Abelian
subalgebra.

  resonance fluorescence</title><description>  It is shown that 100% squeezed output can be produced in the resonance
fluorescence from a coherently driven two-level atom interacting with a
squeezed vacuum. This is only possible for $N=1/8$ squeezed input, and is
associated with a pure atomic state, i.e., a completely polarized state. The
quadrature for which optimal squeezing occurs depends on the squeezing phase
$\Phi ,$ the Rabi frequency $\Omega ,$ and the atomic detuning $\Delta $. Pure
states are described for arbitrary $\Phi ,$ not just $\Phi =0$ or $\pi $ as in
previous work. For small values of $N,$ there may be a greater degree of
squeezing in the output field than the input - i.e., we have squeezing
amplification.

entangled states, such as the Bell-states and the GHZ-states, which is
essential in certain processes of quantum communication, computation, and
teleportation. No interaction between the individual parts of the entangled
system, nor with any environment is required. A small probe (e.g. a single
qubit) takes care of all interaction with the system, and is used repeatedly.
The probe-qubit interaction is of the simplest form, and only this one type of
interaction is required to perform a complete measurement. The process may be
divided into elementary local operations and interactions, taking place
sequentially as the probe visits each of the qubits. A shuttle mode is
described, which may be repeated indefinitely. By the quantum Zeno effect, the
entangled states can be maintained until released in a predictable state. This
shuttle process is stable, and self-correcting, by virtue of the standard
measurements performed repeatedly on the probe.

  Spectroscopy</title><description>  This paper surveys our recent research on quantum information processing by
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. We begin with a geometric
introduction to the NMR of an ensemble of indistinguishable spins, and then
show how this geometric interpretation is contained within an algebra of
multispin product operators. This algebra is used throughout the rest of the
paper to demonstrate that it provides a facile framework within which to study
quantum information processing more generally. The implementation of quantum
algorithms by NMR depends upon the availability of special kinds of mixed
states, called pseudo-pure states, and we consider a number of different
methods for preparing these states, along with analyses of how they scale with
the number of spins. The quantum-mechanical nature of processes involving such
macroscopic pseudo-pure states also is a matter of debate, and in order to
discuss this issue in concrete terms we present the results of NMR experiments
which constitute a macroscopic analogue Hardy's paradox. Finally, a detailed
product operator description is given of recent NMR experiments which
demonstrate a three-bit quantum error correcting code, using field gradients to
implement a precisely-known decoherence model.

  Diffusion</title><description>  The Nelson stochastic mechanics of inhomogeneous quantum diffusion in flat
spacetime with a tensor of diffusion can be described as a homogeneous one in a
Riemannian manifold where this tensor of diffusion plays the role of a metric
tensor. It is shown that the such diffusion accelerates both a sample particle
and a local frame such that their mean accelerations do not depend on their
masses. This fact, explaining the principle of equivalence, allows one to
represent the curvature and gravitation as consequences of the quantum
fluctuations. In this diffusional treatment of gravitation it can be naturally
explained the fact that the energy density of the instantaneous Newtonian
interaction is negative defined.
